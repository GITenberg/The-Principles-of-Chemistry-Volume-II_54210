<p>Columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 give the molecular composition of the hydrogen and metallo-organic compounds, exhibiting the most characteristic forms
assumed by the elements. The first column contains only those which correspond to the form RX<sub>4</sub>, the second column those of the form RX<sub>3</sub>, the third
of the form RX<sub>2</sub>, and the fourth of the form RX, so that the periodicity stands out clearly (see Column 16).</p>

<p>Column 5 contains the symbols of all the more or less well-known elements, placed according to the order of the magnitude of their atomic weights.</p>

<p>Column 6 contains the atomic weights of the elements according to the most trustworthy determinations. The names of the investigators are
given in parenthesis. The atomic weight of oxygen, taken as 16, forms the basis upon which these atomic weights were calculated. Some of these
have been recalculated by me on the basis of Stas's most trustworthy data (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_398">XXIV.</a> and the numbers given by Stas in the table, where they
are taken according to van der Plaats and Thomsen's calculations).</p>

<p>Columns 7&ndash;14 contain the composition of the saline compounds of the elements, placed according to their forms, RX, RX<sub>2</sub> to RX<sub>8</sub> (in the 14<sup>th</sup>
column). If the element R has a metallic character like H, Li, Be, &amp;c., then X represents Cl, NO<sub>3</sub>, &frac12; SO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c., haloid radicles, or (OH) if a perfect
hydrate is formed (alkali, aqueous base), or &frac12; O, &frac12; S, &amp;c. when an anhydrous oxide, sulphide, &amp;c. is formed. For instance, NaCl, Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,
correspond to NaX, MgX<sub>2</sub>, and AlX<sub>3</sub>; so also Na(OH), Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>, Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>O, MgO, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. But if the element, like C or N, be of a metalloid
or acid character, X must be regarded as (OH) in the formation of hydrates; (OM) in the formation of salts, where M is the equivalent of a
metal, &frac12; O in the formation of an anhydride, and Cl in the formation of a chloranhydride; and in this case (<i>i.e.</i> in the acid compounds) Z is put in
the place of X; for example, the formulæ COZ<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>Z, MNO<sub>2</sub>Z, FeO<sub>2</sub>Z<sub>2</sub>, and IZ<sub>3</sub> correspond to CO(NaO)<sub>2</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, COCl<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>(NaO) = NaNO<sub>3</sub>,
NO<sub>2</sub>Cl, NO<sub>2</sub>(OH) = HNO<sub>3</sub>; MnO<sub>3</sub>(OK) = KMnO<sub>4</sub>, ICl, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The 15th column gives the compositions of the peroxides of the elements, <i>taking them as anhydrous</i>. An asterisk (*) is attached to those of which
the composition has not been well established, and a dash (&mdash;) shows that for a given element no peroxides have yet been obtained. The peroxides
contain more oxygen than the higher saline oxides of the same elements, are powerfully oxidising, and easily give peroxide of hydrogen. This latter
circumstance necessitates their being referred to the type of peroxide of hydrogen, if bases and acids are referred to the type of water (see Chapter XV.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_7_9">7</a> and <a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_14">11 bis</a>).</p>

<p>The 16th column gives the composition of the lower hydrogen compounds like N<sub>3</sub>H and Na<sub>2</sub>H. They may often be regarded as alloys of hydrogen,
which is frequently disengaged by them at a comparatively moderate temperature. They differ greatly in their nature from the hydrogen compounds
given in columns 1&ndash;4 (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_12_15">12</a>).</p>

<p>Column 17 gives the specific gravity of the elements in a solid and a liquid state. An asterisk (*) is placed by those which can either only be
assumed from analogy (for example, the sp. gr. of fluorine and hydrogen, which have not been obtained in a liquid state), or which vary very rapidly
with a variation of temperature and pressure (like oxygen and nitrogen), or physical state (for instance, carbon in passing from the state of charcoal
to graphite and diamond). But as the sp. gr. in general varies with the temperature, mechanical condition, &amp;c., the figures given, although chosen
from the most trustworthy sources, can only be regarded as approximate, and not as absolutely true. They clearly show a certain periodicity; for
instance, the sp. gr. diminishes from Al on both sides (Al, Mg, Na, with decreasing atomic weight; and Al, Si, P, S, Cl, with increasing atomic weight,
it also diminishes on both sides from Cu, Ru, and Os.)</p>

<p>The same remarks refer to the figures in the 18th column, which gives the so-called atomic volumes of the simple bodies, or the quotient of their
atomic weight and specific gravity. For Na, K, Rb, and Cs the atomic volume is greatest among the neighbouring elements. For Ni, Pd, and Os it is
least, and this indicates the periodicity of this property of the simple bodies.</p>

<p>The last (19th) column gives the melting points of the simple bodies. Here also a periodicity is seen, i.e. a maximum and minimum value
between which there are intermediate values, as we see, for instance, in the series Cl, K, Ca, Sc, and Ti, or in the series Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn,
Ga, and Ge.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 125%;">PRINCIPLES OF CHEMISTRY</span><br /><br />
CHAPTER XV<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE GROUPING OF THE ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC LAW</span></h2>

<p>It is seen from the examples given in the preceding chapters that the
sum of the data concerning the chemical transformations proper to the
elements (for instance, with respect to the formation of acids, salts,
and other compounds having definite properties) is insufficient for
accurately determining the relationship of the elements, inasmuch
as this may be many-sided. Thus, lithium and barium are in
some respects analogous to sodium and potassium, and in others to
magnesium and calcium. It is evident, therefore, that for a complete
judgment it is necessary to have, not only qualitative, but also
quantitative, exact and measurable, data. When a property can be measured
it ceases to be vague, and becomes quantitative instead of
merely qualitative.</p>

<p>Among these measurable properties of the elements, or of their
corresponding compounds, are: (<i>a</i>) isomorphism, or the analogy of
crystalline forms; and, connected with it, the power to form crystalline
mixtures which are isomorphous; (<i>b</i>) the relation of the volumes of
analogous compounds of the elements; (<i>c</i>) the composition of their
saline compounds; and (<i>d</i>) the relation of the atomic weights of the
elements. In this chapter we shall briefly consider these four aspects
of the matter, which are exceedingly important for a natural and
fruitful grouping of the elements, facilitating, not only a general
acquaintance with them, but also their detailed study.</p>

<p>Historically the first, and an important and convincing, method for
finding a relationship between the compounds of two different elements
is by <i>isomorphism</i>. This conception was introduced into chemistry
by Mitscherlich (in 1820), who demonstrated that the corresponding
salts of arsenic acid, H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>, and phosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, crystallise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
with an equal quantity of water, show an exceedingly close resemblance
in crystalline form (as regards the angles of their faces and axes), and
are able to crystallise together from solutions, forming crystals containing
a mixture of the isomorphous compounds. Isomorphous substances
are those which, with an equal number of atoms in their
molecules, present an analogy in their chemical reactions, a close
resemblance in their properties, and a similar or very nearly similar
crystalline form: they often contain certain elements in common, from
which it is to be concluded that the remaining elements (as in the
preceding example of As and P) are analogous to each other. And
inasmuch as crystalline forms are capable of exact measurement,
the external form, or the relation of the molecules which causes
their grouping into a crystalline form, is evidently as great a help in
judging of the internal forces acting between the atoms as a comparison
of reactions, vapour densities, and other like relations. We have
already seen examples of this in the preceding pages.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It will be
sufficient to call to mind that the compounds of the alkali metals
with the halogens RX, in a crystalline form, all belong to the cubic
system and crystallise in octahedra or cubes&mdash;for example, sodium
chloride, potassium chloride, potassium iodide, rubidium chloride, &amp;c.
The nitrates of rubidium and cæsium appear in anhydrous crystals of
the same form as potassium nitrate. The carbonates of the metals of
the alkaline earths are isomorphous with calcium carbonate&mdash;that is,
they either appear in forms like calc spar or in the rhombic system
in crystals analogous to aragonite.<a name="FNanchor_1_BIS_3" id="FNanchor_1_BIS_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_BIS_3" class="fnanchor">[1 bis]</a> Furthermore, sodium nitrate
crystallises in rhombohedra, closely resembling the rhombohedra of calc
spar (calcium carbonate), CaCO<sub>3</sub>, whilst potassium nitrate appears in the
same form as aragonite, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and the number of atoms in both kinds
of salts is the same: they all contain one atom of a metal (K, Na, Ca), one
atom of a non-metal (C, N), and three atoms of oxygen. The analogy
of form evidently coincides with an analogy of atomic composition.
But, as we have learnt from the previous description of these salts, there
is not any close resemblance in their properties. It is evident that calcium
carbonate approaches more nearly to magnesium carbonate than to sodium
nitrate, although their crystalline forms are all equally alike. Isomorphous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
substances which are perfectly analogous to each other are not
only characterised by a close resemblance of form (homeomorphism), but
also by the faculty of entering into analogous reactions, which is not the
case with RNO<sub>3</sub> and RCO<sub>3</sub>. The most important and direct method of
recognising perfect isomorphism&mdash;that is, the absolute analogy of two
compounds&mdash;is given by that property of analogous compounds of
separating from solutions <i>in homogeneous crystals, containing the
most varied proportions</i> of the analogous substances which enter
into their composition. These quantities do not seem to be in
dependence on the molecular or atomic weights, and if they are
governed by any laws they must be analogous to those which apply to
indefinite chemical compounds.<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> This will be clear from the following
examples. Potassium chloride and potassium nitrate are not
isomorphous with each other, and are in an atomic sense composed
in a different manner. If these salts be mixed in a solution and
the solution be evaporated, independent crystals of the two salts will
separate, each in that crystalline form which is proper to it. The
crystals will not contain a mixture of the two salts. But if we
mix the solutions of two isomorphous salts together, then, under
certain circumstances, crystals will be obtained which contain both
these substances. However, this cannot be taken as an absolute rule,
for if we take a solution saturated at a high temperature with a
mixture of potassium and sodium chlorides, then on evaporation sodium
chloride only will separate, and on cooling only potassium chloride.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
The first will contain very little potassium chloride, and the latter
very little sodium chloride.<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But if we take, for example, a mixture
of solutions of magnesium sulphate and zinc sulphate, they cannot
be separated from each other by evaporating the mixture, notwithstanding
the rather considerable difference in the solubility of these
salts. Again, the isomorphous salts, magnesium carbonate, and calcium
carbonate are found together&mdash;that is, in one crystal&mdash;in nature.
The angle of the rhombohedron of these magnesia-lime spars is intermediate
between the angles proper to the two spars individually (for calcium
carbonate, the angle of the rhombohedron is 105° 8&#8242;; magnesium
carbonate, 107° 30&#8242;; CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 106° 10&#8242;). Certain of these <i>isomorphous
mixtures</i> of calc and magnesia spars appear in well-formed crystals,
and in this case there not unfrequently exists a simple molecular proportion
of strictly definite chemical combination between the component
salts&mdash;for instance, CaCO<sub>3</sub>,MgCO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;whilst in other cases, especially in
the absence of distinct crystallisation (in dolomites), no such simple
molecular proportion is observable: this is also the case in many
artificially prepared isomorphous mixtures. The microscopical and
crystallo-optical researches of Professor Inostrantzoff and others
show that in many cases there is really a mechanical, although microscopically
minute, juxtaposition in one whole of the heterogeneous
crystals of calcium carbonate (double refracting) and of the compound
CaMgC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. If we suppose the adjacent parts to be microscopically
small (on the basis of the researches of Mallard, Weruboff, and others),
we obtain an idea of isomorphous mixtures. A formula of the following
kind is given to isomorphous mixtures: for instance, for spars,
RCO<sub>3</sub>, where R = Mg, Ca, and where it may be Fe,Mn &hellip;, &amp;c. This
means that the Ca is partially replaced by Mg or another metal.
Alums form a common example of the separation of isomorphous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
mixtures from solutions. They are double sulphates (or seleniates)
of alumina (or oxides isomorphous with it) and the alkalis, which
crystallise in well-formed crystals. If aluminium sulphate be mixed
with potassium sulphate, an alum separates, having the composition
KAlS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O. If sodium sulphate or ammonium sulphate, or
rubidium (or thallium) sulphate be used, we obtain alums having the
composition RAlS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O. Not only do they all crystallise in the
cubic system, but they also contain an equal atomic quantity of water
of crystallisation (12H<sub>2</sub>O). Besides which, if we mix solutions of the
potassium and ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>AlS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O) alums together, then
the crystals which separate will contain various proportions of the
alkalis taken, and separate crystals of the alums of one or the other
kind will not be obtained, but each separate crystal will contain both
potassium and ammonium. Nor is this all; if we take a crystal of a
potassium alum and immerse it in a solution capable of yielding
ammonia alum, the crystal of the potash alum will continue to
grow and increase in size in this solution&mdash;that is, a layer of the
ammonia or other alum will deposit itself upon the planes bounding
the crystal of the potash alum. This is very distinctly seen if a colourless
crystal of a common alum be immersed in a saturated violet solution
of chrome alum, KCrS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, which then deposits itself in a
violet layer over the colourless crystal of the alumina alum, as was
observed even before Mitscherlich noticed it. If this crystal be then
immersed in a solution of an alumina alum, a layer of this salt will
form over the layer of chrome alum, so that one alum is able to incite
the growth of the other. If the deposition proceed simultaneously, the
resultant intermixture may be minute and inseparable, but its nature is
understood from the preceding experiments; the attractive force of
crystallisation of isomorphous substances is so nearly equal that the
attractive power of an isomorphous substance induces a crystalline superstructure
exactly the same as would be produced by the attractive force
of like crystalline particles. From this it is evident that one isomorphous
substance may <i>induce the crystallisation</i><a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of another. Such a phenomenon
explains, on the one hand, the aggregation of different isomorphous
substances in one crystal, whilst, on the other hand, it serves as a most
exact indication of the nearness both of the molecular composition of
isomorphous substances and of those forces which are proper to the
elements which distinguish the isomorphous substances. Thus, for
example, ferrous sulphate or green vitriol crystallises in the monoclinic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
system and contains seven molecules of water, FeSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, whilst
copper vitriol crystallises with five molecules of water in the triclinic
system, CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O; nevertheless, it may be easily proved that both
salts are perfectly isomorphous; that they are able to appear in identically
the same forms and with an equal molecular amount of water.
For instance, Marignac, by evaporating a mixture of sulphuric acid
and ferrous sulphate under the receiver of an air-pump, first obtained
crystals of the hepta-hydrated salt, and then of the penta-hydrated
salt FeSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, which were perfectly similar to the crystals of copper
sulphate. Furthermore, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, by immersing crystals
of FeSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O in a supersaturated solution of copper sulphate, caused
the latter to deposit in the same form as ferrous sulphate, in crystals
of the monoclinic system, CuSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Hence it is evident that isomorphism&mdash;that is, the analogy of forms
and the property of inducing crystallisation&mdash;may serve as a means for
the discovery of analogies in molecular composition. We will take an
example in order to render this clear. If, instead of aluminium sulphate,
we add magnesium sulphate to potassium sulphate, then, on
evaporating the solution, the double salt K<sub>2</sub>MgS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O (Chapter
XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_28_855">28</a>) separates instead of an alum, and the ratio of
the component parts (in alums one atom of potassium per 2SO<sub>4</sub>, and
here two atoms) and the amount of water of crystallisation (in alums
12, and here 6 equivalents per 2SO<sub>4</sub>) are quite different; nor is this
double salt in any way isomorphous with the alums, nor capable of
forming an isomorphous crystalline mixture with them, nor does the
one salt provoke the crystallisation of the other. From this we
must conclude that although alumina and magnesia, or aluminium
and magnesium, resemble each other, they are not isomorphous,
and that although they give partially similar double salts, these salts
are not analogous to each other. And this is expressed in their
chemical formulæ by the fact that the number of atoms in alumina or
aluminium oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is different from the number in magnesia, MgO.
Aluminium is trivalent and magnesium bivalent. Thus, having obtained
a double salt from a given metal, it is possible to judge of the analogy
of the given metal with aluminium or with magnesium, or of the
absence of such an analogy, from the composition and form of this
salt. Thus zinc, for example, does not form alums, but forms a double
salt with potassium sulphate, which has a composition exactly like that
of the corresponding salt of magnesium. It is often possible to distinguish
the bivalent metals analogous to magnesium or calcium from
the trivalent metals, like aluminium, by such a method. Furthermore,
the specific heat and vapour density serve as guides. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
also indirect proofs. Thus iron gives ferrous compounds, FeX<sub>2</sub>, which
are isomorphous with the compounds of magnesium, and ferric
compounds, FeX<sub>3</sub>, which are isomorphous with the compounds of
aluminium; in this instance the relative composition is directly
determined by analysis, because, for a given amount of iron, FeCl<sub>2</sub>
only contains two-thirds of the amount of chlorine which occurs in
FeCl<sub>3</sub>, and the composition of the corresponding oxygen compounds,
<i>i.e.</i> of ferrous oxide, FeO, and ferric oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, clearly indicates
the analogy of the ferrous oxide with MgO and of the ferric oxide
with Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Thus in the building up of similar molecules in crystalline forms we
see one of the numerous means for judging of the internal world of
molecules and atoms, and one of the weapons for conquests in the
invisible world of molecular mechanics which forms the main object of
physico-chemical knowledge. This method<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> has more than once been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
employed for discovering the analogy of elements and of their compounds;
and as crystals are measurable, and the capacity to form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
crystalline mixtures can be experimentally verified, this method is a
numerical and measurable one, and in no sense arbitrary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The regularity and simplicity expressed by the exact laws of crystalline
form repeat themselves in the aggregation of the atoms to form
molecules. Here, as there, there are but few forms which are essentially
different, and their apparent diversity reduces itself to a few
fundamental differences of type. There the molecules aggregate
themselves into crystalline forms; here, the atoms aggregate themselves
into molecular forms or into <i>the types of compounds</i>. In both
cases the fundamental crystalline or molecular forms are liable to
variations, conjunctions, and combinations. If we know that potassium
gives compounds of the fundamental type KX, where X is a univalent
element (which combines with one atom of hydrogen, and is, according
to the law of substitution, able to replace it), then we know the composition
of its compounds: K<sub>2</sub>O, KHO, KCl, NH<sub>2</sub>K, KNO<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
KHSO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>Mg(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c. All the possible derivative crystalline
forms are not known. So also all the atomic combinations are not
known for every element. Thus in the case of potassium, KCH<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>3</sub>P,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
K<sub>2</sub>Pt, and other like compounds which exist for hydrogen or chlorine,
are unknown.</p>

<p>Only a few fundamental types exist for the building up of atoms
into molecules, and the majority of them are already known to us. If
X stand for a univalent element, and R for an element combined with
it, then eight atomic types may be observed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">RX, RX<sub>2</sub>, RX<sub>3</sub>, RX<sub>4</sub>, RX<sub>5</sub>, RX<sub>6</sub>, RX<sub>7</sub>, RX<sub>8</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Let X be chlorine or hydrogen. Then as examples of the first type
we have: H<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, HCl, KCl, NaCl, &amp;c. The compounds of oxygen or
calcium may serve as examples of the type RX<sub>2</sub>: OH<sub>2</sub>, OCl<sub>2</sub>, OHCl,
CaO, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. For the third type RX<sub>3</sub> we know the
representative NH<sub>3</sub> and the corresponding compounds N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, NO(OH),
NO(OK), PCl<sub>3</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, PH<sub>3</sub>, SbH<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.
The type RX<sub>4</sub> is known among the hydrogen compounds. Marsh gas,
CH<sub>4</sub>, and its corresponding saturated hydrocarbons, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>, are the
best representatives. Also CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, CCl<sub>4</sub>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, SnCl<sub>4</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>,
and a whole series of other compounds come under this class. The type
RX<sub>5</sub> is also already familiar to us, but there are no purely hydrogen
compounds among its representatives. Sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and
the corresponding NH<sub>4</sub>(OH), NO<sub>2</sub>(OH), ClO<sub>2</sub>(OK), as well as PCl<sub>5</sub>,
POCl<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., are representatives of this type. In the higher types also
there are no hydrogen compounds, but in the type RX<sub>6</sub> there is
the chlorine compound WCl<sub>6</sub>. However, there are many oxygen compounds,
and among them SO<sub>3</sub> is the best known representative. To this
class also belong SO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>(OH)Cl, CrO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., all of an
acid character. Of the higher types there are in general only oxygen
and acid representatives. The type RX<sub>7</sub> we know in perchloric acid,
ClO<sub>3</sub>(OH), and potassium permanganate, MnO<sub>3</sub>(OK), is also a member.
The type RX<sub>8</sub> in a free state is very rare; osmic anhydride, OsO<sub>4</sub>, is
the best known representative of it.<a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The four lower types RX, RX<sub>2</sub>, RX<sub>3</sub>, and RX<sub>4</sub> are met with in
compounds of the elements R with chlorine and oxygen, and also in
their compounds with hydrogen, whilst the four higher types only
appear for such acid compounds as are formed by chlorine, oxygen, and
similar elements.</p>

<p>Among the oxygen compounds the <i>saline oxides</i> which are capable
of forming salts either through the function of a base or through the
function of an acid anhydride attract the greatest interest in every
respect. Certain elements, like calcium and magnesium, only give one
saline oxide&mdash;for example, MgO, corresponding with the type MgX<sub>2</sub>.
But the majority of the elements appear in several such forms. Thus
copper gives CuX and CuX<sub>2</sub>, or Cu<sub>2</sub>O and CuO. If an element R
gives a higher type RX<sub><i>n</i></sub>, then there often also exist, as if by symmetry,
lower types, RX<sub><i>n</i>-2</sub>, RX<sub><i>n</i>-4</sub>, and in general such types as differ from
RX<sub><i>n</i></sub> by an even number of X. Thus in the case of sulphur the
types SX<sub>2</sub>, SX<sub>4</sub>, and SX<sub>6</sub> are known&mdash;for example SH<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and
SO<sub>3</sub>. The last type is the highest, SX<sub>6</sub>. The types SX<sub>5</sub> and SX<sub>3</sub> do
not exist. But even and uneven types sometimes appear for one
and the same element. Thus the types RX and RX<sub>2</sub> are known for
copper and mercury.</p>

<p>Among the <i>saline</i> oxides only the <i>eight types</i> enumerated below
are known to exist. They determine the possible formulæ of the compounds
of the elements, if it be taken into consideration that an
element which gives a certain type of combination may also give
lower types. For this reason the rare type of the <i>suboxides</i> or
quaternary oxides R<sub>4</sub>O (for instance, Ag<sub>4</sub>O, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl) is not characteristic;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
it is always accompanied by one of the higher grades of oxidation,
and the compounds of this type are distinguished by their great
chemical instability, and split up into an element and the higher compound
(for instance, Ag<sub>4</sub>O = 2Ag + Ag<sub>2</sub>O). Many elements, moreover,
form transition oxides whose composition is intermediate, which are
able, like N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, to split up into the lower and higher oxides. Thus
iron gives magnetic oxide, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which is in all respects (by its reactions)
a compound of the suboxide FeO with the oxide Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The
independent and more or less stable saline compounds correspond with
the following eight types :&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="i1">R<sub>2</sub>O; salts RX, hydroxides ROH. Generally basic like K<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>O,
Hg<sub>2</sub>O, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, Cu<sub>2</sub>O; if there are acid oxides of this composition they
are very rare, are only formed by distinctly acid elements, and even
then have only feeble acid properties; for example, Cl<sub>2</sub>O and N<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p class="i1">R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or RO; salts RX<sub>2</sub>, hydroxides R(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The most simple basic
salts R<sub>2</sub>OX<sub>2</sub> or R(OH)X; for instance, the chloride Zn<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub>; also
an almost exclusively basic type; but the basic properties are more
feebly developed than in the preceding type. For example, CaO,
MgO, BaO, PbO, FeO, MnO, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="i1">R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; salts RX<sub>3</sub>, hydroxides R(OH)<sub>3</sub>, RO(OH), the most simple basic
salts ROX, R(OH)X<sub>3</sub>. The bases are feeble, like Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
Tl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The acid properties are also feebly developed; for
instance, in B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; but with the non-metals the properties of acids
are already clear; for instance, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, P(OH)<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="i1">R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or RO<sub>2</sub>; salts RX<sub>4</sub> or ROX<sub>2</sub>, hydroxides R(OH)<sub>4</sub>, RO(OH)<sub>2</sub>.
Rarely bases (feeble), like ZrO<sub>2</sub>, PtO<sub>2</sub>; more often acid oxides;
but the acid properties are in general feeble, as in CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>,
SnO<sub>2</sub>. Many intermediate oxides appear in this and the preceding
and following types.</p>

<p class="i1">R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; salts principally of the types ROX<sub>3</sub>, RO<sub>2</sub>X, RO(OH)<sub>3</sub>,
RO<sub>2</sub>(OH), rarely RX<sub>5</sub>. The basic character (X, a halogen,
simple or complex; for instance, NO<sub>3</sub>, Cl, &amp;c.) is feeble; the acid
character predominates, as is seen in N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; then
X = OH, OK, &amp;c., for example NO<sub>2</sub>(OK).</p>

<p class="i1">R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> or RO<sub>3</sub>; salts and hydroxides generally of the type RO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>,
RO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Oxides of an acid character, as SO<sub>3</sub>, CrO<sub>3</sub>, MnO<sub>3</sub>.
Basic properties rare and feebly developed as in UO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p class="i1">R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>; salts of the form RO<sub>3</sub>X, RO<sub>3</sub>(OH), acid oxides; for instance,
Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. Basic properties as feebly developed as the acid
properties in the oxides R<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p class="i1">R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> or RO<sub>4</sub>. A very rare type, and only known in OsO<sub>4</sub> and
RuO<sub>4</sub>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident from the circumstance that in all the higher types
the <i>acid hydroxides</i> (for example, HClO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and salts
with a single atom of one element contain, like the higher saline
type RO<sub>4</sub>, <i>not more than four atoms of oxygen</i>; that the formation
of the saline oxides is governed by a certain common principle which
is best looked for in the fundamental properties of oxygen, and in
general of the most simple compounds. The hydrate of the oxide
RO<sub>2</sub> is of the higher type RO<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O = RH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> = R(HO)<sub>4</sub>. Such,
for example, is the hydrate of silica and the salts (orthosilicates)
corresponding with it, Si(MO)<sub>4</sub>. The oxide R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, corresponds with
the hydrate R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O = 2RH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> = 2RO(OH)<sub>3</sub>. Such is orthophosphoric
acid, PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The hydrate of the oxide RO<sub>3</sub> is
RO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O = RH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> = RO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>&mdash;for instance, sulphuric acid. The
hydrate corresponding to R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is evidently RHO = RO<sub>3</sub>(OH)&mdash;for
example, perchloric acid. Here, besides containing O<sub>4</sub>, it
must further be remarked that <i>the amount of hydrogen in the hydrate
is equal to the amount of hydrogen in the hydrogen compound</i>. Thus
silicon gives SiH<sub>4</sub> and SiH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, phosphorus PH<sub>3</sub> and PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, sulphur
SH<sub>2</sub> and SH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, chlorine ClH and ClHO<sub>4</sub>. This, if it does not
explain, at least connects in a harmonious and general system the
fact that <i>the elements are capable of combining with a greater amount of
oxygen, the less the amount of hydrogen which they are able to retain</i>.
In this the key to the comprehension of all further deductions must be
looked for, and we will therefore formulate this rule in general terms.
An element R gives a hydrogen compound RH<sub><i>n</i></sub>, the hydrate of its
higher oxide will be RH<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and therefore the higher oxide will contain
2RH<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>4</sub> - <i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O = R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8 - <i>n</i></sub>. For example, chlorine gives ClH, hydrate
ClHO<sub>4</sub>, and the higher oxide Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. Carbon gives CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>.
So also, SiO<sub>2</sub> and SiH<sub>4</sub> are the higher compounds of silicon with
hydrogen and oxygen, like CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>. Here the amounts of oxygen
and hydrogen are equivalent. Nitrogen combines with a large amount
of oxygen, forming N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, but, on the other hand, with a small quantity
of hydrogen in NH<sub>3</sub>. <i>The sum of the equivalents of hydrogen and
oxygen</i>, occurring in combination with an atom of nitrogen, is, as
always in the higher types, equal to <i>eight</i>. It is the same with the
other elements which combine with hydrogen and oxygen. Thus
sulphur gives SO<sub>3</sub>; consequently, six equivalents of oxygen fall to an
atom of sulphur, and in SH<sub>2</sub> two equivalents of hydrogen. The sum
is again equal to eight. The relation between Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and ClH is the
same. This shows that the property of elements of combining with
such different elements as oxygen and hydrogen is subject to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
common law, which is also formulated in the system of the elements
presently to be described.<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>In the preceding we see not only the regularity and simplicity
which govern the formation and properties of the oxides and of all the
compounds of the elements, but also a fresh and exact means for
recognising the analogy of elements. Analogous elements give compounds
of analogous types, both higher and lower. If CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> are
two gases which closely resemble each other both in their physical and
chemical properties, the reason of this must be looked for not in an
analogy of sulphur and carbon, but in that identity of the type
of combination, RX<sub>4</sub>, which both oxides assume, and in that influence
which a large mass of oxygen always exerts on the properties
of its compounds. In fact, there is little resemblance between carbon
and sulphur, as is seen not only from the fact that CO<sub>2</sub> is the <i>higher
form</i> of oxidation, whilst SO<sub>2</sub> is able to further oxidise into SO<sub>3</sub>, but
also from the fact that all the other compounds&mdash;for example, SH<sub>2</sub> and
CH<sub>4</sub>, SCl<sub>2</sub> and CCl<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c.&mdash;are entirely unlike both in type and in
chemical properties. This absence of analogy in carbon and sulphur
is especially clearly seen in the fact that the highest saline oxides
are of different composition, CO<sub>2</sub> for carbon, and SO<sub>3</sub> for sulphur. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_338">VIII.</a> we considered the limit to which carbon tends in
its compounds, and in a similar manner there is for every element in
its compounds a tendency to attain a certain highest limit RX<sub><i>n</i></sub>. This
view was particularly developed in the middle of the present century
by Frankland in studying the metallo-organic compounds, <i>i.e.</i> those in
which X is wholly or partially a hydrocarbon radicle; for instance,
X = CH<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> &amp;c. Thus, for example, antimony, Sb (Chapter <a href="#Page_149">XIX.</a>)
gives, with chlorine, compounds SbCl<sub>3</sub> and SbCl<sub>5</sub> and corresponding
oxygen compounds Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, whilst under the action of CH<sub>3</sub>I,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I, or in general EI (where E is a hydrocarbon radicle of the
paraffin series), upon antimony or its alloy with sodium there are
formed SbE<sub>3</sub> (for example, Sb(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, boiling at about 81°), which,
corresponding to the lower form of combination SbX<sub>3</sub>, are able to
combine further with EI, or Cl<sub>2</sub>, or O, and to form compounds of the
limiting type SbX<sub>5</sub>; for example, SbE<sub>4</sub>Cl corresponding to NH<sub>4</sub>Cl with
the substitution of nitrogen by antimony, and of hydrogen by the
hydrocarbon radicle. The elements which are most chemically analogous
are characterised by the fact of their giving compounds of similar form
RX<sub><i>n</i></sub>. The halogens which are analogous give both higher and lower
compounds. So also do the metals of the alkalis and of the alkaline
earths. And we saw that this analogy extends to the composition and
properties of the nitrogen and hydrogen compounds of these metals,
which is best seen in the salts. Many such groups of analogous
elements have long been known. Thus there are analogues of oxygen,
nitrogen, and carbon, and we shall meet with many such groups. But
an acquaintance with them inevitably leads to the questions, what
is the cause of analogy and what is the relation of one group to
another? If these questions remain unanswered, it is easy to fall into
error in the formation of the groups, because the notions of the degree
of analogy will always be relative, and will not present any accuracy
or distinctness Thus lithium is analogous in some respects to
potassium and in others to magnesium; beryllium is analogous to
both aluminium and magnesium. Thallium, as we shall afterwards
see and as was observed on its discovery, has much kinship with
lead and mercury, but some of its properties appertain to lithium and
potassium. Naturally, where it is impossible to make measurements
one is reluctantly obliged to limit oneself to approximate comparisons,
founded on apparent signs which are not distinct and are wanting
in exactitude. But in the elements there is one accurately measurable
property, which is subject to no doubt&mdash;namely, that property which is
expressed in their atomic weights. Its magnitude indicates the relative
mass of the atom, or, if we avoid the conception of the atom, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
magnitude shows the relation between the masses forming the chemical
and independent individuals or elements. And according to the teaching
of all exact data about the phenomena of nature, the mass of a substance
is that property on which all its remaining properties must be
dependent, because they are all determined by similar conditions or
by those forces which act in the weight of a substance, and this is
directly proportional to its mass. Therefore it is most natural to seek
for a dependence between the properties and analogies of the elements
on the one hand and their atomic weights on the other.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental idea which leads <i>to arranging all the
elements according to their atomic weights</i>. A periodic repetition of properties
is then immediately observed in the elements. We are already
familiar with examples of this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The essence of the matter is seen in these groups. The halogens
have smaller atomic weights than the alkali metals, and the latter
than the metals of the alkaline earths. Therefore, <i>if all the elements
be arranged in the order of their atomic weights, a periodic repetition
of properties is obtained</i>. This is expressed by the <i>law of periodicity</i>,
<i>the properties of the elements, as well as the forms and properties
of their compounds, are in periodic dependence or (expressing ourselves
algebraically) form a periodic function of the atomic weights of
the elements</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Table I. of <i>the periodic system of the elements</i>, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
placed at the very beginning of this book, is designed to illustrate
this law. It is arranged in conformity with the eight types of
oxides described in the preceding pages, and those elements which give
the oxides, R<sub>2</sub>O and consequently salts RX, form the 1st group; the
elements giving R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or RO as their highest grade of oxidation belong
to the 2nd group; those giving R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as their highest oxides form the
3rd group, and so on; whilst the elements of all the groups which are
nearest in their atomic weights are arranged in series from 1 to 12.
The even and uneven series of the same groups present the same forms
and limits, but differ in their properties, and therefore two contiguous
series, one even and the other uneven&mdash;for instance, the 4th and 5th&mdash;form
a period. Hence the elements of the 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th,
or of the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th, series form analogues, like the
halogens, the alkali metals, &amp;c. The conjunction of two series, one even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and one contiguous uneven series, thus forms one large <i>period</i>. These
periods, beginning with the alkali metals, end with the halogens. The
elements of the first two series have the lowest atomic weights, and in
consequence of this very circumstance, although they bear the general
properties of a group, they still show many peculiar and independent
properties.<a name="FNanchor_9_11" id="FNanchor_9_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_11" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Thus fluorine, as we know, differs in many points from
the other halogens, and lithium from the other alkali metals, and
so on. These lightest elements may be termed <i>typical elements</i>. They
include&mdash;</p>

<p>H.</p>
<p>Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F.</p>
<p>Na, Mg....</p>

<p>In the annexed table all the remaining elements are arranged, not
in groups and series, but <i>according to periods</i>. In order to understand
the essence of the matter, it must be remembered that here the
atomic weight gradually increases along a given line; for instance, in
the line commencing with K = 39 and ending with Br = 80, the intermediate
elements have intermediate atomic weights, as is clearly seen
in <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a>, where the elements stand in the order of their atomic
weights.</p>

is very important to see that all the aspects of the distribution
of the elements according to their atomic weights essentially express
one and the same fundamental <i>dependence</i>&mdash;<i>periodic properties</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_13" id="FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_13" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
following points then must be remarked in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The composition of the higher oxygen compounds is determined
by the groups: the first group gives R<sub>2</sub>O, the second R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or RO,
the third R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. There are eight types of oxides and therefore
eight groups. Two groups give a period, and the same type of oxide
is met with twice in a period. For example, in the period beginning
with potassium, oxides of the composition RO are formed by calcium
and zinc, and of the composition RO<sub>3</sub> by molybdenum and tellurium.
The oxides of the even series, of the same type, have stronger basic
properties than the oxides of the uneven series, and the latter as a
rule are endowed with an acid character. Therefore the elements
which exclusively give bases, like the alkali metals, will be found at the
commencement of the period, whilst such purely acid elements as the
halogens will be at the end of the period. The interval will be occupied
by intermediate elements, whose character and properties we shall
afterwards describe. It must be observed that the acid character is
chiefly proper to the elements with small atomic weights in the uneven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
series, whilst the basic character is exhibited by the heavier elements
in the even series. Hence elements which give acids chiefly predominate
among the lightest (typical) elements, especially in the last groups;
whilst the heaviest elements, even in the last groups (for instance,
thallium, uranium) have a basic character. Thus the basic and acid
characters of the higher oxides are determined (<i>a</i>) by the type of oxide,
(<i>b</i>) by the even or uneven series, and (<i>c</i>) by the atomic weight.<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_14" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_14" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a>
The groups are indicated by Roman numerals from I. to VIII.</p>

<p>2. <i>The hydrogen compounds</i> being volatile or gaseous substances
which are prone to reaction&mdash;such as HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>3</sub>N, and H<sub>4</sub>C<a name="FNanchor_12_15" id="FNanchor_12_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_15" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&mdash;are
only formed by the elements of the uneven series and higher groups
giving oxides of the forms R<sub>2</sub>O<sub><i>n</i></sub>, RO<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and RO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>3. If an element gives a hydrogen compound, RX<sub><i>m</i></sub>, it forms an
<i>organo-metallic compound</i> of the same composition, where X = C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+1</sub>;
that is, X is the radicle of a saturated hydrocarbon. The elements of
the uneven series, which are incapable of giving hydrogen compounds,
and give oxides of the forms RX, RX<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>X</sub>3, also give organo-metallic
compounds of this form proper to the higher oxides. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
zinc forms the oxide ZnO, salts ZnX<sub>2</sub> and zinc ethyl Zn(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. The
elements of the even series do not seem to form organo-metallic compounds
at all; at least all efforts for their preparation have as yet
been fruitless&mdash;for instance, in the case of titanium, zirconium, or
iron.</p>

<p>4. The atomic weights of elements belonging to contiguous periods
differ approximately by 45; for example, K&#60;Rb, Cr&#60;Mo, Br&#60;I.
But the elements of the typical series show much smaller differences.
Thus the difference between the atomic weights of Li, Na, and K,
between Ca, Mg, and Be, between Si and C, between S and O, and
between Cl and F, is 16. As a rule, there is a greater difference
between the atomic weights of two elements of one group and belonging
to two neighbouring series (Ti-Si = V-P = Cr-S = Mn-Cl
= Nb-As, &amp;c. = 20); and this difference attains a maximum with the
heaviest elements (for example, Th-Pb = 26, Bi-Ta = 26, Ba-Cd
= 25, &amp;c.). Furthermore, the difference between the atomic weights
of the elements of even and uneven series also increases. In fact, the
differences between Na and K, Mg and Ca, Si and Ti, are less abrupt
than those between Pb and Th, Ta and Bi, Cd and Ba, &amp;c. Thus even
in the magnitude of the differences of the atomic weights of analogous
elements there is observable a certain connection with the gradation of
their properties.<a name="FNanchor_12_BIS_16" id="FNanchor_12_BIS_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_BIS_16" class="fnanchor">[12 bis]</a></p>

<p>5. According to the periodic system every element occupies a certain
position, determined by the group (indicated in Roman numerals)
and series (Arabic numerals) in which it occurs. These indicate the
atomic weight, the analogues, properties, and type of the higher oxide,
and of the hydrogen and other compounds&mdash;in a word, all the chief
quantitative and qualitative features of an element, although there yet
remain a whole series of further details and peculiarities whose cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
should perhaps be looked for in small differences of the atomic weights.
If in a certain group there occur elements, R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, and if in that
series which contains one of these elements, for instance R<sub>2</sub>, an
element Q<sub>2</sub> precedes it and an element T<sub>2</sub> succeeds it, then the properties
of R<sub>2</sub> are determined by the properties of R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>3</sub>, Q<sub>2</sub>, and T<sub>2</sub>.
Thus, for instance, the atomic weight of R<sub>2</sub> = &frac14;(R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>3</sub> + Q<sub>2</sub> + T<sub>2</sub>).
For example, selenium occurs in the same group as sulphur, S = 32, and
tellurium, Te = 125, and, in the 7th series As = 75 stands before it and
Br = 80 after it. Hence the atomic weight of selenium should be
&frac14;(32 + 125 + 75 + 80) = 78, which is near to the truth. Other properties
of selenium may also be determined in this manner. For example,
arsenic forms H<sub>3</sub>As, bromine gives HBr, and it is evident that selenium,
which stands between them, should form H<sub>2</sub>Se, with properties intermediate
between those of H<sub>3</sub>As and HBr. Even the physical
properties of selenium and its compounds, not to speak of their composition,
being determined by the group in which it occurs, may be foreseen
with a close approach to reality from the properties of sulphur, tellurium,
arsenic, and bromine. <i>In this manner it is possible to foretell the properties
of still unknown elements.</i> For instance in the position IV, 5&mdash;that
is, in the IVth group and 5th series&mdash;an element is still wanting.
These unknown elements may be named after the preceding known element
of the same group by adding to the first syllable the prefix <i>eka</i>-,
which means <i>one</i> in Sanskrit. The element IV, 5, follows after IV, 3,
and this latter position being occupied by silicon, we call the unknown
element ekasilicon and its symbol Es. The following are
the properties which this element should have on the basis of the
known properties of silicon, tin, zinc, and arsenic. Its atomic weight
is nearly 72, higher oxide EsO<sub>2</sub>, lower oxide EsO, compounds of the
general form EsX<sub>4</sub>, and chemically unstable lower compounds of the
form EsX<sub>2</sub>. Es gives volatile organo-metallic compounds&mdash;for instance,
Es(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, Es(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl, and Es(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, which boil at about 160°, &amp;c.;
also a volatile and liquid chloride, EsCl<sub>4</sub>, boiling at about 90° and of
specific gravity about 1·9. EsO<sub>2</sub> will be the anhydride of a feeble colloidal
acid, metallic Es will be rather easily obtainable from the oxides
and from K<sub>2</sub>EsF<sub>6</sub> by reduction, EsS<sub>2</sub> will resemble SnS<sub>2</sub> and SiS<sub>2</sub>, and
will probably be soluble in ammonium sulphide; the specific gravity
of Es will be about 5·5, EsO<sub>2</sub> will have a density of about 4·7, &amp;c.
Such a prediction of the properties of ekasilicon was made by me in
1871, on the basis of the properties of the elements analogous to it:
IV, 3, = Si, IV, 7 = Sn, and also II, 5 = Zn and V, 5 = As. And now
that this element has been discovered by C. Winkler, of Freiberg, it
has been found that its actual properties entirely correspond with those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which were foretold.<a name="FNanchor_13_17" id="FNanchor_13_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_17" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In this we see a most important confirmation
of the truth of the periodic law. This element is now called germanium,
Ge (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_99">XVIII</a>.). It is not the only one that has been
predicted by the periodic law.<a name="FNanchor_14_18" id="FNanchor_14_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_18" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> We shall see in describing the elements
of the third group that properties were foretold of an element ekaaluminium,
III, 5, El = 68, and were afterwards verified when the
metal termed &lsquo;gallium&rsquo; was discovered by De Boisbaudran. So also the
properties of scandium corresponded with those predicted for ekaboron,
according to Nilson.<a name="FNanchor_15_19" id="FNanchor_15_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_19" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>6. As a true law of nature is one to which there are no exceptions,
the periodic dependence of the properties on the atomic weights
of the elements gives a <i>new means for determining by the equivalent
the atomic weight</i> or atomicity of imperfectly investigated but
known elements, for which no other means could as yet be applied
for determining the true atomic weight. At the time (1869) when the
periodic law was first proposed there were several such elements. It
thus became possible to learn their true atomic weights, and these were
verified by later researches. Among the elements thus concerned were
indium, uranium, cerium, yttrium, and others.</p>

<p>7. The periodic variability of the properties of the elements in
dependence on their masses presents a distinction from other kinds
of periodic dependence (as, for example, the sines of angles vary
periodically and successively with the growth of the angles, or the
temperature of the atmosphere with the course of time), in that the
weights of the atoms do not increase gradually, but by leaps; that is,
according to Dalton's law of multiple proportions, there not only are
not, but there cannot be, any transitive or intermediate elements between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
two neighbouring ones (for example, between K = 39 and Ca = 40, or
Al = 27 and Si = 28, or C = 12 and N = 14, &amp;c.) As in a molecule
of a hydrogen compound there may be either one, as in HF, or two, as
in H<sub>2</sub>O, or three, as in NH<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., atoms of hydrogen; but as there cannot
be molecules containing 2&frac12; atoms of hydrogen to one atom of another
element, so there cannot be any element intermediate between N and
O, with an atomic weight greater than 14 or less than 16, or between
K and Ca. Hence the periodic dependence of the elements cannot be
expressed by any algebraical continuous function in the same way that
it is possible, for instance, to express the variation of the temperature
during the course of a day or year.</p>

<p>8. The essence of the notions giving rise to the periodic law consists
in a general physico-mechanical principle which recognises the
correlation, transmutability, and equivalence of the forces of nature.
Gravitation, attraction at small distances, and many other phenomena
are in direct dependence on the mass of matter. It might therefore have
been expected that chemical forces would also depend on mass. A dependence
is in fact shown, the properties of elements and compounds
being determined by the masses of the atoms of which they are formed.
The weight of a molecule, or its mass, determines, as we have seen,
(Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_299">VII.</a> and elsewhere) many of its properties independently of
its composition. Thus carbonic oxide, CO, and nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, are two
gases having the same molecular weight, and many of their properties
(density, liquefaction, specific heat, &amp;c.) are similar or nearly similar.
The differences dependent on the nature of a substance play another
part, and form magnitudes of another order. But the properties of
atoms are mainly determined by their mass or weight, and are in
dependence upon it. Only in this case there is a peculiarity in the
dependence of the properties on the mass, for this <i>dependence is determined
by a periodic law</i>. As the mass increases the properties
vary, at first successively and regularly, and then return to their
original magnitude and recommence a fresh period of variation like
the first. Nevertheless here as in other cases a small variation of the
mass of the atom generally leads to a small variation of properties, and
determines differences of a second order. The atomic weights of cobalt
and nickel, of rhodium, ruthenium, and palladium, and of osmium,
iridium, and platinum, are very close to each other, and their properties
are also very much alike&mdash;the differences are not very perceptible.
And if the properties of atoms are a function of their weight,
many ideas which have more or less rooted themselves in chemistry
must suffer change and be developed and worked out in the sense of
this deduction. Although at first sight it appears that the chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
elements are perfectly independent and individual, instead of this idea
of the nature of the elements, the notion of the dependence of their properties
upon <i>their mass</i> must now be established; that is to say, the subjection
of the individuality of the elements to a common higher principle
which evinces itself in gravity and in all physico-chemical phenomena.
Many chemical deductions then acquire a new sense and significance,
and a regularity is observed where it would otherwise escape
attention. This is more particularly apparent in the physical properties,
to the consideration of which we shall afterwards turn, and we
will now point out that Gustavson first (Chapter X., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_28_600">28</a>) and
subsequently Potilitzin (Chapter XI., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_66_692">66</a>) demonstrated the direct
dependence of the reactive power on the atomic weight and that fundamental
property which is expressed in the forms of their compounds,
whilst in a number of other cases the purely chemical relations of elements
proved to be in connection with their periodic properties. As
a case in point, it may be mentioned that Carnelley remarked a dependence
of the decomposability of the hydrates on the position of the
elements in the periodic system; whilst L. Meyer, Willgerodt, and
others established a connection between the atomic weight or the
position of the elements in the periodic system and their property of
serving as media in the transference of the halogens to the hydrocarbons.<a name="FNanchor_16_20" id="FNanchor_16_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_20" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Bailey pointed out a periodicity in the stability (under the
action of heat) of the oxides, namely: (<i>a</i>) in the even series (for
instance, CrO<sub>3</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub>, and UO<sub>3</sub>) the higher oxides of a given
group decompose with greater ease the smaller the atomic weight,
while in the uneven series (for example, CO<sub>2</sub>, GeO<sub>2</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, and PbO<sub>2</sub>)
the contrary is the case; and (<i>b</i>) the stability of the higher saline
oxides in the even series (as in the fourth series from K<sub>2</sub>O to
Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) decreases in passing from the lower to the higher groups,
while in the uneven series it increases from the Ist to the IVth group,
and then falls from the IVth to the VIIth; for instance, in the series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Ag<sub>2</sub>O, CdO, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, and then SnO<sub>2</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, TeO<sub>3</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.
K. Winkler looked for and actually found (1890) a dependence between
the reducibility of the metals by magnesium and their position in the
periodic system of the elements. The greater the attention paid to
this field the more often is a distinct connection found between the
variation of purely chemical properties of analogous substances and
the variation of the atomic weights of the constituent elements and
their position in the periodic system. Besides, since the periodic
system has become more firmly established, many facts have been
gathered, showing that there are many similarities between Sn and
Pb, B and Al, Cd and Hg, &amp;c., which had not been previously observed,
although foreseen in some cases, and a consequence of the periodic law.
Keeping our attention in the same direction, we see that the most
widely distributed elements in nature are those with small atomic
weights, whilst in organisms the lightest elements exclusively predominate
(hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen), whose small mass facilitates
those transformations which are proper to organisms. Poluta
(of Kharkoff), C. C. Botkin, Blake, Brenton, and others even discovered
a correlation between the physiological action of salts and other reagents
on organisms and the positions occupied in the periodic system
by the metals contained in them.<a name="FNanchor_17_21" id="FNanchor_17_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_21" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>As, from the necessity of the case, the physical properties must be
in dependence on the composition of a substance, <i>i.e.</i> on the quality
and quantity of the elements forming it, so for them also a dependence
on the atomic weight of the component elements must be
expected, and consequently also on their periodic distribution. We
shall meet with repeated proofs of this in the further exposition of
our treatise, and for the present will content ourselves with citing
the discovery by Carnelley in 1879 of the dependence of the magnetic
properties of the elements on the position occupied by them in the
periodic system. Carnelley showed that all the elements of the <i>even</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<i>series</i> (beginning with lithium, potassium, rubidium, cæsium) belong
to the number of magnetic (paramagnetic) substances; for example,
according to Faraday and others,<a name="FNanchor_17_BIS_22" id="FNanchor_17_BIS_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_BIS_22" class="fnanchor">[17 bis]</a> C, N, O, K, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co,
Ni, Ce, are magnetic; and the elements of the <i>uneven series are
diamagnetic</i>, H, Na, Si, P, S, Cl, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Br, Ag, Cd, Sn, Sb,
I, Au, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi.</p>

<p>Carnelley also showed that the <i>melting-point</i> of elements varies
periodically, as is seen by the figures in <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a> (nineteenth column),<a name="FNanchor_18_23" id="FNanchor_18_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_23" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
where all the most trustworthy data are collected, and predominance
is given to those having maximum and minimum values.<a name="FNanchor_19_24" id="FNanchor_19_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_24" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a><br /><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that many other physical properties will, when
further studied, also prove to be in periodic dependence on the atomic
weights,<a name="FNanchor_19_BIS_25" id="FNanchor_19_BIS_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_BIS_25" class="fnanchor">[19 bis]</a> but at present only a few are known with any completeness,
and we will only refer to the one which is the most easily and
frequently determined&mdash;namely, the <i>specific gravity</i> in a solid and
liquid state, the more especially as its connection with the chemical
properties and relations of substances is shown at every step. Thus,
for instance, of all the metals those of the alkalis, and of all the non-metals
the halogens, are the most energetic in their reactions, and they
have the lowest specific gravity among the adjacent elements, as is seen
in <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a>, column 17. Such are sodium, potassium, rubidium,
cæsium among the metals, and chlorine, bromine, and iodine among the
non-metals; and as such less energetic metals as iridium, platinum,
and gold (and even charcoal or the diamond) have the highest specific
gravity among the elements near to them in atomic weight; therefore
the degree of the condensation of matter evidently influences the
course of the transformations proper to a substance, and furthermore
this dependence on the atomic weight, although very complex, is of a
clearly periodic character. In order to account for this to some extent,
it may be imagined that the lightest elements are porous, and, like a
sponge, are easily penetrated by other substances, whilst the heavier
elements are more compressed, and give way with difficulty to the
insertion of other elements. These relations are best understood when,
instead of the specific gravities referring to a unit of volume,<a name="FNanchor_20_26" id="FNanchor_20_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_26" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the
<i>atomic volumes of the elements</i>&mdash;that is, the quotient <i>A</i>/<i>d</i> of the atomic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
weight <i>A</i> by the specific gravity <i>d</i>&mdash;are taken for comparison. As,
according to the entire sense of the atomic theory, the actual matter
of a substance does not fill up its whole cubical contents, but is surrounded
by a medium (ethereal, as is generally imagined), like the stars
and planets which travel in the space of the heavens and fill it, with
greater or less intervals, so the quotient <i>A</i>/<i>d</i> only expresses the <i>mean</i>
volume corresponding to the sphere of the atoms, and therefore [3root]<i>A</i>/<i>d</i>
<i>is the mean distance between the centres of the atoms</i>. For compounds
whose molecules weigh <i>M</i>, the mean magnitude of the atomic volume is
obtained by dividing the mean molecular volume <i>M</i>/<i>d</i> by the number
of atoms <i>n</i> in the molecule.<a name="FNanchor_21_27" id="FNanchor_21_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_27" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The above relations may easily be
expressed from this point of view by comparing the atomic volumes.
Those comparatively light elements which easily and frequently enter
into reaction have the greatest atomic volumes: sodium 23, potassium
45, rubidium 57, cæsium 71, and the halogens about 27; whilst with
those elements which enter into reaction with difficulty, the mean atomic
volume is small; for carbon in the form of a diamond it is less than
4, as charcoal about 6, for nickel and cobalt less than 7, for iridium
and platinum about 9. The remaining elements having atomic weights
and properties intermediate between those elements mentioned above
have also intermediate atomic volumes. Therefore <i>the specific gravities
and specific volumes of solids and liquids stand in periodic dependence
on the atomic weights</i>, as is seen in <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a>, where both <i>A</i> (the
atomic weight) and <i>d</i> (the specific gravity), and <i>A</i>/<i>d</i> (specific volumes
of the atoms) are given (column 18).</p>

<p>Thus we find that in the large periods beginning with lithium,
sodium, potassium, rubidium, cæsium, and ending with fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, iodine, the extreme members (energetic elements) have a
small density and large volume, whilst the intermediate substances
gradually increase in density and decrease in volume&mdash;that is, as the
atomic weight increases the density rises and falls, again rises and falls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and so on. Furthermore, the energy decreases as the density rises, and
the greatest density is proper to the atomically heaviest and least
energetic elements; for example, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, U.</p>

<p>In order to explain the relation between the volumes of the elements
and of their compounds, the densities (column S) and volumes
(column M/<i>s</i>) of some of the higher saline oxides arranged in the same
order as in the case of the elements are given on p. <a href="#Page_36">36</a>. For convenience
of comparison the volumes of the oxides are all calculated
per two atoms of an element combined with oxygen. For example,
the density of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 4·0, weight Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 102, volume Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 25·5.
Whence, knowing the volume of aluminium to be 11, it is at once seen
that in the formation of aluminium oxide, 22 volumes of it give 25·5
volumes of oxide. A distinct periodicity may also be observed with
respect to the specific gravities and volumes of the higher saline oxides.
Thus in each period, beginning with the alkali metals, the specific
gravity of the oxides first rises, reaches a maximum, and then falls on
passing to the acid oxides, and again becomes a minimum about the
halogens. But it is especially important to call attention to the fact
that the volume of the alkali oxides is less than that of the metal contained
in them, which is also expressed in the last column, giving this
difference for each atom of oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_22_28" id="FNanchor_22_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_28" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Thus 2 atoms of sodium, or
46 volumes, give 24 volumes of Na<sub>2</sub>O, and about 37 volumes of 2NaHO&mdash;that
is, the oxygen and hydrogen in distributing themselves in the
medium of sodium have not only not increased the distance between
its atoms, but have brought them nearer together, have drawn them
together by the force of their great affinity, by reason, it may be
presumed, of the small mutual attraction of the atoms of sodium.
Such metals as aluminium and zinc, in combining with oxygen and
forming oxides of feeble salt-forming capacity, hardly vary in volume,
but the common metals and non-metals, and especially those forming
acid oxides, always give an increased volume when oxidised&mdash;that is,
the atoms are set further apart in order to make room for the oxygen.
The oxygen in them does not compress the molecule as in the alkalis;
it is therefore comparatively easily disengaged.</p>

<p>As the volumes of the chlorides, organo-metallic and all other
corresponding compounds, also vary in a like periodic succession with a
change of elements, it is evidently possible to indicate the properties
of substances yet uninvestigated by experimental means, and even those
of yet undiscovered elements. It was possible by following this method
to foretell, on the basis of the periodic law, many of the properties of
scandium, gallium, and germanium, which were verified with great
accuracy after these metals had been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_23_29" id="FNanchor_23_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_29" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The periodic law,
therefore, has not only embraced the mutual relations of the elements
and expressed their analogy, but has also to a certain extent subjected
to law the doctrine of the types of the compounds formed by the
elements: it has enabled us to see a regularity in the variation of
all chemical and physical properties of elements and compounds, and
has rendered it possible to foretell the properties of elements and
compounds yet uninvestigated by experimental means; thus it has
prepared the ground for the building up of atomic and molecular
mechanics.<a name="FNanchor_24_30" id="FNanchor_24_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_30" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_4" id="Footnote_2_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_4"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Solutions furnish the commonest examples of indefinite chemical compounds. But the
isomorphous mixtures which are so common among the crystalline compounds of silica
forming the crust of the earth, as well as alloys, which are so important in the application
of metals to the arts, are also instances of indefinite compounds. And if in Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_40">I.</a>,
and in many other portions of this work, it has been necessary to admit the presence
of definite compounds (in a state of dissociation) in solutions, the same applies with
even greater force to isomorphous mixtures and alloys. For this reason in many places
in this work I refer to facts which compel us to recognise the existence of definite
chemical compounds in all isomorphous mixtures and alloys. This view of mine (which
dates from the sixties) upon isomorphous mixtures finds a particularly clear confirmation
in B. Roozeboom's researches (1892) upon the solubility and crystallising capacity of
mixtures of the chlorates of potassium and thallium, KClO<sub>3</sub> and TlClO<sub>3</sub>. He showed
that when a solution contains different amounts of these salts, it deposits crystals containing
either an excess of the first salt, from 98 p.c. to 100 p.c., or an excess of the second
salt, from 63·7 to 100 p.c.; that is, in the crystalline form, either the first salt saturates the
second or the second the first, just as in the solution of ether in water (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_40">I.</a>); moreover,
the solubility of the mixtures containing 36·3 and 98 p.c. KClO<sub>3</sub> is similar, just as the
vapour tension of a saturated solution of water in ether is equal to that of a saturated
solution of ether in water (Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_47_94">47</a>). But just as there are solutions miscible
in all proportions, so also certain isomorphous bodies can be present in crystals in
all possible proportions of their component parts. Van 't Hoff calls such systems &lsquo;solid
solutions.&rsquo; These views were subsequently elaborated by Nernst (1892), and Witt (1891)
applied them in explaining the phenomena observed in the coloration of tissues.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_5" id="Footnote_3_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_5"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The cause of the difference which is observed in different compounds of the same
type, with respect to their property of forming isomorphous mixtures, must not be looked
for in the difference of their volumetric composition, as many investigators, including
Kopp, affirm. The molecular volumes (found by dividing the molecular weight by the
density) of those isomorphous substances which do give intermixtures are not nearer to
each other than the volumes of those which do not give mixtures; for example, for magnesium
carbonate the combining weight is 84, density 3·06, and volume therefore 27; for
calcium carbonate in the form of calc spar the volume is 37, and in the form of aragonite
33; for strontium carbonate 41, for barium carbonate 46; that is, the volume of
these closely allied isomorphous substances increases with the combining weight. The
same is observed if we compare sodium chloride (molecular volume = 27) with potassium
chloride (volume = 37), or sodium sulphate (volume = 55) with potassium sulphate
(volume = 66), or sodium nitrate 39 with potassium nitrate 48, although the latter are
less capable of giving isomorphous mixtures than the former. It is evident that the
cause of isomorphism cannot be explained by an approximation in molecular volumes.
It is more likely that, given a similarity in form and composition, the faculty to give
isomorphous mixtures is connected with the laws and degree of solubility.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_7" id="Footnote_5_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_7"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The property of solids of occurring in regular crystalline forms&mdash;the occurrence of
many substances in the earth's crust in these forms&mdash;and those geometrical and simple
laws which govern the formation of crystals long ago attracted the attention of the naturalist
to crystals. The crystalline form is, without doubt, the expression of the relation
in which the atoms occur in the molecules, and in which the molecules occur in the mass,
of a substance. Crystallisation is determined by the distribution of the molecules along
the direction of greatest cohesion, and therefore those forces must take part in the
crystalline distribution of matter which act between the molecules; and, as they depend
on the forces binding the atoms together in the molecules, a very close connection
must exist between the atomic composition and the distribution of the atoms
in the molecule on the one hand, and the crystalline form of a substance on the
other hand; and hence an insight into the composition may be arrived at from the
crystalline form. Such is the elementary and <i>a priori</i> idea which lies at the base of all
researches into <i>the connection between composition and crystalline form</i>. Haüy in
1811 established the following fundamental law, which has been worked out by later
investigators: That the fundamental crystalline form for a given chemical compound is
constant (only the combinations vary), and that with a change of composition the crystalline
form also changes, naturally with the exception of such limiting forms as the cube,
regular octahedron, &amp;c., which may belong to various substances of the regular system.
The fundamental form is determined by the angles of certain fundamental geometric
forms (prisms, pyramids, rhombohedra), or the ratio of the crystalline axes, and is connected
with the optical and many other properties of crystals. Since the establishment
of this law the description of definite compounds in a solid state is accompanied by a
description (measurement) of its crystals, which forms an invariable, definite, and
measurable character. The most important epochs in the further history of this question
were made by the following discoveries:&mdash;Klaproth, Vauquelin, and others showed that
aragonite has the same composition as calc spar, whilst the former belongs to the
rhombic and the latter to the hexagonal system. Haüy at first considered that the composition,
and after that the arrangement, of the atoms in the molecules was different.
This is dimorphism (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_581">XIV.</a>, Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_46_874">46</a>). Beudant, Frankenheim, Laurent, and
others found that the forms of the two nitres, KNO<sub>3</sub> and NaNO<sub>3</sub>, exactly correspond
with the forms of aragonite and calc spar; that they are able, moreover, to pass from
one form into another; and that the difference of the forms is accompanied by a small
alteration of the angles, for the angle of the prisms of potassium nitrate and aragonite
is 119°, and of sodium nitrate and calc spar, 120°; and therefore dimorphism, or the
crystallisation of one substance in different forms, does not necessarily imply a great difference
in the distribution of the molecules, although some difference clearly exists. The researches
of Mitscherlich (1822) on the dimorphism of sulphur confirmed this conclusion,
although it cannot yet be affirmed that in dimorphism the arrangement of the atoms
remains unaltered, and that only the molecules are distributed differently. Leblanc,
Berthier, Wollaston, and others already knew that many substances of different composition
appear in the same forms, and crystallise together in one crystal. Gay-Lussac (1816)
showed that crystals of potash alum continue to grow in a solution of ammonia alum.
Beudant (1817) explained this phenomenon as the <i>assimilation</i> of a foreign substance by
a substance having a great force of crystallisation, which he illustrated by many natural
and artificial examples. But Mitscherlich, and afterwards Berzelius and Henry Rose and
others, showed that such an assimilation only exists with a similarity or approximate similarity
of the forms of the individual substances and with a certain degree of chemical
analogy. Thus was established the idea of <i>isomorphism</i> as an analogy of forms by
reason of a resemblance of atomic composition, and by it was explained the variability of
the composition of a number of minerals as isomorphous mixtures. Thus all the garnets
are expressed by the general formula: (RO)<sub>3</sub>M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, where R = Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn,
and M = Fe, Al, and where we may have either R and M separately, or their equivalent
compounds, or their mixtures in all possible proportions.</p>

<p>But other facts, which render the correlation of form and composition still more complex,
have accumulated side by side with a mass of data which may be accounted for by
admitting the conceptions of isomorphism and dimorphism. Foremost among the former
stand the phenomena of <i>homeomorphism</i>&mdash;that is, a nearness of forms with a difference
of composition&mdash;and then the cases of polymorphism and hemimorphism&mdash;that is, a
nearness of the fundamental forms or only of certain angles for substances which are
near or analogous in their composition. Instances of homeomorphism are very numerous.
Many of these, however, may be reduced to a resemblance of atomic composition,
although they do not correspond to an isomorphism of the component elements; for
example, CdS (greenockite) and AgI, CaCO<sub>3</sub> (aragonite) and KNO<sub>3</sub>, CaCO<sub>3</sub> (calc spar) and
NaNO<sub>3</sub>, BaSO<sub>4</sub> (heavy spar), KMnO<sub>4</sub> (potassium permanganate), and KClO<sub>4</sub> (potassium
perchlorate), Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (corundum) and FeTiO<sub>3</sub> (titanic iron ore), FeS<sub>2</sub> (marcasite, rhombic
system) and FeSAs (arsenical pyrites), NiS and NiAs, &amp;c. But besides these instances
there are homeomorphous substances with an absolute dissimilarity of composition.
Many such instances were pointed out by Dana. Cinnabar, HgS, and susannite,
PbSO<sub>4</sub>3PbCO<sub>3</sub> appear in very analogous crystalline forms; the acid potassium
sulphate crystallises in the monoclinic system in crystals analogous to felspar, KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>;
glauberite, Na<sub>2</sub>Ca(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, augite, RSiO<sub>3</sub> (R = Ca, Mg), sodium carbonate, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O,
Glauber's salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, and borax, Na<sub>2</sub>BrO<sub>7</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, not only belong to the same
system (monoclinic), but exhibit an analogy of combinations and a nearness of corresponding
angles. These and many other similar cases might appear to be perfectly
arbitrary (especially as a <i>nearness</i> of angles and fundamental forms is a relative idea)
were there not other cases where a resemblance of properties and a distinct relation
in the variation of composition is connected with a resemblance of form. Thus,
for example, alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and water, H<sub>2</sub>O, are frequently found in many pyroxenes
and amphiboles which only contain silica and magnesia (MgO, CaO, FeO, MnO).
Scheerer and Hermann, and many others, endeavoured to explain such instances
by <i>polymetric isomorphism</i>, stating that MgO may be replaced by 3H<sub>2</sub>O (for example,
olivine and serpentine), SiO<sub>2</sub> by Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (in the amphiboles, talcs), and so on. A
certain number of the instances of this order are subject to doubt, because many of the
natural minerals which served as the basis for the establishment of polymeric
isomorphism in all probability no longer present their original composition, but one
which has been altered under the influence of solutions which have come into contact
with them; they therefore belong to the class of <i>pseudomorphs</i>, or false crystals.
There is, however, no doubt of the existence of a whole series of natural and artificial
homeomorphs, which differ from each other by atomic amounts of water, silica, and some
other component parts. Thus, Thomsen (1874) showed a very striking instance. The
metallic chlorides, RCl<sub>2</sub>, often crystallise with water, and they do not then contain less
than one molecule of water per atom of chlorine. The most familiar representative of
the order RCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O is BaCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, which crystallises in the rhombic system. Barium
bromide, BaBr<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and copper chloride, CuCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, have nearly the same forms:
potassium iodate, KIO<sub>4</sub>; potassium chlorate, KClO<sub>4</sub>; potassium permanganate, KMnO<sub>4</sub>;
barium sulphate, BaSO<sub>4</sub>; calcium sulphate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>; sodium sulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; barium
formate, BaC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and others have almost the same crystalline form (of the rhombic
system). Parallel with this series is that of the metallic chlorides containing RCl<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O,
of the sulphates of the composition RSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and the formates RC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O.
These compounds belong to the monoclinic system, have a close resemblance of form, and
differ from the first series by containing two more molecules of water. The addition of two
more molecules of water in all the above series also gives forms of the monoclinic system
closely resembling each other; for example, NiCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O and MnSO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O. Hence we
see that not only is RCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O analogous in form to RSO<sub>4</sub> and RC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, but that their
compounds with 2H<sub>2</sub>O and with 4H<sub>2</sub>O also exhibit closely analogous forms. From these
examples it is evident that the conditions which determine a given form may be repeated
not only in the presence of an isomorphous exchange&mdash;that is, with an equal number of
atoms in the molecule&mdash;but also in the presence of an unequal number when there are
peculiar and as yet ungeneralised relations in composition. Thus ZnO and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
exhibit a close analogy of form. Both oxides belong to the rhombohedral system, and
the angle between the pyramid and the terminal plane of the first is 118° 7&#8242;, and of the
second 118° 49&#8242;. Alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is also analogous in form to SiO<sub>2</sub>, and we shall see
that these analogies of form are conjoined with a certain analogy in properties. It is
not surprising, therefore, that in the complex molecule of a siliceous compound it is
sometimes possible to replace SiO<sub>2</sub> by means of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, as Scheerer admits. The oxides
Cu<sub>2</sub>O, MgO, NiO, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, CeO<sub>2</sub>, crystallise in the regular system, although they are of
very different atomic structure. Marignac demonstrated the perfect analogy of the
forms of K<sub>2</sub>ZrF<sub>6</sub> and CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and the former is even dimorphous, like the calcium carbonate.
The same salt is isomorphous with R<sub>2</sub>NbOF<sub>5</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>, where R is an
alkali metal. There is an equivalency between CaCO<sub>3</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>ZrF<sub>6</sub>, because K<sub>2</sub> is
equivalent to Ca, C to Zr, and F<sub>6</sub> to O<sub>3</sub>, and with the isomorphism of the other two salts
we find besides an equal contents of the alkali metal&mdash;an equal number of atoms
on the one hand and an analogy to the properties of K<sub>2</sub>ZrF<sub>6</sub> on the other. The long-known
isomorphism of the corresponding compounds of potassium and ammonium, KX
and NH<sub>4</sub>X, may be taken as the simplest example of the fact that an analogy of form
shows itself with an analogy of chemical reaction even without an equality in atomic
composition. Therefore the ultimate progress of the entire doctrine of the correlation
of composition and crystalline forms will only be arrived at with the accumulation of a
sufficient number of facts collected on a plan corresponding with the problems which
here present themselves. The first steps have already been made. The researches of
the Geneva <i>savant</i>, Marignac, on the crystalline form and composition of many of the
double fluorides, and the work of Wyruboff on the ferricyanides and other compounds,
are particularly important in this respect. It is already evident that, with a definite
change of composition, certain angles remain constant, notwithstanding that others are
subject to alteration. Such an instance of the relation of forms was observed by
Laurent, and named by him <i>hemimorphism</i> (an anomalous term) when the analogy is
limited to certain angles, and <i>paramorphism</i> when the forms in general approach each
other, but belong to different systems. So, for example, the angle of the planes of a
rhombohedron may be greater or less than 90°, and therefore such acute and obtuse
rhombohedra may closely approximate to the cube. Hausmannite, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, belongs to
the tetragonal system, and the planes of its pyramid are inclined at an angle of about
118°, whilst magnetic iron ore, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which resembles hausmannite in many respects,
appears in regular octahedra&mdash;that is, the pyramidal planes are inclined at an angle of
109° 28&#8242;. This is an example of paramorphism; the systems are different, the compositions
are analogous, and there is a certain resemblance in form. Hemimorphism has
been found in many instances of saline and other substitutions. Thus, Laurent demonstrated,
and Hintze confirmed (1873), that naphthalene derivatives of analogous composition
are hemimorphous. Nicklès (1849) showed that in ethylene sulphate the angle of
the prism is 125° 26&#8242;, and in the nitrate of the same radicle 126° 95&#8242;. The angle of the
prism of methylamine oxalate is 131° 20&#8242;, and of fluoride, which is very different in composition
from the former, the angle is 132°. Groth (1870) endeavoured to indicate in
general what kinds of change of form proceed with the substitution of hydrogen by
various other elements and groups, and he observed a regularity which he termed
<i>morphotropy</i>. The following examples show that morphotropy recalls the hemimorphism
of Laurent. Benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, rhombic system, ratio of the axes 0·891 : 1 : 0·799. Phenol,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH), and resorcinol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, also rhombic system, but the ratio of one axis is
changed&mdash;thus, in resorcinol, 0·910 : 1 : 0·540; that is, a portion of the crystalline structure
in one direction is the same, but in the other direction it is changed, whilst in the
rhombic system dinitrophenol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH) = O·833 : 1 : 0·753; trinitrophenol (picric
acid), C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(NO)<sub>3</sub>(OH) = 0·937 : 1 : 0·974; and the potassium salt = 0·942 : 1 : 1·354.
Here the ratio of the first axis is preserved&mdash;that is, certain angles remain constant,
and the chemical proximity of the composition of these bodies is undoubted. Laurent
compares hemimorphism with architectural style. Thus, Gothic cathedrals differ in many
respects, but there is an analogy expressed both in the sum total of their common
relations and in certain details&mdash;for example, in the windows. It is evident that we may
expect many fruitful results for molecular mechanics (which forms a problem common to
many provinces of natural science) from the further elaboration of the data concerning
those variations which take place in crystalline form when the composition of a substance
is subjected to a known change, and therefore I consider it useful to point out to the
student of science seeking for matter for independent scientific research this vast field for
work which is presented by the correlation of form and composition. The geometrical regularity
and varied beauty of crystalline forms offer no small attraction to research of this kind.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_8" id="Footnote_6_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_8"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The still more complex combinations&mdash;which are so clearly expressed in the
crystallo-hydrates, double salts, and similar compounds&mdash;although they may be regarded
as independent, are, however, most easily understood with our present knowledge
as aggregations of whole molecules to which there are no corresponding double compounds,
containing one atom of an element R and many atoms of other elements RX<sub><i>n</i></sub>.
The above types embrace all cases of direct combinations of atoms, and the formula
MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O cannot, without violating known facts, be directly deduced from the types
MgX<sub><i>n</i></sub> or SX<sub><i>n</i></sub>, whilst the formula MgSO<sub>4</sub> corresponds both with the type of the
magnesium compounds MgX<sub>2</sub> and with the type of the sulphur compounds SO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>, or in
general SX<sub>6</sub>, where X<sub>2</sub> is replaced by (OH)<sub>2</sub>, with the substitution in this case of H<sub>2</sub> by
the atom Mg, which always replaces H<sub>2</sub>. However, it must be remarked that the
sodium crystallo-hydrates often contain 10H<sub>2</sub>O, the magnesium crystallo-hydrates 6 and
7H<sub>2</sub>O, and that the type PtM<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> is proper to the double salts of platinum, &amp;c. With
the further development of our knowledge concerning crystallo-hydrates, double salts,
alloys, solutions, &amp;c., in the <i>chemical sense</i> of feeble compounds (that is, such as are
easily destroyed by feeble chemical influences) it will probably be possible to arrive at a
perfect generalisation for them. For a long time these subjects were only studied by the
way or by chance; our knowledge of them is accidental and destitute of system, and therefore
it is impossible to expect as yet any generalisation as to their nature. The days of
Gerhardt are not long past when only three types were recognised: RX, RX<sub>2</sub>, and RX<sub>3</sub>;
the type RX<sub>4</sub> was afterwards added (by Cooper, Kekulé, Butleroff, and others), mainly for
the purpose of generalising the data respecting the carbon compounds. And indeed many
are still satisfied with these types, and derive the higher types from them; for instance,
RX<sub>5</sub> from RX<sub>3</sub>&mdash;as, for example, POCl<sub>3</sub> from PCl<sub>3</sub>, considering the oxygen to be bound
both to the chlorine (as in HClO) and to the phosphorus. But the time has now arrived
when it is clearly seen that the forms RX, RX<sub>2</sub>, RX<sub>3</sub>, and RX<sub>4</sub> do not exhaust the whole
variety of phenomena. The revolution became evident when Würtz showed that PCl<sub>5</sub> is
not a compound of PCl<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> (although it may decompose into them), but a whole
molecule capable of passing into vapour, PCl<sub>5</sub> like PF<sub>5</sub> and SiF<sub>4</sub>. The time for the
recognition of types even higher than RX<sub>8</sub> is in my opinion in the future; that it will
come, we can already see in the fact that oxalic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, gives a crystallo-hydrate
with 2H<sub>2</sub>O; but it may be referred to the type CH<sub>4</sub>, or rather to the type of
ethane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, in which all the atoms of hydrogen are replaced by hydroxyl, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O
= C<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub> (<i>see</i> Chapter XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_35_445">35</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_9" id="Footnote_7_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_9"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The hydrogen compounds, R<sub>2</sub>H, in equivalency correspond with the type of the
suboxides, R<sub>4</sub>O. Palladium, sodium, and potassium give such hydrogen compounds,
and it is worthy of remark that according to the periodic system these elements stand
near to each other, and that in those groups where the hydrogen compounds R<sub>2</sub>H appear,
the quaternary oxides R<sub>4</sub>O are also present.</p>

<p>Not wishing to complicate the explanation, I here only touch on the general features
of the relation between the hydrates and oxides and of the oxides among themselves.
Thus, for instance, the conception of the ortho-acids and of the normal acids will be
considered in speaking of phosphoric and phosphorous acids.</p>

<p>As in the further explanation of the periodic law only those oxides which give salts
will be considered, I think it will not be superfluous to mention here the following facts
relative to the peroxides. Of the <i>peroxides</i> corresponding with hydrogen peroxide, the
following are at present known: H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (as HSO<sub>4</sub>?), K<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CaO<sub>2</sub>,
TiO<sub>3</sub>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, CuO<sub>2</sub>(?), ZnO<sub>2</sub>, Rb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, SrO<sub>2</sub>, Ag<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, CdO<sub>2</sub>, CsO<sub>2</sub>, Cs<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BaO<sub>2</sub>, Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,
SnO<sub>3</sub>, W<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, UO<sub>4</sub>. It is probable that the number of peroxides will increase with
further investigation. A periodicity is seen in those now known, for the elements
(excepting Li) of the first group, which give R<sub>2</sub>O, form peroxides, and then the elements
of the sixth group seem also to be particularly inclined to form peroxides, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>; but at
present it is too early, in my opinion, to enter upon a generalisation of this subject, not
only because it is a new and but little studied matter (not investigated for all the
elements), but also, and more especially, because in many instances only the hydrates
are known&mdash;for instance, Mo<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>&mdash;and they perhaps are only compounds of peroxide
of hydrogen&mdash;for example, Mo<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> = 2MoO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&mdash;since Prof. Schöne has shown that
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and BaO<sub>2</sub> possess the property of combining together and with other oxides.
Nevertheless, I have, in the general table expressing the periodic properties of the
elements, endeavoured to sum up the data respecting all the known peroxide compounds
whose characteristic property is seen in their capability to form peroxide of hydrogen
under many circumstances.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_10" id="Footnote_8_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_10"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The periodic law and the periodic system of the elements appeared in the same
form as here given in the first edition of this work, begun in 1868 and finished in 1871.
In laying out the accumulated information respecting the elements, I had occasion to
reflect on their mutual relations. At the beginning of 1869 I distributed among many
chemists a pamphlet entitled &lsquo;An Attempted System of the Elements, based on their
Atomic Weights and Chemical Analogies,&rsquo; and at the March meeting of the Russian
Chemical Society, 1869, I communicated a paper &lsquo;On the Correlation of the Properties and
Atomic Weights of the Elements.&rsquo; The substance of this paper is embraced in the following
conclusions: (1) The elements, if arranged according to their atomic weights, exhibit an
evident <i>periodicity</i> of properties. (2) Elements which are similar as regards their
chemical properties have atomic weights which are either of nearly the same value
(platinum, iridium, osmium) or which increase regularly (<i>e.g.</i> potassium, rubidium, cæsium).
(3) The arrangement of the elements or of groups of elements in the order of their
atomic weights corresponds with their so-called <i>valencies</i>. (4) The elements, which are
the most widely distributed in nature, have <i>small</i> atomic weights, and all the elements
of small atomic weight are characterised by sharply defined properties. They are
therefore typical elements. (5) The <i>magnitude</i> of the atomic weight determines the
character of an element. (6) The discovery of many yet unknown elements may be
expected. For instance, elements analogous to aluminium and silicon, whose atomic
weights would be between 65 and 75. (7) The atomic weight of an element may sometimes
be corrected by aid of a knowledge of those of the adjacent elements. Thus
the combining weight of tellurium must lie between 123 and 126, and cannot be 128.
(8) Certain characteristic properties of the elements can be foretold from their atomic
weights.</p>

<p>The entire periodic law is included in these lines. In the series of subsequent papers
(1870&ndash;72, for example, in the <i>Transactions</i> of the Russian Chemical Society, of the
Moscow Meeting of Naturalists, of the St. Petersburg Academy, and Liebig's <i>Annalen</i>) on
the same subject we only find applications of the same principles, which were afterwards
confirmed by the labours of Roscoe, Carnelley, Thorpe, and others in England; of Rammelsberg
(cerium and uranium), L. Meyer (the specific volumes of the elements),
Zimmermann (uranium), and more especially of C. Winkler (who discovered germanium,
and showed its identity with ekasilicon), and others in Germany; of Lecoq de Boisbaudran
in France (the discoverer of gallium = ekaaluminium); of Clève (the atomic
weights of the cerium metals), Nilson (discoverer of scandium = ekaboron), and Nilson
and Pettersson (determination of the vapour density of beryllium chloride) in Sweden;
and of Brauner (who investigated cerium, and determined the combining weight of
tellurium = 125) in Austria, and Piccini in Italy.</p>

<p>I consider it necessary to state that, in arranging the periodic system of the elements,
I made use of the previous researches of Dumas, Gladstone, Pettenkofer, Kremers, and
Lenssen on the atomic weights of related elements, but I was not acquainted with the
works preceding mine of De Chancourtois (<i>vis tellurique</i>, or the spiral of the elements
according to their properties and equivalents) in France, and of J. Newlands (Law of
Octaves&mdash;for instance, H, F, Cl, Co, Br, Pd, I, Pt form the first octave, and O, S, Fe,
Se, Rh, Te, Au, Th the last) in England, although certain germs of the periodic law are
to be seen in these works. With regard to the work of Prof. Lothar Meyer respecting
the periodic law (Notes <a href="#Footnote_12_15">12</a> and <a href="#Footnote_13_17">13</a>), it is evident, judging from the method of investigation,
and from his statement (Liebig's <i>Annalen, Supt. Band 7</i>, 1870, 354), at the very
commencement of which he cites my paper of 1869 above mentioned, that he accepted
the periodic law in the form which I proposed.</p>

<p>In concluding this historical statement I consider it well to observe that no law
of nature, however general, has been established all at once; its recognition is always
preceded by many hints; the establishment of a law, however, does not take place when
its significance is recognised, but only when it has been confirmed by experiment, which
the man of science must consider as the only proof of the correctness of his conjectures
and opinions. I therefore, for my part, look upon Roscoe, De Boisbaudran, Nilson,
Winkler, Brauner, Carnelley, Thorpe, and others who verified the adaptability of the
periodic law to chemical facts, as the true founders of the periodic law, the further development
of which still awaits fresh workers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_11" id="Footnote_9_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_11"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> This resembles the fact, well known to those having an acquaintance with organic
chemistry, that in a series of homologues (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_338">VIII.</a>) the first members, in which
there is the least carbon, although showing the general properties of the homologous
series, still present certain distinct peculiarities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_12" id="Footnote_10_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_12"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Besides arranging the elements (<i>a</i>) in a successive order according to their atomic
weights, with indication of their analogies by showing some of the properties&mdash;for
instance, their power of giving one or another form of combination&mdash;both of the <i>elements</i>
and of their compounds (as is done in <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a> and in the table on p. <a href="#Page_36">36</a>), (<i>b</i>) according
to periods (as in Table I. at the commencement of volume I. after the preface),
and (<i>c</i>) according to groups and series or small periods (as in the same tables), I am
acquainted with the following methods of expressing the periodic relations of the elements:
(1) By a curve drawn through points obtained in the following manner: The elements
are arranged along the horizontal axis as abscissæ at distances from zero proportional to
their atomic weights, whilst the values for all the elements of some property&mdash;for example,
the specific volumes or the melting points, are expressed by the ordinates. This method,
although graphic, has the theoretical disadvantage that it does not in any way indicate
the existence of a limited and definite number of elements in each period. There is
nothing, for instance, in this method of expressing the law of periodicity to show that
between magnesium and aluminium there can be no other element with an atomic weight
of, say, 25, atomic volume 13, and in general having properties intermediate between those
of these two elements. The actual periodic law does not correspond with a continuous
change of properties, with a continuous variation of atomic weight&mdash;in a word, it does
not express an uninterrupted function&mdash;and as the law is purely chemical, starting from
the conception of atoms and molecules which combine in multiple proportions, with
intervals (not continuously), it <i>above all</i> depends on there being but few types of compounds,
which are arithmetically simple, <i>repeat themselves</i>, and offer no uninterrupted
transitions, so that each period can only contain a definite number of members.
For this reason there can be no other elements between magnesium, which gives the
chloride MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and aluminium, which forms AlX<sub>3</sub>; there is a break in the continuity,
according to the law of multiple proportions. The periodic law ought not, therefore, to
be expressed by geometrical figures in which continuity is always understood. Owing to
these considerations I never have and never will express the periodic relations of the
elements by any geometrical figures. (2) <i>By a plane spiral.</i> Radii are traced from a
centre, proportional to the atomic weights; analogous elements lie along one radius, and
the points of intersection are arranged in a spiral. This method, adopted by De
Chancourtois, Baumgauer, E. Huth, and others, has many of the imperfections of the
preceding, although it removes the indefiniteness as to the number of elements in a period.
It is merely an attempt to reduce the complex relations to a simple graphic representation,
since the equation to the spiral and the number of radii are not dependent upon
anything. (3) <i>By the lines of atomicity</i>, either parallel, as in Reynolds's and the Rev.
S. Haughton's method, or as in Crookes's method, arranged to the right and left of an
axis, along which the magnitudes of the atomic weights are counted, and the position
of the elements marked off, on the one side the members of the even series (paramagnetic,
like oxygen, potassium, iron), and on the other side the members of the
uneven series (diamagnetic, like sulphur, chlorine, zinc, and mercury). On joining up
these points a periodic curve is obtained, compared by Crookes to the oscillations of a
pendulum, and, according to Haughton, representing a cubical curve. This method
would be very graphic did it not require, for instance, that sulphur should be considered
as bivalent and manganese as univalent, although neither of these elements gives
stable derivatives of these natures, and although the one is taken on the basis of the
lowest possible compound SX<sub>2</sub>, and the other of the highest, because manganese can be
referred to the univalent elements only by the analogy of KMnO<sub>4</sub> to KClO<sub>4</sub>. Furthermore,
Reynolds and Crookes place hydrogen, iron, nickel, cobalt, and others outside the
axis of atomicity, and consider uranium as bivalent without the least foundation. (4)
Rantsheff endeavoured to classify the elements in their periodic relations by a system
dependent on solid geometry. He communicated this mode of expression to the Russian
Chemical Society, but his communication, which is apparently not void of interest,
has not yet appeared in print. (5) <i>By algebraic formulæ</i>: for example, E. J. Mills
(1886) endeavours to express all the atomic weights by the logarithmic function
A = 15(<i>n</i> - 0·9375<i>t</i>), in which the variables <i>n</i> and <i>t</i> are whole numbers. For instance, for
oxygen <i>n</i>=2, <i>t</i>=1; hence A = 15·94; for antimony <i>n</i>=9, <i>t</i>=0; whence A=120, and so on.
<i>n</i> varies from 1 to 16 and <i>t</i> from 0 to 59. The analogues are hardly distinguishable by
this method: thus for chlorine the magnitudes of <i>n</i> and <i>t</i> are 3 and 7; for bromine 6 and 6;
for iodine 9 and 9; for potassium 3 and 14; for rubidium 6 and 18; for cæsium 9 and 20;
but a certain regularity seems to be shown. (6) A more natural method of expressing
the dependence of the properties of elements on their atomic weights is obtained by
<i>trigonometrical functions</i>, because this dependence is periodic like the functions of trigonometrical
lines, and therefore Ridberg in Sweden (Lund, 1885) and F. Flavitzky in Russia
(Kazan, 1887) have adopted a similar method of expression, which must be considered
as worthy of being worked out, although it does not express the absence of intermediate
elements&mdash;for instance, between magnesium and aluminium, which is essentially the
most important part of the matter. (7) The investigations of B. N. Tchitchérin (1888,
<i>Journal of the Russian Physical and Chemical Society</i>) form the first effort in the
latter direction. He carefully studied the alkali metals, and discovered the following
simple relation between their atomic volumes: they can all be expressed by A(2 - 0·0428A<i>n</i>),
where A is the atomic weight and <i>n</i> = 1 for lithium and sodium, <sup>4</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> for potassium, &#8540; for
rubidium, and <sup>2</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> for cæsium. If <i>n</i> always = 1, then the volume of the atom would
become zero at A = 46&#8532;, and would reach its maximum when A = 23&#8531;, and the density
increases with the growth of A. In order to explain the variation of <i>n</i>, and the relation of
the atomic weights of the alkali metals to those of the other elements, as also the atomicity
itself, Tchitchérin supposes all atoms to be built up of a primary matter; he considers
the relation of the central to the peripheric mass, and, guided by mechanical principles,
deduces many of the properties of the atoms from the reaction of the internal and
peripheric parts of each atom. This endeavour offers many interesting points, but it
admits the hypothesis of the building up of all the elements from one primary matter,
and at the present time such an hypothesis has not the least support either in theory or
in fact. Besides which the starting-point of the theory is the specific gravity of the
metals at a definite temperature (it is not known how the above relation would appear
at other temperatures), and the specific gravity varies even under mechanical influences.
L. Hugo (1884) endeavoured to represent the atomic weights of Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs
by geometrical figures&mdash;for instance, Li = 7 represents a central atom = 1 and six atoms on
the six terminals of an octahedron; Na, is obtained by applying two such atoms on each
edge of an octahedron, and so on. It is evident that such methods can add nothing new
to our data respecting the atomic weights of analogous elements.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_13" id="Footnote_11_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_13"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Many natural phenomena exhibit a dependence of a periodic character. Thus the
phenomena of day and night and of the seasons of the year, and vibrations of all kinds,
exhibit variations of a periodic character in dependence on time and space. But in
ordinary periodic functions one variable varies continuously, whilst the other increases
to a limit, then a period of decrease begins, and having in turn reached its limit a period
of increase again begins. It is otherwise in the periodic function of the elements. Here
the mass of the elements does not increase continuously, but abruptly, by steps, as from
magnesium to aluminium. So also the valency or atomicity leaps directly from 1 to 2 to
3, &amp;c., without intermediate quantities, and in my opinion it is these properties which
are the most important, and it is their periodicity which forms the substance of the
periodic law. It expresses <i>the properties of the real elements</i>, and not of what may be
termed their manifestations visually known to us. The external properties of elements
and compounds are in periodic dependence on the atomic weight of the elements only
because these external properties are themselves the result of the properties of the real elements
which unite to form the &lsquo;free&rsquo; elements and the compounds. To explain and express
the periodic law is to explain and express the cause of the law of multiple proportions, of
the difference of the elements, and the variation of their atomicity, and at the same time
to understand what mass and gravitation are. In my opinion this is still premature. But
just as without knowing the cause of gravitation it is possible to make use of the law of
gravity, so for the aims of chemistry it is possible to take advantage of the laws discovered
by chemistry without being able to explain their causes. The above-mentioned peculiarity
of the laws of chemistry respecting definite compounds and the atomic weights
leads one to think that the time has not yet come for their full explanation, and I do not
think that it will come before the explanation of such a primary law of nature as the law
of gravity.</p>

<p>It will not be out of place here to turn our attention to the many-sided correlation
existing between the undecomposable <i>elements and the compound carbon radicles</i>,
which has long been remarked (Pettenkofer, Dumas, and others), and reconsidered in
recent times by Carnelley (1886), and most originally in Pelopidas's work (1883) on the
principles of the periodic system. Pelopidas compares the series containing eight hydrocarbon
radicles, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+1</sub>, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub> &amp;c., for instance, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>13</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>11</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>,  C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>9</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>, and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>&mdash;with the series of the elements arranged in eight groups. The analogy
is particularly clear owing to the property of C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+1</sub> to combine with X, thus reaching
saturation, and of the following members with X<sub>2</sub>, X<sub>3</sub> &hellip; X<sub>8</sub>, and especially because these
are followed by an aromatic radicle&mdash;for example, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&mdash;in which, as is well known, many
of the properties of the saturated radicle C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>13</sub> are repeated, and in particular the power
of forming a univalent radicle again appears. Pelopidas shows a confirmation of the
parallel in the property of the above radicles of giving oxygen compounds corresponding
with the groups in the periodic system. Thus the hydrocarbon radicles of the first group&mdash;for
instance, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>13</sub> or C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&mdash;give oxides of the form R<sub>2</sub>O and hydroxides RHO, like the
metals of the alkalis; and in the third group they form oxides R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and hydrates RO<sub>2</sub>H.
For example, in the series CH<sub>3</sub> the corresponding compounds of the third group will be the
oxide (CH)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, formic anhydride and hydrate, CHO<sub>2</sub>H, or formic acid.
In the sixth group, with a composition of C<sub>2</sub>, the oxide RO<sub>3</sub> will be C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and hydrate
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&mdash;that is, also a bibasic acid (oxalic) resembling sulphuric, among the inorganic
acids. After applying his views to a number of organic compounds, Pelopidas dwells
more particularly on the radicles corresponding with ammonium.</p>

<p>With respect to this remarkable parallelism, it must above all be observed that in the
elements the atomic weight increases in passing to contiguous members of a higher
valency, whilst here it decreases, which should indicate that the periodic variability of
elements and compounds is subject to some higher law whose nature, and still more
whose cause, cannot at present be determined. It is probably based on the fundamental
principles of the internal mechanics of the atoms and molecules, and as the periodic law
has only been generally recognised for a few years it is not surprising that any further
progress towards its explanation can only be looked for in the development of facts
touching on this subject.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_BIS_14" id="Footnote_11_BIS_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_BIS_14"><span class="label">[11 bis]</span></a> True peroxides (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_7_9">7</a>), like H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BaO<sub>2</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (Chapter <a href="#Page_200">XX.</a>), must not be
confused with true saline oxides even if the latter contain much oxygen (for instance,
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, CrO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.) although one and the other easily oxidise. The difference between them
is seen in their fundamental properties: the saline oxides correspond to water, while the
peroxides correspond in their reactions and origin to peroxide of hydrogen. This is
clearly seen in the difference between Na<sub>2</sub>O and Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_513">XII.</a>). Therefore the
peroxides should also have their periodicity. An element R, giving a highest degree of
oxidation, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub><i>n</i></sub>, may give both a lower degree of oxidation, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub><i>n</i>-<i>m</i></sub> (where <i>m</i> is evidently
less than <i>n</i>), and peroxides, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub><i>n</i>+1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub><i>n</i>+2</sub>, or even more oxygen. This class of oxides,
to which attention has only recently been turned (Berthelot, Piccini, &amp;c.), may perhaps
on further study give the possibility of generalising the capability of the elements to give
unstable complex higher forms of combination, such as double salts, and in my opinion
should in the near future be the field of new and important discoveries. And in contemporary
chemistry, salts, saline oxides, hydrogen compounds, and other combinations of
the elements corresponding to them constitute an important and very complex problem
for generalisation, which is satisfied by the periodic law in its present form, to which it
has risen from its first state, in which it gave the means of foreseeing (<i>see</i> later on) the
existence of unknown elements (Ga, Sc, and Ge), their properties, and many details
respecting their compounds. Until those improvements in the periodic system which
have been proposed by Prof. Flavitzky (of Kazan) and Prof. Harperath (of Cordoba, in
the Argentine Republic), Ugo Alvisi (Italy), and others give similar practical results, I
think it unnecessary to discuss them further.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_15" id="Footnote_12_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_15"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The hydrides generalised by the periodic law are those to which metallo-organic
compounds correspond, and they are themselves either volatile or gaseous. The hydrogen
compounds like Na<sub>2</sub>H, BaH, &amp;c. are distinguished by other signs. They resemble
alloys. They show (<i>see</i> end of last chapter) a systematic harmony, but they evidently
should not be confused with true hydrides, any more than peroxides with saline oxides.
Moreover, such hydrides have, like the peroxides, only recently been subjected to
research, and have been but little studied. The best known of these compounds are
given in the 16th column of <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a>, and it will be seen that they already exhibit a

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_BIS_16" id="Footnote_12_BIS_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_BIS_16"><span class="label">[12 bis]</span></a> The relation between the atomic weights, and especially the difference = 16, was
observed in the sixth and seventh decades of this century by Dumas, Pettenkofer, L. Meyer,
and others. Thus Lothar Meyer in 1864, following Dumas and others, grouped together
the tetravalent elements carbon and silicon; the trivalent elements nitrogen, phosphorus,
arsenic, antimony, and bismuth; the bivalent oxygen, sulphur, selenium, and tellurium;
the univalent fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine; the univalent metals lithium,
sodium, potassium, rubidium, cæsium, and thallium, and the bivalent metals beryllium,
magnesium, strontium and barium&mdash;observing that in the first the difference is, in general
= 16, in the second about = 46, and the last about = 87&ndash;90. The first germs of the periodic
law are visible in such observations as these. Since its establishment this subject has been
most fully worked out by Ridberg (Note <a href="#Footnote_10_12">10</a>), who observed a periodicity in the variation of
the differences between the atomic weights of two contiguous elements, and its relation to
their atomicity. A. Bazaroff (1887) investigated the same subject, taking, not the arithmetical
differences of contiguous and analogous elements, but the ratio of their atomic
weights; and he also observed that this ratio alternately rises and falls with the rise of
the atomic weights. I will here remark that the relation of the eighth group to the others
will be considered at the end of this work in Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII.</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_17" id="Footnote_13_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_17"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The laws of nature admit of no exceptions, and in this they clearly differ from
such rules and maxims as are found in grammar, and other inventions, methods, and
relations of man's creation. The confirmation of a law is only possible by deducing
consequences from it, such as could not possibly be foreseen without it, and by verifying
those consequences by experiment and further proofs. Therefore, when I conceived the
periodic law, I (1869&ndash;1871, Note <a href="#Footnote_9_11">9</a>) deduced such logical consequences from it as could
serve to show whether it were true or not. Among them was the prediction of the
properties of undiscovered elements and the correction of the atomic weights of many,
and at that time little known, elements. Thus uranium was considered as trivalent,
U = 120; but as such it did not correspond with the periodic law. I therefore proposed to
double its atomic weight&mdash;U = 240, and the researches of Roscoe, Zimmermann, and others
justified this alteration (Chapter <a href="#Page_276">XXI.</a>). It was the same with cerium (Chapter <a href="#Page_99">XVIII.</a>)
whose atomic weight it was necessary to change according to the periodic law. I therefore
determined its specific heat, and the result I obtained was verified by the new determinations
of Hillebrand. I then corrected certain formulæ of the cerium compounds,
and the researches of Rammelsberg, Brauner, Clève, and others verified the proposed
alteration. It was necessary to do one or the other&mdash;either to consider the periodic law
as completely true, and as forming a new instrument in chemical research, or to refute it.
Acknowledging the method of experiment to be the only true one, I myself verified what
I could, and gave every one the possibility of proving or confirming the law, and did not
think, like L. Meyer (Liebig's <i>Annalen, Supt. Band 7</i>, 1870, 364), when writing about the
periodic law that &lsquo;it would be rash to change the accepted atomic weights on the basis of
so uncertain a starting-point.&rsquo;  (&lsquo;Es  würde  voreilig  sein, auf so unsichere Anhaltspunkte
hin eine Aenderung der bisher angenommenen Atomgewichte vorzunehmen.&rsquo;) In my
opinion, the basis offered by the periodic law had to be verified or refuted, and experiment
in every case verified it. The starting-point then became general. No law of nature can
be established without such a method of testing it. Neither De Chancourtois, to whom
the French ascribe the discovery of the periodic law, nor Newlands, who is put forward by
the English, nor L. Meyer, who is now cited by many as its founder, ventured to foretell
the <i>properties</i> of undiscovered elements, or to alter the &lsquo;accepted atomic weights,&rsquo; or, in
general, to regard the periodic law as a new, strictly established law of nature, as I did
from the very beginning (1869).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_18" id="Footnote_14_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_18"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> When in 1871 I wrote a paper on the application of the periodic law to the determination
of the properties of hitherto undiscovered elements, I did not think I should live
to see the verification of this consequence of the law, but such was to be the case. Three
elements were described&mdash;ekaboron, ekaaluminium, and ekasilicon&mdash;and now, after the
lapse of twenty years, I have had the great pleasure of seeing them discovered and
named Gallium, Scandium, and Germanium, after those three countries where the rare
minerals containing them are found, and where they were discovered. For my part I
regard L. de Boisbaudran, Nilson, and Winkler, who discovered these elements, as the true
corroborators of the periodic law. Without them it would not have been accepted to the
extent it now is.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_19" id="Footnote_15_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_19"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Taking indium, which occurs together with zinc, as our example, we will show the
principle of the method employed. The equivalent of indium to hydrogen in its oxide is
37·7&mdash;that is, if we suppose its composition to be like that of water; then In = 37·7, and
the oxide of indium is In<sub>2</sub>O. The atomic weight of indium was taken as double the equivalent&mdash;that
is, indium was considered to be a bivalent element&mdash;and In = 2 × 37·7 = 75·4.
If indium only formed an oxide, RO, it should be placed in group II. But in this
case it appears that there would be no place for indium in the system of the elements,
because the positions II., 5 = Zn = 65 and II., 6 = Sr = 87 were already occupied by
known elements, and according to the periodic law an element with an atomic weight 75
could not be bivalent. As neither the vapour density nor the specific heat, nor even the
isomorphism (the salts of indium crystallise with great difficulty) of the compounds of
indium were known, there was no reason for considering it to be a bivalent metal, and
therefore it might be regarded as trivalent, quadrivalent, &amp;c. If it be trivalent, then
In = 3 × 37·7 = 113, and the composition of the oxide is In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and of its salts InX<sub>3</sub>. In
this case it at once falls into its place in the system, namely, in group III. and 7th
series, between Cd = 112 and Sn = 118, as an analogue of aluminium or dvialuminium
(dvi = 2 in Sanskrit). All the properties observed in indium correspond with this
position; for example, the density, cadmium = 8·6, indium = 7·4, tin = 7·2; the basic
properties of the oxides CdO, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, successively vary, so that the properties of
In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are intermediate between those of CdO and SnO<sub>2</sub> or Cd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. That
indium belongs to group III. has been confirmed by the determination of its specific heat,
(0·057 according to Bunsen, and 0·055 according to me) and also by the fact that indium
forms alums like aluminium, and therefore belongs to the same group.</p>

<p>The same kind of considerations necessitated taking the atomic weight of titanium
as nearly 48, and not as 52, the figure derived from many analyses. And both these
corrections, made on the basis of the law, have now been confirmed, for Thorpe found, by
a series of careful experiments, the atomic weight of titanium to be that foreseen by the
periodic law. Notwithstanding that previous analyses gave Os = 199·7, Ir = 198, and
Pt = 187, the periodic law shows, as I remarked in 1871, that the atomic weights should
rise from osmium to platinum and gold, and not fall. Many recent researches, and
especially those of Seubert, have fully verified this statement, based on the law. Thus a
true law of nature anticipates facts, foretells magnitudes, gives a hold on nature, and
leads to improvements in the methods of research, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_20" id="Footnote_16_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_20"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Meyer, Willgerodt, and others, guided by the fact that Gustavson and Friedel had
remarked that metalepsis rapidly proceeds in the presence of aluminium, investigated
the action of nearly all the elements in this respect. For example, they took benzene,
added the metals to be experimented on to it, and passed chlorine through the liquid in
diffused light. When, for instance, sodium, potassium, barium, &amp;c. are taken, there is
no action on the benzene; that is, hydrochloric acid is not disengaged; but if aluminium,
gold, or, in general, any metal having this power of aiding chlorination (Halogen-überträger)
is employed, then the action is clearly seen from the volumes of hydrochloric
acid evolved (especially if the metallic chloride formed is soluble in benzene).
Thus, in group I., and in general among the even and light elements, there are none
capable of serving as agents of metalepsis; but aluminium, gallium, indium, antimony,
tellurium, and iodine, which are contiguous members in the periodic system, are excellent
transmitters (carriers) of the halogens.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_21" id="Footnote_17_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_21"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The periodic relations enumerated above appertain to the real elements, and not
to the elements in the free state as we know them; and it is very important to note
this, because the periodic law refers to the real elements, inasmuch as the atomic weight
is proper to the real element, and not to the &lsquo;free&rsquo; element, to which, as to a compound,
a molecular weight is proper. Physical properties are chiefly determined by the
properties of molecules, and only indirectly depend on the properties of the atoms forming
the molecules. For this reason the periods, which are clearly and quite distinctly
expressed&mdash;for instance, in the forms of combination&mdash;become to some extent involved
(complicated) in the physical properties of their members. Thus, for instance, besides
the <i>maxima</i> and <i>minima</i> corresponding with the periods and groups, new molecules
appear; thus, as regards the melting-point of germanium, a local maximum appears,
which was, however, foreseen by the periodic law when the properties of germanium
(ekasilicon) were forecast.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_BIS_22" id="Footnote_17_BIS_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_BIS_22"><span class="label">[17 bis]</span></a> The relation of certain elements (for instance, the analogues of Pt) among
diamagnetic and paramagnetic bodies is sometimes doubtful (probably partly owing to
the imperfect purity of the reagents under investigation). This subject has been studied
in some detail by Bachmetieff in 1889.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_23" id="Footnote_18_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_23"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> It is evident that many of the figures, especially those exceeding 1000°, have been
determined with but little exactitude, and some, placed in <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a> with the sign (?), I
have only given on the basis of rough and comparative determinations, calculated from
the melting-points of silver and platinum, now established by many observers. In
<a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a>, besides the large periods whose maxima correspond with carbon, silicon,
titanium, ruthenium (?), and osmium (?), there are also small periods in the melting-points,
and their maxima correspond with sulphur, arsenic, antimony. The minima
correspond with the halogens and metals of the alkalis. A distinct periodicity is also
seen in taking the coefficients of linear expansion (chiefly according to Fizeau); for
instance, in the vertical series (according to the magnitude of the atomic weight), Fe,
Co, Ni, Cu, the linear expansion in millionths of an inch = 12, 13, 17, and 29; for Rh,
Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, and Sb the coefficients are 8, 12, 19, 31, 46, 26, and 12, so that a
maximum is reached at In. In the series Ir (7), Pt (5), Au (14), Hg (60), Tl (31), Pb (29),
and Bi (14), the maximum is at Hg and the minimum at Pt. Raoul Pictet expressed
this connection by the fact that he found the product &#945;(<i>t</i> + 273)&#8731;(A/<i>d</i>) to be nearly
constant for all elements in the free state, and nearly equal to 0·045, and being the coefficient
of linear expansion, <i>t</i> + 273, the melting-point calculated from the absolute zero
(-273°), and &#8731;(A/<i>d</i>), the mean distance between the atoms, if A is the atomic weight and
<i>d</i> the sp. gr. of an element. Although the above product is not strictly constant, nevertheless
Pictet's rule gives an idea of the bond between magnitudes which ought to have
a certain connection with each other. De Heen, Nadeschdin, and others also studied
this dependence, but their deductions do not give a general and exact law.</p></div>

<p>Laurie (1882) also observed a periodicity in the <i>quantity of heat</i> developed in the
formation of the chlorides, bromides, and iodides (fig. <a href="#fig_79">79</a>), as is seen from the following
figures, where the heat developed is expressed in thousands of calories, and referred to a
molecule of chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, so that the heat of formation of KCl is doubled, and that of
SnCl<sub>4</sub> halved, &amp;c.: Na 195 (Ag 59, Au 12), Mg 151 (Zn 97, Cd 93, Hg 63), Al 117, Si 79
(Sn 64), K 211 (Li 187), Ca 170 (Sr 185, Ba 194), whence it is seen that the greatest
amount of heat is evolved by the metals of the alkalis, and that in each period it
falls from them to the halogens, which evolve very little heat in combining together.
Richardson, by comparing the heats of formation of the fluorides also came to the
conclusion that they are in periodic dependence upon the atomic weights of the combined
elements.</p>

I have employed above, observed a correlation in the calorific equivalents of analogous
elements, although he did not remark their periodic variation; (2) that the uniformity
of many thermochemical deductions must gain considerably by the application of the
periodic law, which evidently repeats itself in calorimetric data; and if these data frequently
lead to true forecasts, this is due to the periodicity of the thermal as well as of
many other properties, as Laurie remarked; and (3) that the heat of formation of the
oxides is also subject to a periodic dependence which differs from that of the heat of
formation of the chlorides, in that the greatest quantity corresponds with the bivalent
metals of the alkaline earths (magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium), and not with the
univalent metals of the alkalis, as is the case with chlorine, bromine, and iodine. This
circumstance is probably connected with the fact that chlorine, bromine, and iodine are
univalent elements, and oxygen bivalent (compare, for instance, Chapter XI., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_13_634">13</a>,
Chapter XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_40_451">40</a>, Chapter XXIV., Note <a href="#Footnote_28_BIS_519">28</a><sup>bis</sup>, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>Keyser (1892), in investigating the spectra of the alkali metals and metals of the
alkaline earths, came to the conclusion that in this respect also there is a regularity of
a periodic character in dependence upon the atomic weights. Probably a closer and
systematic study of many of the properties of the elements and of complex and simple
bodies formed by them will more and more frequently lead to similar conclusions, and to
extending the range of application of the periodic law.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_BIS_25" id="Footnote_19_BIS_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_BIS_25"><span class="label">[19 bis]</span></a> Probably, besides thermo-chemical data (Note <a href="#Footnote_19_24">19</a>), the refractive index, cohesion,
ductility, and similar properties of corresponding compounds or of the elements themselves
will be found to exhibit a dependence of the magnitude of the atomic weight upon
the periodic law.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_26" id="Footnote_20_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_26"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Having occupied myself since the fifties (my dissertation for the degree of M.A.
concerned the specific volumes, and is printed in part in the <i>Russian Mining Journal</i>
for 1856) with the problems concerning the relations between the specific gravities and
volumes, and the chemical compositions of substances, I am inclined to think that the
direct investigation of specific gravities gives essentially the same results as the
investigation of specific volumes, only that the latter are more graphic. <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a> of
the periodic properties of the elements clearly illustrates this. Thus, for those members
whose volume is the greatest among the contiguous elements, the specific gravity is least&mdash;that
is, the periodic variation of both properties is equally evident. In passing, for
instance, from silver to iodine we have a successive decrease of specific gravity and successive
increase of specific volume. The periodic alternation of the rise and fall of the
specific gravity and specific volume of the free elements was communicated by me in
August 1869 to the Moscow Meeting of Russian Naturalists. In the following year (1870)
L. Meyer's paper appeared, which also dealt with the specific volume of the elements.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_27" id="Footnote_21_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_27"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> In my opinion the mean volume of the atoms of compounds deserves more attention
than has yet been paid to it. I may point out, for instance, that for feebly energetic
oxides the mean volume of the atom is generally nearly 7; for example, the oxides SiO<sub>2</sub>,
Sc<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, as well as ZnO, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, GeO<sub>2</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, &amp;c., whilst
the mean volume of the atom of the alkali and acid oxides is greater than 7. Thus we
find in the magnitudes of the mean volumes of the atom in oxides and salts both a
periodic variation and a connection with their energy of essentially the same character
as occurs in the case of the free elements.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_28" id="Footnote_22_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_28"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The volume of oxygen (judging by the table on p. <a href="#Page_36">36</a>) is evidently a variable quantity,
forming a distinctly periodic function of the atomic weight and type of the oxide, and
therefore the efforts which were formerly made to find the volume of the atom of oxygen
in the volumes of its compounds may be considered to be futile. But since a distinct contraction
takes place in the formation of oxides, and the volume of an oxide is frequently
less than the volume in the free state of the element contained in it, it might be surmised
that the volume of oxygen in a free state is about 15, and therefore the specific gravity
of solid oxygen in a free state would be about O·9.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_29" id="Footnote_23_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_29"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> As an example we will take indium oxide, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Its sp. gr. and sp. vol. should be
the mean of those of cadmium oxide, Cd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and stannic oxide, Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, as indium stands
between cadmium and tin. Thus in the seventies it was already evident that the volume
of indium oxide should be about 38, and its sp. gr. about 7·2, which was confirmed by the
determinations of Nilson and Pettersson (7·179) made in 1880.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_30" id="Footnote_24_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_30"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> As the distance between, and the volumes of, the molecules and atoms of solids
and liquids certainly enter into the data for the solution of the problems of molecular
mechanics, which as yet have only been worked out to any extent for the gaseous state,
the study of the specific gravity of solids, and especially of liquids, has long had an extensive
literature. With respect to solids, however, a great difficulty is met with, owing
to the specific gravity varying not only with a change of isomeric state (for example, for
silica in the form of quartz = 2·65, and in tridymite = 2·2) but also directly under mechanical
pressure (for example, in a crystalline, cast, and forged metal), and even with
the extent to which they are powdered, &amp;c., which influences are imperceptible in liquids.
Compare Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_55_BIS_885">55</a><sup>bis</sup>.</p>

<p>Without going into further details, we may add to what has been said above that the
conception of specific volumes and atomic distances has formed the subject of a large
number of researches, but as yet it is only possible to lay down a few generalisations given
by Dumas, Kopp, and others, which are mentioned and amplified by me in my work cited
in Note <a href="#Footnote_20_26">20</a>, and in my memoirs on this subject.</p>

<p>1. Analogous compounds and their isomorphs have frequently approximately the same
molecular volumes.</p>

<p>2. Other compounds, analogous in their properties, exhibit molecular volumes which
increase with the molecular weight.</p>

<p>3. When a contraction takes place in combination in a gaseous state, then contraction
is in the majority of instances also to be observed in the solid or liquid state&mdash;that is,
the sum of the volumes of the reacting substances is greater than the volume of the
resultant substance or substances.</p>

<p>4. In decomposition the reverse takes place to that which occurs in combination.</p>

<p>5. In substitution (when the volumes in a state of vapour do not vary) a very small
change of volume generally takes place&mdash;that is, the sum of the volumes of the reacting
substances is almost equal to the sum of the resultant substances.</p>

<p>6. Hence it is impossible to judge the volume of the component substances from the
volume of a compound, although it is possible to do so from the product of substitution.</p>

<p>7. The replacement of H<sub>2</sub> by sodium, Na<sub>2</sub>, and by barium, Ba, as well as the replacement
of SO<sub>4</sub> by Cl<sub>2</sub>, scarcely changes the volume, but the volume increases with the
replacement of Na by K, and decreases with the replacement of H<sub>2</sub>, by Li<sub>2</sub> Cu, and Mg.</p>

<p>8. There is no need for comparing volumes in a solid and liquid state at the so-called
corresponding temperatures&mdash;that is at temperatures at which vapour tension
is equal in each case. The comparison of volumes at the ordinary temperature is sufficient
for finding a regularity in the relations of volumes (this deduction was developed
with particular detail by me in 1856).</p>

<p>9. Many investigators (Perseau, Schröder, Löwig, Playfair and Joule, Baudrimont,
Einhardt) have sought in vain for a multiple proportion in the specific volumes of solids
and liquids.</p>

<p>10. The truth of the above is seen very clearly in comparing the volumes of polymeric
substances. The volumes of their molecules are equal in a state of vapour, but are very
different in a solid and liquid state, as is seen from the close resemblance of the specific
gravities of polymeric substances. But as a rule the more complex polymerides are
denser than the simpler.</p>

<p>11. We know that the hydroxides of light metals have generally a smaller volume
than the metals, whilst that of magnesium hydroxide is considerably greater, which is
explained by the stability of the former and instability of the latter. In proof of this we
may cite, besides the volumes of the true alkali metals, the volume of barium (36) which
is greater than that of its stable hydroxide (sp. gr. 4·5, sp. vol. 30). The volumes of the
salts of magnesium and calcium are greater than the volume of the metal, with the
single exception of the fluoride of calcium. With the heavy metals the volume of the
compound is always greater than the volume of the metal, and, moreover, for such compounds
as silver iodide, AgI (<i>d</i> = 5·7), and mercuric iodide, HgI<sub>2</sub> (<i>d</i> = 6·2, and the volumes
of the compounds 41 and 73), the volume of the compound is greater than the sum of the
volumes of the component elements. Thus the sum of the volumes Ag + I = 36, and the
volume of AgI = 41. This stands out with particular clearness on comparing the volumes
K + I = 71 with the volume of KI, which is equal to 54, because its density = 3·06.</p>

<p>12. In such combinations, between solids and liquids, as solutions, alloys, isomorphous
mixtures, and similar feeble chemical compounds, the sum of the reacting substances is
always very nearly that of the resulting substance, but here the volume is either slightly
larger or smaller than the original; speaking generally, the amount of contraction
depends on the force of affinity acting between the combining substances. I may here
observe that the present data respecting the specific volumes of solid and liquid bodies
deserve a fresh and full elaboration to explain many contradictory statements which
have accumulated on this subject.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">ZINC, CADMIUM, AND MERCURY</span></h2>

<p>These three metals give, like magnesium, oxides RO, which form
feebly energetic bases, and like magnesium they are volatile. The
volatility increases with the atomic weight. Magnesium can be distilled
at a white heat, zinc at a temperature of about 930°, cadmium
about 770°, and mercury about 351°. Their oxides, RO, are more
easily reducible than magnesia, and mercuric oxide is the most easily
reducible. The properties of their salts RX<sub>2</sub> are very similar to
the properties of MgX<sub>2</sub>. Their solubility, power of forming double
and basic salts, and many other qualities are in many respects identical
with those of MgX<sub>2</sub>. The greater or less ease with which they are
oxidised, the instability of their compounds, the density of the metals
and their compounds, their scarcity in nature, and many other properties
gradually change with the increase of atomic weight, as might be
expected from the periodicity of the elements. Their principal characteristics,
as contrasted with magnesium, find a general expression in the
fact that zinc, cadmium, and mercury are heavy metals.</p>

<p><i>Zinc</i> stands nearest to magnesium in atomic weight and in properties.
Thus zinc sulphate, or white vitriol, easily crystallises with
seven molecules of water, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O. It is isomorphous with Epsom
salts, and parts with difficulty with the last molecule of water; it
forms double salts&mdash;for instance, ZnK<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;exactly as magnesium
sulphate does.<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>Zinc oxide</i>, ZnO, is a white powder, almost insoluble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in water,<a name="FNanchor_2_32" id="FNanchor_2_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_32" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> like magnesia, from which, however, it is distinguished
by its solubility in solutions of sodium and potassium hydroxides.<a name="FNanchor_3_33" id="FNanchor_3_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_33" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Zinc chloride<a name="FNanchor_4_34" id="FNanchor_4_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_34" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> is decomposed by water, combines with ammonium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>

an oxychloride, and also combines with zinc oxide.<a name="FNanchor_4_BIS_35" id="FNanchor_4_BIS_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_BIS_35" class="fnanchor">[4 bis]</a></p>

<p>Zinc, like many heavy metals, is often <i>found in nature in combination</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<i>with sulphur</i>, forming the so-called <i>zinc blende</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_36" id="FNanchor_5_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_36" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ZnS. It sometimes
occurs in large masses, often crystallised in cubes; it is frequently
translucent, and has a metallic lustre, although this is not so clearly
developed  as  in  many other metallic  sulphides with which we shall hereafter
become  acquainted. The ores of zinc also comprise the carbonate,
calamine, and silicate, <i>siliceous calamine</i>.</p>

crucible placed in a furnace. <i>o c</i>, tube along which the vapour passes and condenses.</p></div>

<p>Metallic zinc (spelter) is most frequently obtained from the ores
containing the carbonate<a name="FNanchor_6_37" id="FNanchor_6_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_37" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;that is, from calamine, which is sometimes
found in thick veins: for instance, in
Poland, Galicia, in some places on the
banks of the Rhine, and in considerable
masses in Belgium and England. In
Russia beds of zinc ore are met with in
Poland  and the Caucasus, but the output
is small. In Sweden, as early as the
fifteenth century, calamine was worked
up into an alloy of zinc and copper (brass),
and Paracelsus produced zinc from calamine;
but the technical production of the
metal itself, long ago practised in China,
only commenced in Europe in 1807&mdash;in
Belgium, when the Abbé Donnet discovered
that zinc was volatile. From that time
the production increased until it is now about 150 million kilograms in
Germany alone.</p>

<p>The reduction of metallic zinc from its ores is based on the fact that
zinc oxide<a name="FNanchor_7_38" id="FNanchor_7_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_38" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> is easily reduced by charcoal at a red heat: ZnO + C<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
= Zn + CO. The zinc thus obtained is in a finely divided state and
impure, being mixed with other metals reduced with it, but the greater
portion is <i>converted into vapour</i>, from which it easily passes into a
liquid or solid state. The reduction and distillation are carried on in
earthenware retorts, filled with a mixture of the divided ore and
charcoal. The vapours of zinc and gases formed during the reaction
escape by means of a pipe leading downwards, and are led to a chamber
where the vapours are cooled. By this means they do not come into
contact with the air, because the neck of the retort is filled with
gaseous carbonic oxide, and therefore the zinc does not oxidise; otherwise
its vapour would burn in the air.<a name="FNanchor_7_BIS_39" id="FNanchor_7_BIS_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_39" class="fnanchor">[7 bis]</a> The vapours of zinc, entering
into the cooling chamber, condense into white zinc powder or zinc
dust. When the neck of the retort is heated the zinc is obtained in
a liquid state, and is cast into plates, in which form it is generally
sold.</p>

<p>Commercial zinc is generally impure, containing a mixture of lead,
particles of carbon, iron, and other metals carried over with the vapours,
although they are not volatile at a temperature approaching 1000°. If
it be required to obtain pure zinc from the commercial article, it is subjected
to a further distillation in a crucible with a pipe passing through
the bottom, the vapours formed by the heated zinc only having exit
through the pipe cemented into the bottom of the crucible. Passing
through this pipe, the vapours condense to a liquid, which is collected
in a receiver. Zinc thus purified is generally re-melted and cast into
rods, and in this form is often used for physical and chemical researches
where a pure article is required.<a name="FNanchor_8_40" id="FNanchor_8_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_40" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Metallic zinc has a bluish-white colour; its lustre, compared with
many other metals, is insignificant. When cast it exhibits a crystalline
structure. Its specific gravity is about 7&mdash;that is, varies from 6·8
to 7·2, according to the degree of compression (by forging, rolling, &amp;c.)
to which it has been subjected. It is very ductile, considering its
hardness. For this reason it chokes up files when being worked. Its
malleability is considerable when pure, but in the ordinary impure condition
in which it is sold, it is impossible to roll it at the ordinary
temperature, as it easily breaks. At a temperature of 100°, however,
it easily undergoes such operations, and can then be drawn into wire
or rolled into sheets. If heated further it again becomes brittle, and
at 200° may be even crushed into powder, so completely does it lose
its molecular cohesion. It melts at 418°, and distils at 930°.</p>

<p>Zinc does not undergo any change in the atmosphere. Even in
very damp air it only becomes slowly coated with a very thin white
coating of oxide. For this reason it is available for all objects which
are only in contact with air. Therefore sheet zinc may be used for
roofing and many other purposes.<a name="FNanchor_9_41" id="FNanchor_9_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_41" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> This great unchangeability of zinc
in the air shows its slight energy with regard to oxygen compared
with the metals already mentioned, which are capable of reducing zinc
from solutions. But zinc plays this part with regard to the remaining
metals&mdash;for example, it reduces salts of lead, copper, mercury, &amp;c.
Although zinc is an almost unoxidisable metal at the ordinary
temperature, it burns in the air on being heated, particularly when
in the form of shavings or in the condition of vapour. At the
ordinary temperature zinc does not decompose water&mdash;at any rate, if
the metal be in a dense mass. But even at a temperature of 100° zinc
begins little by little to decompose water; it easily displaces the
hydrogen of acids at the ordinary temperature, and of alkalis on
being heated.</p>

<p>In this respect the action of zinc varies a great deal with the
degree of its purity. Weak sulphuric acid (corresponding with the
composition H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O) at the ordinary temperature does not act at
all on chemically pure zinc, and even a stronger solution acts very
slowly. If the temperature be raised, and particularly if the zinc be
previously slightly heated, so as to cover the surface with a film of
oxide, chemically pure zinc acts on sulphuric acid. Thus, for example,
one cubic centimetre of zinc in sulphuric acid having a composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O at the ordinary temperature in two hours only dissolves
to the extent of 0·018 gram, and at a temperature of 100° about
3·5 grams. If we compare this slow action with that rapid evolution
of hydrogen which occurs in the case of commercial zinc, we see that
the influence of those impurities in the zinc is very great. Every
particle of charcoal or iron introduced into the mass of the zinc, and
likewise the connection of the zinc with a piece of another electro-negative
metal, assists such a dissolution. The slowness of the action
of sulphuric acid on pure zinc (and likewise on amalgamated zinc) may
also be explained by the fact that a layer of hydrogen<a name="FNanchor_10_42" id="FNanchor_10_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_42" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> collects on
the surface of the metal, preventing contact between the acid and the
metal.<a name="FNanchor_10_BIS_43" id="FNanchor_10_BIS_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_BIS_43" class="fnanchor">[10 bis]</a></p>

<p>The action of zinc on acids, and the consequent formation of zinc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
salts, interferes with its application in many cases, particularly for the
preservation of liquids either containing or capable of developing
acid. For this reason zinc vessels ought not to be used for the preparation
or preservation of food, as this often contains acids which form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
poisonous salts with the zinc. Even ordinary water, containing carbonic
acid, slowly attacks zinc.</p>

<p>Finely divided zinc, or <i>zinc dust</i>, obtained in the distillation of
the metal when the receiver is not heated up to the melting point, on
account of its presenting a large surface of contact and containing
foreign matter (particularly zinc oxide), has in the highest degree the
property of decomposing acids, and even water, which it easily decomposes,
particularly if slightly heated. On this account zinc dust is
often used in laboratories and factories as a reducing agent. A similar
influence of the finely divided state is also noticed in other metals&mdash;for
instance, copper and silver&mdash;which again shows the close connection
between chemical and physico-mechanical phenomena. We
must first of all turn to this close connection for an explanation
of the widely spread application of zinc in galvanic batteries, where
the chemical (latent, potential) energy of the acting substances is transformed
into (evident, kinetic) galvanic energy, and through this latter
into heat, light, or mechanical work.</p>

<p>Hermann and Stromeyer, in 1819, showed that <i>cadmium</i> is almost
always found with zinc, and in many respects resembles it. When
distilled the cadmium volatilises sooner, because it has a lower boiling
point. Sometimes the zinc dust obtained by the first distillation of
zinc contains as much as 5 per cent. of cadmium. When zinc blende,
containing cadmium, is roasted, the zinc passes into the state of
oxide, and the cadmium sulphide in the ore oxidises into cadmium
sulphate, CdSO<sub>4</sub>, which resists tolerably well the action of heat; therefore
if roasted zinc blende be washed with water, a solution of
cadmium sulphate will be obtained, from which it is very easy to
prepare metallic cadmium. Hydrogen sulphide may be used for
separating cadmium from its solutions; it gives <i>a yellow precipitate
of cadmium sulphide</i>, CdS (according to the equation CdSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S
= H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + CdS),<a name="FNanchor_11_44" id="FNanchor_11_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_44" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which, on account of its characteristic colour, is
used as a pigment.<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_45" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_45" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a> Cadmium sulphide, when strongly heated in
air, leaves cadmium oxide, from which the metal may be obtained in
precisely the same way as in the case of zinc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Cadmium is a white metal, and when freshly cut is almost as white
and lustrous as tin. It is so soft that it may be easily cut with a knife,
and so malleable that it can be easily drawn into wire, rolled into
sheets, &amp;c. Its specific gravity is 8·67, melting point 320°, boiling
point 770°; its vapours burn, forming a brown powder of the oxide.<a name="FNanchor_12_46" id="FNanchor_12_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_46" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Next to mercury it is the most volatile metal; hence Deville determined
the density of its vapours compared with hydrogen, and found
it to be equal to 57·1; therefore the molecule contains <i>one atom</i> whose
weight = 112. V. Meyer found the like for zinc; the molecule of
mercury also contains one atom.</p>

<p><i>Mercury</i> resembles zinc and cadmium in many respects, but presents
that distinction from them which is always noticed in all the heaviest
metals (with regard to atomic weight and density) compared with the
lighter ones&mdash;namely, that it oxidises with more difficulty, and its
compounds are more easily decomposed.<a name="FNanchor_12_BIS_47" id="FNanchor_12_BIS_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_BIS_47" class="fnanchor">[12 bis]</a> Besides compounds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
usual type RX<sub>2</sub>, it also gives those of the lower type, RX, which are
unknown for zinc and cadmium.<a name="FNanchor_13_48" id="FNanchor_13_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_48" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Mercury therefore gives salts of
the composition HgX (mercurous salts) and HgX<sub>2</sub> (mercuric salts), the
oxides having the formulæ Hg<sub>2</sub>O and HgO respectively.</p>

<p>Mercury is found <i>in nature</i> almost exclusively in combination with
sulphur (like zinc and cadmium, but is still rarer than them) in the
form known as cinnabar, HgS (Chapter XX., Note <a href="#Footnote_29_295">29</a>). It is far more
rarely met with in the native or metallic condition, and this in all
probability has been derived from cinnabar. Mercury ore is found only
in a few places&mdash;namely, in Spain (in Almaden), in Idria, Japan, Peru,
and California. About the year 1880 Minenkoff discovered a rich bed
of cinnabar in the Bahmout district (near the station of Nikitovka),
in the Government of Ekaterinoslav, so that now Russia even exports
mercury to other countries. Cinnabar is now being worked
in Daghestan in the Caucasus. Mercury ores are easily reduced to
metallic mercury, because the combination between the metal and the
sulphur is one of but little stability. Oxygen, iron, lime, and many
other substances, when heated, easily destroy the combination. If iron
is heated with cinnabar, iron sulphide is formed; if cinnabar is heated
with lime, mercury and calcium sulphide and sulphate are formed,
4HgS + 4CaO = 4Hg + 3CaS + CaSO<sub>4</sub>. On being heated in the air, or
roasted, the sulphur burns, oxidises, forming sulphurous anhydride,
and vapours of metallic mercury are formed. Mercury is more easily
distilled than all other metals, its boiling point being about 351°, and
therefore its separation from natural admixtures, decomposed by one of
the above-mentioned methods, is effected at the expense of a comparatively
small amount of heat. The mixture of mercury vapour,
air, and products of combustion obtained is cooled in tubes (by water
or air), and the mercury condenses as liquid metal.<a name="FNanchor_14_49" id="FNanchor_14_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_49" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Mercury, as everybody knows, is a liquid metal at the ordinary
temperature. In its lustre and whiteness it resembles silver.<a name="FNanchor_15_50" id="FNanchor_15_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_50" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> At
-39° mercury is transformed into a malleable crystalline metal; at 0°
its specific gravity is 13·596, and in the solid state at -40° it is
14·39.<a name="FNanchor_16_51" id="FNanchor_16_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_51" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Mercury does not change in the air&mdash;that is to say, it does
not oxidise at the ordinary temperature&mdash;but at a temperature
approaching the boiling-point, as was stated in the Introduction, it
oxidises, forming mercuric oxide. Both metallic mercury and its
compounds in general produce salivation, trembling of the hands,
and other unhealthy symptoms which are found in the workmen
exposed to the influence of mercurial vapours or the dust of its compounds.</p>

<p>As many of the compounds of mercury decompose on being heated&mdash;for
instance, the oxide or carbonate<a name="FNanchor_17_52" id="FNanchor_17_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_52" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;and as zinc, cadmium, copper,
iron, and other metals separate mercury from its salts,<a name="FNanchor_18_53" id="FNanchor_18_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_53" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> it is evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that mercury has less chemical energy than the metals already
described, even than zinc and cadmium. Nitric acid, when acting on
<i>an excess</i> of mercury at the ordinary temperature, gives mercurous
nitrate, HgNO<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_19_54" id="FNanchor_19_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_54" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The same acid, under the influence of heat and
when in excess (nitric oxide being liberated), forms mercuric
nitrate, Hg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. This,<a name="FNanchor_20_55" id="FNanchor_20_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_55" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> both in its composition and properties,
resembles the salts of zinc and cadmium. Dilute sulphuric acid
does not act on mercury, but strong sulphuric acid dissolves it, with
evolution of <i>sulphurous anhydride</i> (not hydrogen), and on being slightly
heated with an excess of mercury it forms the sparingly soluble mercurous
sulphate, Hg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; but if mercury be strongly heated with an
excess of the acid, the mercuric salt, HgSO<sub>4</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_21_56" id="FNanchor_21_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_56" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> is formed. Alkalis do
not act on mercury, but the non-metals chlorine, bromine, sulphur, and
phosphorus easily combine with it. They form, like the acids, two series
of compounds, HgX and HgX<sub>2</sub>. The oxygen compound of the first series
is the suboxide of mercury, or mercurous oxide, Hg<sub>2</sub>O, and of the
second order the oxide HgO, mercuric oxide. The chlorine compound
corresponding with the suboxide is HgCl (calomel), and with the oxide
HgCl<sub>2</sub> (corrosive sublimate or mercuric chloride). In the compounds
HgX, mercury resembles the metals of the first group, and more
especially silver. In the mercuric compounds there is an evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
resemblance to those of magnesium, cadmium, &amp;c. Here the atom
of mercury is bivalent, as in the type RX<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_22_57" id="FNanchor_22_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_57" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Every soluble mercurous
compound (corresponding with the type of the suboxide of
mercury), HgX, forms a white precipitate of calomel, HgCl, with
hydrochloric acid or a metallic chloride, because HgCl is very slightly
soluble in water, HgX + MCl = HgCl + MX. In soluble mercuric
compounds, HgX<sub>2</sub>, hydrochloric acid and metallic chlorides do not
form a precipitate, because corrosive sublimate, HgCl<sub>2</sub>, is soluble in
water. Alkali hydroxides precipitate the yellow mercuric oxide from
a solution of HgX<sub>2</sub>, and the black mercurous oxide from HgX.
Potassium iodide forms a dirty greenish precipitate, HgI, with
mercurous salts, HgX, and a red precipitate, HgI<sub>2</sub>, with the mercuric
salts, HgX<sub>2</sub>. These reactions distinguish the mercuric
from the mercurous salts, which latter represent the transition from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the mercuric salts to mercury itself, 2HgX = Hg + HgX<sub>2</sub>. The
salts, HgX, as well as HgX<sub>2</sub>, are reduced by nascent hydrogen (<i>e.g.</i>
from Zn + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), by such metals as zinc and copper, and also
by many reducing agents&mdash;for example, hypophosphorous acid, the
lowest grade of oxidation of phosphorus, by sulphurous anhydride,
stannous chloride, &amp;c. Under the action of these reagents the
mercuric salts are first transformed into the mercurous salts, and
the latter are then reduced to metallic mercury. This reaction is so
delicate that it serves to detect the smallest quantity of mercury;
for instance, in cases of poisoning, the mercury is detected by immersing
a copper plate in the solution to be tested, the mercury
being then deposited upon it (more readily on passing a galvanic
current). The copper plate, on being rubbed, shows a silvery
white colour; on being heated, it yields vapours of mercury, and
then again assumes its original red colour (if it does not oxidise).
The mercurous compounds, HgX, under the action of oxidising
agents, even air, pass into mercuric compounds, especially in the
presence of acids (otherwise a basic salt is produced), 2HgX + 2HX + O
= 2HgX<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O; but the mercuric compounds, when in contact with
mercury, change more or less readily, and turn into mercurous compounds,
HgX<sub>2</sub> + Hg = 2HgX. For this reason, in order to preserve
solutions of mercurous salts, a little mercury is generally added to
them.</p>

<p>The lowest oxygen compound of mercury&mdash;that is, <i>mercurous oxide</i>,
Hg<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;does not seem to exist, for the substance precipitated in the
form of a black mass by the action of alkalis on a solution of mercurous
salts gradually separates on keeping into the yellow mercuric
oxide and metallic mercury, as does also a simple mechanical mixture
of oxide, HgO, with mercury (Guibourt, Barfoed). The other
compound of mercury with oxygen is already known to us as <i>mercuric
oxide</i>, HgO, obtained in the form of a red crystalline substance by the
oxidation of mercury in the air, and precipitated as a yellow powder
by the action of sodium hydroxide on solutions of salts of the type
HgX<sub>2</sub>. In this case it is amorphous and more amenable to the
action of various reagents (Chap. XI., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_32_654">32</a>) than when it is in the
crystalline state. Indeed, on trituration, the red oxide is changed into
a powder of a yellow colour. It is very sparingly soluble in water, and
forms an alkaline solution which precipitates magnesia from the solution
of its salts.</p>

<p>Mercury combines directly with chlorine, and the first product of
combination is <i>calomel</i> or <i>mercurous chloride</i>, Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. This is obtained,
as above stated, in the form of a white precipitate by mixing solutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of mercurous salts with hydrochloric acid or with metallic
chlorides. A precipitate of calomel is also obtained by reducing a
boiling aqueous solution of corrosive sublimate, HgCl<sub>2</sub>, with sulphurous
anhydride. It is likewise produced by heating corrosive sublimate
with mercury.<a name="FNanchor_22_BIS_58" id="FNanchor_22_BIS_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_BIS_58" class="fnanchor">[22 bis]</a> Calomel may be distilled (although in so doing
it decomposes and recombines on cooling from a state of vapour); its
vapour density equals 118 compared with hydrogen (= 1) (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_23_59">23</a>).
In the solid state its specific gravity is 7·0; it crystallises in rhombic
prisms, is colourless, but has a yellowish tint, turns brown from the
action of light, and when boiled with hydrochloric acid decomposes into
mercury and corrosive sublimate. It is used as a strong purgative.
<i>Corrosive sublimate or mercuric chloride</i>, HgCl<sub>2</sub>, can be obtained from
or converted into calomel by many methods.<a name="FNanchor_23_59" id="FNanchor_23_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_59" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> An excess of chlorine
(for instance, <i>aqua regia</i>) converts calomel and also mercury into corrosive
sublimate. It owes its name corrosive sublimate to its volatility,
and, in medicine up to the present day, it is termed <i>Mercurius
sublimatus seu corrosivus</i>. The vapour density, compared with hydrogen
(= 1) is 135; therefore its molecule contains HgCl<sub>2</sub>. It forms
colourless prismatic crystals of the rhombic system, boils at 307°,
and is soluble in alcohol. It is usually prepared by subliming a
mixture of mercuric sulphate with common salt, HgSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaCl
= Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + HgCl<sub>2</sub>. Corrosive sublimate combines with mercuric
oxide, forming an oxychloride or basic salt,<a name="FNanchor_23_BIS_60" id="FNanchor_23_BIS_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_BIS_60" class="fnanchor">[23 bis]</a> of the composition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
HgCl<sub>2</sub>,2HgO (magnesium and zinc form similar compounds). This
compound is obtained by mixing a solution of corrosive sublimate
with mercuric oxide or with a solution of sodium bicarbonate. In
general, with both mercurous and mercuric salts, there is a marked
tendency to form basic salts.<a name="FNanchor_24_61" id="FNanchor_24_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_61" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Mercury has a remarkable power of forming very unstable compounds
with ammonia, in which the mercury replaces the hydrogen,
and, if a mercuric compound be taken, its atom occupies the place of
two atoms of the hydrogen in the ammonia. Thus Plantamour and
Hirtzel showed that precipitated mercuric oxide dried at a gentle
heat, when continuously heated (up to 100°-150°) in a stream of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
dry ammonia, leaves a brown powder of <i>mercuric nitride</i>, N<sub>2</sub>Hg<sub>3</sub>,
according to the equation 3HgO + 2NH<sub>3</sub> = N<sub>2</sub>Hg<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_24_BIS_62" id="FNanchor_24_BIS_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_BIS_62" class="fnanchor">[24 bis]</a> This
substance, which is attacked by water, acids, and alkalis (giving a
white powder), is very explosive when struck or rubbed, evolving
nitrogen, proving that the bond between the mercury and the nitrogen
is very feeble.<a name="FNanchor_25_63" id="FNanchor_25_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_63" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> By the action of liquefied ammonia on yellow mercuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
oxide Weitz also obtained an explosive compound, dimercurammonium
hydroxide, N<sub>2</sub>Hg<sub>4</sub>O, which corresponds with an ammonium oxide,
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O, in which the whole of the hydrogen is replaced by mercury.
A solution of ammonia reacts with mercuric oxide, forming the
hydroxide, NHg<sub>2</sub>.OH, to which a whole series of salts, NHg<sub>2</sub>X, correspond;
these are generally insoluble in water and capable of decomposing
with an explosion. But salts of the same type, but with one atom
of mercury, NH<sub>2</sub>HgX, are more frequently and more easily formed;
they were principally studied by Kane, although known much earlier.
Thus, if ammonia be added to a solution of corrosive sublimate
(or, still better, in reverse order), a precipitate is obtained known as
white precipitate (<i>Mercurius præcipitatus albus</i>) or <i>mercurammonium
chloride</i>, NH<sub>2</sub>HgCl, which may also be regarded not only as sal-ammoniac
with the substitution of H<sub>2</sub> by mercury, but also as HgX<sub>2</sub>, where
one X represents Cl and the other X represents the ammonia radicle,
HgCl<sub>2</sub> + 2NH<sub>3</sub> = NH<sub>2</sub>.HgCl + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. When heated, mercurammonium
chloride decomposes, yielding mercurous chloride; when
heated with dry hydrochloric acid it forms ammonium chloride and
mercuric chloride. Other simple and double salts of mercurammonium,
NH<sub>2</sub>HgX, are also known. Pici (1890) showed that all the compounds
HgH<sub>2</sub>NX may be regarded as compounds of the above-named Hg<sub>2</sub>NX
with NH<sub>4</sub>X because their sum equals 2HgH<sub>2</sub>X.<a name="FNanchor_25_BIS_64" id="FNanchor_25_BIS_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_BIS_64" class="fnanchor">[25 bis]</a></p>

<p>Mercury as a liquid metal is capable of dissolving other metals and
forming metallic solutions. These are generally called &lsquo;amalgams.&rsquo; The
formation of these solutions is often accompanied by the development
of a large amount of heat&mdash;for instance, when potassium and sodium
are dissolved (Chapter XII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_39_761">39</a>); but sometimes heat is absorbed,
as, for instance, when lead is dissolved. It is evident that phenomena
of this kind are exceedingly similar to the phenomena accompanying
the dissolution of salts and other substances in water, but here it is
easy to demonstrate that which is far more difficult to observe in the
case of salts: the solution of metals in mercury is accompanied by the
formation of definite chemical compounds of the mercury with the
metals dissolved. This is shown by the fact that when pressed (best
of all in chamois leather) such solutions leave solid, definite compounds
of mercury with metals. It is, however, very difficult to obtain
them in a pure state, on account of the difficulty of separating the last
traces of mercury, which is mechanically distributed between the
crystals of the compounds. Nevertheless, in many cases such compounds
have undoubtedly been obtained, and their existence is
clearly shown by the evident crystalline structure and characteristic
appearance of many amalgams. Thus, for instance, if about 2&frac12; p.c. of
sodium be dissolved in mercury, a hard, crystalline amalgam is obtained,
very friable and little changeable in air. It contains the compound
NaHg<sub>5</sub> (Chapter XII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_39_761">39</a>). Water decomposes it, with the evolution
of hydrogen, but more slowly than other sodium amalgams, and
this action of water only shows that the bond between the sodium
and the mercury is weak, just like the connection between mercury
and many other elements&mdash;for instance, nitrogen. Mercury directly
and easily dissolves potassium, sodium, zinc, cadmium, tin, gold, bismuth,
lead, &amp;c., and from such solutions or alloys it is in most cases
easy to extract definite compounds&mdash;thus, for instance, the compounds
of mercury and silver have the compositions HgAg and Ag<sub>2</sub>Hg<sub>3</sub>.
Objects made of copper when rubbed with mercury become covered
with a white coating of that metal, which slowly forms an amalgam;
silver acts in the same way, but more slowly, and platinum combines
with mercury with still greater difficulty. This metal only readily
forms an amalgam when in the form of a fine powder. If salts of
platinum in solution are poured on to an amalgam of sodium, the
latter element reduces the platinum, and the platinum separated is
dissolved by the mercury. Almost all metals readily form amalgams
if their solutions are decomposed by a galvanic current, where mercury
forms the negative pole. In this way an amalgam may even
be made with iron, although iron in a mass does not dissolve in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mercury. Some amalgams are found in nature&mdash;for instance, silver
amalgams. Amalgams are used in considerable quantities in the arts.
Thus the solubility of silver in mercury is taken advantage of for
extracting that metal from the ore by means of amalgamation, and
for silvering by fire. The same is the case with gold. Tin amalgam,
which is incapable of crystallising and is obtained by dissolving
tin in mercury, composes the brilliant coating of ordinary looking-glasses,
which is made to adhere to the surface of the polished
glass by simply pressing by mechanical means sheets of tin foil bathed
in mercury on to the cleansed surface of the glass.<a name="FNanchor_26_65" id="FNanchor_26_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_65" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (<i>See</i> &lsquo;The

galvanic batteries containing zinc and sulphuric acid. When the anhydrous salt is heated
it forms zinc oxide, sulphurous anhydride, and oxygen. The solubility in 100 parts of
water at O° = 43, 20° = 53, 40° = 63&frac12;, 60° = 74, 80° = 84&frac12;, 100° = 95 parts of anhydrous zinc
sulphate&mdash;that is to say, it is closely expressed by the formula 43 + 0·52<i>t</i>.</p>

<p>An admixture of iron is often found in ordinary sulphate of zinc in the form of ferrous
sulphate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>, isomorphous with the zinc sulphate. In order to separate it, chlorine is
passed through the solution of the impure salt (when the ferrous salt is converted into
ferric), the solution is then boiled, and zinc oxide is afterwards added, which, after some
time has elapsed, precipitates all the ferric oxide. Ferric oxide of the form R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is displaced
by zinc oxide of the form RO.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_32" id="Footnote_2_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_32"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Zinc oxide is obtained both by the combustion and oxidation of zinc, and by the
ignition of some of its salts&mdash;for instance, those of carbonic and nitric acids; it is likewise
precipitated by alkalis from a solution of ZnX<sub>2</sub> in the form of a gelatinous hydroxide.
The oxide produced by roasting zinc blende (by burning in the air, when the sulphur is
converted into sulphurous anhydride) contains various impurities. For purification, the
oxide is mixed with water, and the sulphurous anhydride formed by roasting the blende
is passed through it. Zinc bisulphite, ZnSO<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, then passes into solution. If a
solution of this salt be evaporated, and the residue ignited, zinc oxide, free from many
of its impurities, will remain. Zinc oxide is a light white powder, used as a paint instead
of <i>white lead</i>; the basic salt, corresponding with magnesia alba, is used for the same
purpose. V. Kouriloff (1890) by boiling the hydrate of the oxide with a 3 p.c. solution of
peroxide of hydrogen obtained Zn<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or the hydrate of the peroxide (= ZnO<sub>2</sub>ZnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
or a compound of 2ZnO with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which did not part with its oxygen at 100°, but
only above 120°. Cadmium gives a similar compound of a yellow colour. Magnesium,
although it does form such a compound, does so with great difficulty.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_33" id="Footnote_3_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_33"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> For the solution of one part of the oxide 55,400 parts of water are required. Nevertheless,
even in such a weak solution, zinc oxide (hydroxide, ZnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) changes the colour
of red litmus paper. Zinc oxide is obtained in the wet way by adding an alkali hydroxide
to a solution of a zinc salt&mdash;for instance: ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + 2HKO = K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + ZnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The
gelatinous precipitate of zinc hydroxide is <i>soluble</i> in an excess of alkali, which clearly
distinguishes it from magnesia. This solubility of zinc hydroxide in alkalis is due to the
power of zinc oxide to form a compound, although an unstable one, with alkalis&mdash;that is
to say, points to the fact that zinc oxide already partly belongs to the intermediate oxides.
The oxides of the metals above mentioned (except BeO) do not show this property. The
property which metallic zinc itself has of dissolving in caustic alkali with the disengagement
of hydrogen (the solution is facilitated by contact with platinum or iron) depends
on the formation of such a compound of the oxides of zinc and the alkali metals. The
solution of zinc hydroxide, ZnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in potash (in a strong solution), proceeds when these
hydrates are taken in proportion to ZnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + KHO. If such a solution be evaporated to
dryness, water extracts only caustic potash from the fused residue. When a solution of
zinc hydroxide in strong alkali is mixed with a large mass of water, nearly all the oxide
of zinc is precipitated; and, therefore, in weak solutions, a large quantity of the alkali is
required to effect solution, which points to the decomposition of the zinc-alkali compounds
by water. If strong alcohol be added to a solution of zinc oxide in sodium hydroxide,
the crystallo-hydrate, 2Zn(OH)(ONa),7H<sub>2</sub>O, separates.</p></div>

by dissolving zinc in hydrochloric acid. This solution is used for soldering metals,
impregnating wood, &amp;c. The reason why it is thus employed may be understood from its
properties. When evaporated it first parts with its water of crystallisation; on being
further heated, however, it loses all traces of water, and forms an oily mass of anhydrous
salt which solidifies on cooling. This substance melts at 250°, commences to volatilise
at about 400°, and boils at 730°. The soldering of metals&mdash;that is, the introduction
of an easily fusible metal between two contiguous metallic objects&mdash;is hindered
by any film of oxide upon them; and, as heated metals easily oxidise, they are naturally
difficult to solder. Zinc chloride is used to prevent the oxidation. It fuses on being
heated, and, covering the metal with an oily coating, prevents contact with the air;
but even if any oxide has formed, the free hydrochloric acid generally existing in the
zinc chloride solution dissolves it, and in this way the metallic surface of the metals
to be soldered is preserved fit for the adhesion of the liquid solder, which, on
cooling, binds the objects together. Much zinc chloride is used also for steeping
wood (telegraph-posts and railway-sleepers) in order to preserve it from decaying
quickly; this preservative action is in all probability mainly due to the poisonous
character of zinc salts (corrosive sublimate is still more poisonous, and a still better
agent to preserve wood from decay), since decay is due to the action of lower
organisms.</p>

<p>Zinc chloride has a great affinity for water; it is not only soluble in it, but in alcohol,
and on being dissolved in water becomes considerably heated, like magnesium and
calcium chlorides. Zinc chloride is capable of taking up water, not only in a free state,
but also in chemical combination with many substances. Thus, for instance, it is
used in organic researches for removing the elements of water from many of the organic
compounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_BIS_35" id="Footnote_4_BIS_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_BIS_35"><span class="label">[4 bis]</span></a> When mixed with zinc oxide it forms, with remarkable ease, a very hard mass of
zinc oxychloride, which is applied in the arts; for instance, in painting, to resist the
action of water, or for cementing such objects as are destined to remain in water. Zinc
oxychloride, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>,3ZnO,2H<sub>2</sub>O (= Zn<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub>,2ZnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), is also formed from a solution of
zinc chloride by the action of a small quantity of ammonia on it after heating the precipitate
obtained with the liquid for a considerable time; the admixture of ammonium
salts with a mixture of a strong solution of zinc chloride with its oxide makes a similar
mass, which does not solidify so rapidly, and is therefore more useful for some purposes.
Moisture and cold do not change the hardened mass of oxychloride, and it also resists
the action of many acids, and a temperature of 300°, which makes it a useful cement for
many purposes. A solution of magnesium chloride with magnesium oxide forms a
similar oxychloride. The mass solidifies best when there are equal quantities by weight
of zinc in the chloride and oxide, and therefore when it has the composition Zn<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub>
In preparing such a cement, naturally zinc oxide alone may be taken, and the requisite
quantity of hydrochloric acid added to it. The capacity of ZnCl<sub>2</sub> to combine with water,
ZnO, and HCl (and also with other metallic chlorides) indicates its property to combine
with molecules of other substances, and therefore its compounds with NH<sub>3</sub>, and especially
a compound, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>2NH<sub>3</sub>, similar to sal-ammoniac, might be expected (<i>i.e.</i> 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, in
which H<sub>2</sub> is replaced by Zn). And indeed it has long been known that ZnCl<sub>2</sub> absorbs
ammonia and gives solid substances capable of dissociating with the disengagement of
NH<sub>3</sub>. Among these compounds Isambert and V. Kouriloff (1894) obtained ZnCl<sub>2</sub>6NH<sub>3</sub>,
ZnCl<sub>2</sub>4NH<sub>3</sub>, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>2NH<sub>3</sub>, and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>. The dissociation tension of the two last-mentioned
compounds at 218° is equal to 43·6 mm. and 6·7 mm. CdCl<sub>2</sub> also forms
similar compounds with NH<sub>3</sub> (Kouriloff, 1894).</p></div>

appearance (considerable density, 4·06, &amp;c.) of ordinary metallic ores; it deceived the
first miners, because it did not, like other ores, give metal when simply roasted in air and
fused with charcoal. The white zinc oxide, formed by burning the vapours of zinc, was
also called &rsquo;nihil album,&rsquo; or &lsquo;white nothing,&rsquo; on account of its lightness.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_37" id="Footnote_6_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_37"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> It may be here mentioned that by the word <i>ore</i> is meant a hard, heavy substance
dug out of the earth, which is used in metallurgical works for obtaining the usual heavy
metals long known and used. The natural compounds of sodium, or magnesium, are
not called ores, because magnesium and sodium have not been long obtainable in quantity.
The heavy metals, those which are easily reduced and do not easily oxidise, are
exclusively those which are directly applied in manufactures. Ores either contain the metals
themselves (for instance, ores of silver or bismuth), and the metals are then said to be in a
native state, or else their sulphur compounds (blende, mock-ore, pyrites&mdash;as, for example,
galena, PbS; zinc blende, ZnS; copper pyrites, CuFeS) or oxides (as the ores of iron), or
salts (calamine, for instance). Zinc is incomparably rarer than magnesium, and is only
well known because it is transformed from its ores into a metal which finds direct use in
many branches of industry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_38" id="Footnote_7_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_38"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Ores, when extracted from the earth by the miners, are often enriched by sorting,
washing, and other mechanical operations. The sulphurous ores (and likewise others)
are then generally roasted. Roasting an ore means heating it to redness in air. The
sulphur then burns, and passes off in the form of sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, and the
metal oxidises. The roasting is carried on in order to obtain an oxide instead of a
sulphur compound, the oxide being reducible by charcoal. These methods, introduced
ages ago, are met with in nearly all metallurgical works for practically all ores. For
this reason the preparatory treatment of zinc blende furnishes zinc oxide: this is already
contained in calamine.</p></div>

zinc), the vapour of the reduced zinc is allowed to pass directly into the air. It burns

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_40" id="Footnote_8_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_40"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> This zinc, although homogeneous, still contains certain impurities, to remove which
it is necessary to prepare some salt of zinc in a pure state and transform it into carbonate,
which latter is then distilled with charcoal; and, as thin sheets of zinc can only be obtained
from very pure metal, they are frequently made use of in cases where pure zinc is required.
In order to remove the arsenic from zinc, it was proposed to melt it and mix it with
anhydrous magnesium chloride, by which means vapours of zinc chloride and arsenic
chloride are formed. Perfectly pure zinc is made (V. Meyer and others) by decomposing,
by means of the galvanic current, a solution of zinc sulphate to which an excess of
ammonia has been added. The zinc used for Marsh's arsenic test (Chapter <a href="#Page_149">XIX.</a>) is
purified from As by fusing it with KNO<sub>3</sub> and then with ZnCl<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

beauty, are stamped out of sheet zinc. Zinc-roofing does not require painting, but it
melts during a conflagration, and even burns at a strong heat. Many iron vessels, &amp;c.,
are covered with zinc (&lsquo;galvanised&rsquo;) in order to prevent them from rusting.</p></div>

proceeds far more rapidly for both pure and commercial zinc, and still more rapidly in
the presence of oxidising agents (which absorb the hydrogen) like CrO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_BIS_43" id="Footnote_10_BIS_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_BIS_43"><span class="label">[10 bis]</span></a> The addition of cupric sulphate, or, better still, a few drops of platinic chloride
(the metals become reduced), to the sulphuric acid greatly accelerates the evolution of the
hydrogen, because in this case, as with commercial zinc, galvanic couples are formed
locally by the copper or platinum and the zinc, under the influence of which the zinc
rapidly dissolves. The action of acids on metallic zinc of various degrees of purity has
been the subject of many investigations, particularly important with reference to the
application of zinc in galvanic batteries, whilst some investigations have direct significance
for chemical mechanics, although from many points of view the matter is not
clear. I consider it useful to mention certain of these investigations.</p>

<p>Calvert and Johnson made the following series of observations on the action of sulphuric
acid of various degrees of concentration on 2 grams of pure zinc during two hours.
In the cold the concentrated acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, does not act, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O dissolves about
0·002 gram, but principally forms hydrogen sulphide, which is obtained also when the
dilution reaches H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, when 0·035 gram of zinc is dissolved. When largely
diluted with water, pure hydrogen begins to be disengaged. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O at 130° gives
a mixture of hydrogen sulphide and sulphurous anhydride dissolving 0·156 gram of zinc.</p>

<p>Bouchardat showed that if in a vessel made of glass or sulphur dilute sulphuric acid
acting on a piece of zinc liberates one part of hydrogen, then the same acid with the same
piece of zinc in the same time will liberate 4 parts of hydrogen if the vessel be made of
tin&mdash;that is, zinc forms a galvanic couple with tin; in a leaden vessel 9 parts of hydrogen
are set free, with a vessel of antimony or bismuth 13 parts, silver or platinum 38 parts,
copper 50 parts, iron 43 parts. If a salt of platinum be added to the dilute sulphuric
acid (1 part of acid and 12 parts of water), Millon determined that the rapidity of the
action on the zinc is increased 149 times, and by the addition of copper sulphate is rendered
45 times greater than the action of pure sulphuric acid. The salts which are
added are reduced to metals by the zinc, their contact serving to promote the reaction
because they form local galvanic currents.</p>

<p>According to the observations of Cailletet, if, at the ordinary pressure, sulphuric acid
with zinc liberates 100 parts of hydrogen, then with a pressure of 60 atmospheres
47 parts will be liberated and 1 part at a pressure of 120 atmospheres. With a reduced
pressure under the receiver of an air-pump 168 parts are liberated. Helmholtz showed
that a reduced pressure also exercises its influence on galvanic elements.</p>

<p>Debray, Löwel, and others showed that zinc liberates hydrogen and forms basic salts
and zinc oxide with solutions of many salts&mdash;for instance, MCl<sub><i>n</i></sub>, aluminium sulphate, and
alum, Sodium and potassium carbonates scarcely act, because they form carbonates.
The salts of ammonia act more strongly than the salts of potassium and sodium; the
zinc remains bright. It is evident that this action is founded on the formation of
double salts and basic salts.</p>

<p>The variation with concentration in the rate of the action of sulphuric acid on zinc
(containing impurities) under otherwise uniform conditions is in evident connection with
the electrical conductivity of the solution and its viscosity, although, when largely
diluted, the action is almost proportional to the amount of acid in a known volume of
the solution. Forging, casting the molten metal, and similar mechanical influences
change the density and hardness of zinc, and also strongly influence its power of liberating
hydrogen from acids. Kayander showed (1881) that when magnesium is submitted to
the action of acids: (<i>a</i>) the action depends, not on the nature of the acid, but on its
basicity; (<i>b</i>) the increase of the action is more rapid than the growth of the concentration;
and (<i>c</i>) there is a decrease of action with the increase of the coefficient of internal
friction and electrical conductivity.</p>

<p>Spring and Aubel (1887) measured the volume of hydrogen disengaged by an alloy
of zinc and a small quantity of lead (0·6 p.c.), because the action of acids is then uniform.
In order to deal with a known surface, spheres were taken (9·5 millimetres
diameter) and cylinders (17 mm. dia.), the sides of which were covered with wax in order
to limit the action to the end surfaces. During the commencement of the action of a
definite quantity of acid the rapidity increases, attains a maximum, and then declines as
the acid becomes exhausted. The results for 5, 10, and 15 per cent. of hydrochloric acid
are given below. H denotes the number of cubic centimetres of hydrogen, D the time
in seconds elapsing after the zinc spheres have been plunged into the acid. At 15° were
obtained:</p>

<p>In consequence of the complex character of the phenomenon, the authors themselves
do not consider their determinations as being conclusive, and only give them a relative
significance; and in this connection it is remarkable that hydrobromic acid under similar
conditions (with an equivalent strength) gives a greater (from 2 to 5 times) rapidity of
action than hydrochloric acid, but sulphuric acid a far smaller velocity (nearly 25 times
smaller). It is also remarkable that during the reaction the metal becomes much more
heated than the acid.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that zinc dust and zinc itself, when heated with hydrated lime
and similar hydrates, disengages hydrogen: this method has even been proposed for
obtaining hydrogen for filling war balloons.</p></div>

(1890) studied the physical properties of these varieties more closely. The sp. gr. of the
former is 3·906, and of the latter 4·513. They belong to different crystallographic
systems. The first variety may be converted into the second by friction or pressure, but
the second cannot be converted into the first variety by these means.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_46" id="Footnote_12_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_46"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Amongst the compounds of cadmium very closely allied to the compounds of zinc,
we must mention <i>cadmium iodide</i>, CdI<sub>2</sub>, which is used in medicine and photography.
This salt crystallises very well: it is prepared by the direct action of iodine, mixed with
water, on metallic cadmium. One part of cadmium iodide at 20° requires for its solution
1·08 part of water. It may be remarked that cadmium chloride at the same temperature
requires 0·71 part of water to dissolve it, so that the iodine compound of this metal is
less soluble than the chloride, whilst the reverse relation holds in the case of the corresponding
compounds of the alkali or alkaline earthy metals. Cadmium sulphate crystallises
well, and has the composition 3CdSO<sub>4</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O, thus differing from zinc sulphate.</p>

<p>Cadmium oxide is soluble, although sparingly, in alkalis, but in the presence of
tartaric and certain other acids the alkaline solution of cadmium oxide does not change
when boiled, whilst a <i>diluted</i> solution in that case deposits cadmium oxide: this may
also serve for separating zinc compounds from those of cadmium. Cadmium is precipitated
from its salts by zinc, which fact may also be taken advantage of for separating
cadmium; for this reason, in an alloy of zinc and cadmium, acids first of all extract the
zinc. Cadmium is in all respects less energetic than zinc. Thus, for instance, it decomposes
water with difficulty, and this only when strongly heated. It even acts but slowly
on acids, but then displaces hydrogen from them. It is necessary here to call attention
to the fact that for alkali and alkaline earthy metals (of the even series) the highest
atomic weight determines the greatest energy; but cadmium (of the uneven series),
whilst having a larger atomic weight than zinc, is less energetic. The salts of cadmium
are colourless, like those of zinc. De Schulten obtained a crystalline oxychloride,
Cd(OH)Cl by heating marble with a solution of cadmium chloride in a sealed tube
at 200°.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Eventually we shall see the near relation of platinum, palladium, and nickel, and also of
gold, silver, and copper, but we will now point out the parallelism between these three
groups. The relation between the physical and also chemical properties is here strikingly
similar. Nickel, palladium, and platinum are very difficult to fuse (far more so than iron,
ruthenium, and osmium, which stand before them). Copper, silver, and gold melt far more
easily in a strong heat than the three preceding metals, and zinc, cadmium, and mercury
melt still more easily. Nickel, palladium, and platinum are very slightly volatile;
copper, silver, and gold are more volatile; and zinc, cadmium, and mercury are among
the most volatile metals. Zinc oxidises more easily than copper, and is reduced with
more difficulty, and the same is true for mercury as compared with gold. These properties
for cadmium and silver are intermediate in the respective groups. Relations of
this kind clearly show the nature of the periodic law.</p></div>

mass of finely-divided particles, which gives metallic mercury when worked up in centrifugal
machines, or on pressure, or on re-distillation. In mercury we observe a tendency
to easily split up into the finest drops, which are difficult to unite into a dense
mass. It is sufficient to shake up mercury with nitric and sulphuric acids in order to
produce such a mercury <i>powder</i>. The mercury separated (for instance, reduced by substances
like sulphurous anhydride) from solutions, forms such a powder. According to
the experiments of Nernst, this disintegrated mercury when entering into reactions
develops more heat than the dense liquid metal&mdash;that is to say, the work of disintegration
reappears in the form of heat. This example is instructive in considering thermochemical
deductions.</p></div>

bottles holding about 35 kilos), but after being used in laboratories (for baths, calibration,
&amp;c.) it contains impurities. It may be purified mechanically in the following way: a
paper filter with a fine hole (pricked with a needle) is placed in a glass funnel and mercury
is poured into it, which slowly trickles through the hole, leaving the impurities upon
the filter. Sometimes it is squeezed through chamois leather or through a block of wood
(as in the well-known experiment with the air-pump). It may be purified from many
metals by contact with dilute nitric acid, if small drops of mercury are allowed to pass
through a long column of it (from the fine end of a funnel); or by shaking it up with
sulphuric acid in air. Mercury may be purified by the action of an electric current, if it

barometers and thermometers can only be attained by distillation, best in a vacuum
(the vapour-tension of mercury is given in Chapter II., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_27_151">27</a>). For this purpose
Weinhold's apparatus is most often used. The principle of this apparatus is very
ingenious, the distillation being effected in a Torricellian vacuum continuously supplied
with fresh mercury, whilst the condensed mercury is continuously removed. This
process of distillation requires very little attention, and gives about one kilo of pure
mercury per hour.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_57" id="Footnote_22_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_57"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The question of the molecular weight of calomel&mdash;that is, whether the mercury in
the salts of the suboxide is monatomic or diatomic&mdash;long occupied the minds of chemists,
although it is not of very great importance. It is only recently (1894) that this question
can be considered as answered, thanks to the researches of V. Meyer and Harris, in
favour of diatomicity&mdash;that is, that calomel is analogous to peroxide of hydrogen and
contains Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (like O<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) in its molecule if corrosive sublimate contains HgCl<sub>2</sub>
(like water OH<sub>2</sub>). As a matter of fact, direct experiment gives the vapour density of
calomel as about 118&mdash;that is, indicates that its molecule contains HgCl, whilst the
molecule of the sublimate, judging also by the vapour density (nearly 136), contains
HgCl<sub>2</sub>; it might therefore be concluded that the mercury in the suboxide is not only
monovalent (corresponding to H) but also monatomic, whilst in the oxide it is divalent
and diatomic. Instances of a variable atomicity, as shown by the vapour density, are
known in N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, and NH<sub>3</sub>, CO and CO<sub>2</sub>, PCl<sub>3</sub> and PCl<sub>5</sub>, and it might therefore be
supposed that the present was a similar instance. But there are also instances of a
variable equivalency which do not correspond to a variation of atomicity&mdash;for example,
OH<sub>2</sub> (water) and OH (peroxide of hydrogen), CH<sub>4</sub> (methane), C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> (ethyl), and
CH<sub>2</sub> (ethylene), &amp;c. Here, according to the law of substitution, the residues of OH<sub>2</sub> and
CH<sub>4</sub> combine together and give molecules; OHOH = O<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> (peroxide of hydrogen) and
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (ethane), &amp;c. The same may be assumed also to be the relation of
calomel to sublimate; the residue HgCl, which is combined with Cl in sublimate,
corresponds to HgCl<sub>2</sub>, and in calomel it may be supposed that this residue is combined
with itself, forming the molecule Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. On this view of the composition of the
molecule of calomel it would follow that in the state of vapour it breaks up into two
molecules, HgCl<sub>2</sub> and Hg, when the vapour density would be about 118 (because that of
sublimate is about 136 and that of mercury about 100), and that in cooling this mixture
(like a mixture of HCl and NH<sub>3</sub>) again gives Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. It was therefore necessary to
prove that calomel is decomposed in the state of vapour. This was not effected for a
long time, although Odling, as far back as the thirties, showed that gold becomes
amalgamated (<i>i.e.</i> absorbs metallic mercury) in the vapour of calomel, but not in the
vapour of sublimate. Recently, however, V. Meyer and Harris (1894) have shown that
a greater amount of the vapour of mercury than of calomel passes (at about 465°)
through a porous clay cell, containing calomel. This proves that the vapour of calomel
contains a mixture of the vapours of Hg and HgCl<sub>2</sub>, as would follow from the second
hypothesis. Moreover, on introducing a heated piece of KHO into the vapour of
calomel, Meyer observed the formation, not of suboxide (black), but of oxide of mercury
(yellow). Therefore the molecular formula of calomel must be taken as Hg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (and not
HgCl).</p></div>

mercurous nitrate, when treated with water, forms basic salts of the composition
6(HgNO<sub>3</sub>),Hg<sub>2</sub>O,H<sub>2</sub>O, 2(HgNO<sub>3</sub>),Hg<sub>2</sub>O,H<sub>2</sub>O, and 3(HgNO<sub>3</sub>),Hg<sub>2</sub>O,H<sub>2</sub>O, the first two of
which crystallise well. Naturally it is possible either to refer similar salts to the
type of hydrates&mdash;for instance, the second salt to the hydrate N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;or to view
it as a compound, HgNO<sub>3</sub>,HgHO, but our present knowledge of basic salts is not
sufficiently complete to admit of generalisations. However, it is already possible to
view the subject in the following aspects: (1) basic salts are principally formed from
feeble bases; (2) certain metals (mentioned above) form them with particular ease, so that
one of the causes of the formation of many basic salts must depend on the property of the
metal itself; (3) those bases which readily form basic salts as a rule also readily form
double salts; (4) in the formation of basic salts, as also everywhere in chemistry, where
sufficient facts have accumulated, we clearly see the conditions of equally balanced
heterogeneous systems, such as we saw, for instance, in the formation of double salts,
crystallo-hydrates, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The mercuric salts often form double salts (confirming the third thesis), and mercuric
chloride easily combines with ammonia, forming Hg(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>, or in general HgCl<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>MCl.
If a mixture of mercurous and potassium sulphates be dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid,
the solution easily yields large colourless crystals of a double salt of the composition
K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,3HgSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. Boullay obtained crystalline compounds of mercuric chloride with
hydrochloric acid, and mercuric iodide with hydriodic acid; and Thomsen describes the
compound HgBr<sub>2</sub>,HBr,4H<sub>2</sub>O as a well-crystallised salt, melting at 13°, and having, in
a molten state, a specific gravity 3·17 and a high index of refraction. Moreover, the
capacity of salts for forming basic compounds has been considerably cleared up since the
investigation (by Würtz, Lorenz, and others) of glycol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> (and of polyatomic
alcohols resembling it), because the ethers C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>X<sub>2</sub>, corresponding with it, are capable of
forming compounds containing C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>X<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is reason to think that the property of forming basic salts is
connected with the polymerisation of bases, especially colloidal ones (<i>see</i> the chapter
on Silica, Lead Salts, and Tungstic Acid).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_61" id="Footnote_24_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_61"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Mercuric iodide, HgI<sub>2</sub>, is obtained first as a yellow, and then as a red, precipitate on
mixing solutions of mercuric salts and potassium iodide, and is soluble in an excess of the
latter (in consequence of the formation of the double salt, HgKI<sub>3</sub>); of ammonium chloride
(for a similar reason), &amp;c. It crystallises at the ordinary temperature in square prisms
of a red colour. On being heated, these change into yellow rhombic crystals, isomorphous
with mercuric chloride. This yellow form of mercuric iodide is very unstable, and when
cooled and triturated easily again assumes the more stable red form. When fused, a
yellow liquid is obtained. <i>Mercuric cyanide</i>, Hg(CN)<sub>2</sub>, forms one of the most stable
metallic cyanides. It is obtained by dissolving mercuric oxide in prussic acid, and by
boiling Prussian blue with water and mercuric oxide, ferric oxide being then obtained in
the precipitate. Mercuric cyanide is a colourless crystalline substance, soluble in water,
and distinguished by its great stability; sulphuric acid does not liberate prussic acid
from it, and even caustic potash does not remove the cyanogen (a complex salt is
probably produced), but the halogen acids disengage HCN. Like the chloride, it combines
with mercuric oxide, forming the oxycyanide, Hg<sub>2</sub>O(CN)<sub>2</sub>, and it shows a very marked
tendency to form double compounds&mdash;for example, K<sub>2</sub>Hg(CN)<sub>4</sub>. The alkali chlorides and
iodides form similar compounds&mdash;for instance, the salt HgKI(CN)<sub>2</sub> crystallises very well,
and is produced by directly mixing solutions of potassium iodide and mercuric cyanide.</p>

(Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_581">XIV.</a>) The readiness with
which mercuric nitride explodes shows that the connection between the nitrogen
and the mercury is very unstable, and explains the circumstance that the so-called
<i>mercury fulminate</i>, or <i>fulminating mercury</i>, is an exceedingly explosive substance.
This substance is prepared in large quantities for explosive mixtures; it enters into the
composition of percussion caps, which explode when struck, and ignite gunpowder.
Mercury fulminate was discovered by Howard, and from that time has been prepared in
the following way: one part of mercury is dissolved in twelve parts of nitric acid, of
sp. gr. 1·36, and when the whole of the mercury is dissolved, 5·5 parts of 90 p.c. alcohol
are added, and the mass is shaken. A reaction then commences, accompanied by a rise in
temperature due to the oxidation of the alcohol. As a matter of fact, many oxidation
products are produced during the action of the nitric acid on the alcohol (glycolic acid,
ethers, &amp;c.) When the reaction becomes tolerably vigorous, the same quantity of alcohol
is added as at the commencement, when a grey precipitate of the fulminate separates.
This salt has the composition C<sub>2</sub>Hg(NO<sub>2</sub>)N. It explodes when struck or heated. The
mercury in it may be replaced by other metals&mdash;for instance, copper or zinc, and also
silver. The silver salt, C<sub>2</sub>Ag<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)N, is obtained in a precisely analogous manner, and is
even more explosive. Under the action of alkali chlorides, only half the silver is replaced
by the alkali metal, but if the whole of the silver be replaced by an alkali metal, then
the salt decomposes. This is evidently because combinations of this kind proceed in virtue
of the formation of substances in which mercury, and metals akin to it, are connected
in an unstable way with nitrogen. Potassium and other light metals are incapable of
entering into such connection and therefore, the substitution of potassium for mercury
entails the splitting-up of the combination. Investigations of the fulminates were
carried on by Gay-Lussac and Liebig, but only the investigations of L. N. Shishkoff
fully cleared up the composition and relation of these substances to the other carbon
compounds. Shishkoff showed that fulminates correspond with the nitro-acid,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)N. The explosiveness of the group depends partly on its containing at the same
time NO<sub>2</sub> and carbon; we already know that all such nitrogen compounds are explosive.
If we imagine that the NO<sub>2</sub> is replaced by hydrogen, we shall have a substance of the
composition C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N. This is acetonitrile&mdash;that is, acetic acid + NH<sub>3</sub> - 2H<sub>2</sub>O, or ethenyl
nitrile, as shown in Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_246">VI.</a> The formation of an acetic compound by the action of
nitric acid on alcohol is easily understood, because acetic acid is produced by the oxidation
of alcohol, and the production of the elements of ammonia, indispensable for the
formation of a nitrile, is accounted for by the fact that nitric acid under the action of
reducing substances in many cases forms ammonia. Moreover a certain analogy has
been found between fulminating acid and hydroxylamine, but details upon this subject
must be looked for in works on organic chemistry. The explosiveness of fulminating
mercury, the rapidity of its decomposition (gunpowder, and even guncotton, burn more
slowly and explode less violently), and the force of its explosion, are such that a small
quantity (loosely covered) will shatter massive objects.</p>

<p>The investigations of Abel on the communication of explosion from one substance to
another are remarkable. If guncotton be ignited in an open space, it burns quietly; but
if fulminating mercury be exploded by the side of it, the decomposition of the guncotton
is effected instantaneously, and it then shatters the objects upon which it lies, so rapid is
the decomposition. Abel explains this by supposing that the explosion of the fulminating
salt brings the molecules of guncotton into a uniform or as it were harmonious state of
vibration, which causes the rapid decomposition of the whole mass. This rapid decomposition
of explosive substances defines the distinction between explosion and combustion.
Besides this, Berthelot showed that from that form of powerful molecular
concussion which takes place during the explosion of fulminating mercury, the state
of strain and stability of equilibrium of substances which are endothermal, or capable
of decomposing with the disengagement of heat&mdash;for instance, cyanogen, nitro compounds,
nitrous oxide, &amp;c.&mdash;is generally destroyed. Thorpe showed that carbon bisulphide, CS<sub>2</sub>,
also an endothermal substance, decomposes into sulphur and charcoal, when fulminating
mercury is exploded in contact with it.</p></div>

belongs to Zn and Cd. Kvasnik (1892), by the action of ammonia upon alcoholic solutions
of CdCl<sub>2</sub> and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, obtained substances of the general formula M(NH<sub>3</sub>Cl)<sub>2</sub>, formed
as it were from two molecules of sal-ammoniac by the substitution of two atoms of
hydrogen by a diatomic metal. These substances appear as white, finely crystalline
powders. Under the action of heat half the ammonia passes off, and a compound of the
composition MClNH<sub>3</sub>Cl is formed. The compounds of cadmium and zinc are distinguished
from each other by the former being more volatile than the latter.</p>

<p>We may further remark that in the series Mg, Zn, Cd, and Hg the capacity to form
double salts of diverse composition increases with the atomic weight. Thus, according to
Wells and Walden's observations (1893), the ratio <i>n</i> : <i>m</i> for the type <i>n</i>MCl<i>m</i>RCl<sub>2</sub>
(M = K, Li, Na &hellip; R = Mg, Zn &hellip;) is for Mg 1 : 1, for Zn 3 : 1, 2 : 1, and 1 : 1; for
Cd, besides this, salts are known with the ratio 4 : 1, and for Hg 3 : 1, 2 : 1, 1 : 1, 2 : 3, 1 :
2, and 1 : 5.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_65" id="Footnote_26_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_65"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> I consider it appropriate here to call attention to the want of an element (ekacadmium)
between cadmium and mercury in the periodic system (Chapter <a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>) But as
in the ninth series there is not a single known element, it may be that this series is entirely
composed of elements incapable of existing under present conditions. However, until this
is proved in one way or another, it may be concluded that the properties of ekacadmium
will be between those of cadmium and mercury. It ought to have an atomic weight of about
155, to form an oxide EcO, a slightly stable oxide Ec<sub>2</sub>O. Both ought to be feeble bases,
easily forming double and basic salts. The volume of the oxide will be nearly 17·5, because
the volume of cadmium oxide is about 16, and that of mercuric oxide 19. Therefore the
density of the oxide will approach 171 ÷ 17·5 = 9·7. The metal ought to be easily fusible,
oxidising when heated, of a grey colour, with a specific volume, about 14 (cadmium = 13,
mercury = 15), and, therefore, its specific gravity (155 ÷ 14) will nearly = 11. Such a metal is
unknown. But in 1879 Dahl, in Norway, discovered in the island of Oterö, not far from
Kragerö, in a vein of Iceland spar in a nickel mine, traces of a new metal which he called
norwegium, and which presented a certain resemblance to ekacadmium. Perfect purity
of the metal was not attained, and therefore the properties ascribed to norwegium must
be regarded as approximate, and likely to undergo considerable alteration on further
study. A solution of the roasted mineral in acid was twice precipitated by sulphuretted
hydrogen, and again ignited; the oxide obtained was easily reduced. When the metal
was dissolved in hydrochloric acid largely diluted with water, and the solution boiled, the
basic salt was precipitated, and thus freed from the copper which remained in the solution.
The reduced metal had a density 9·44, and easily oxidised. If the composition NgO
be assigned to the oxide, then Ng = 145·9. It fused at 254°; the hydroxide was soluble
in alkalis and potassium carbonate. In any case, if norwegium is not a mixture of other
metals, it belongs to the uneven series, because the heavy metals of the even series are
not easily reducible. Brauner thinks that norwegium oxide is Ng<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the atom Ng = 219,
and places it in Group VI., series 11, but then the feebly acid higher oxide, NgO<sub>3</sub>, ought
to be formed.</p>

<p>Amongst the metals accompanying zinc which have been named, but not authentically
separated, must be included the <i>actinium</i> of Phipson (1881). He remarked
that certain sorts of zinc give a white precipitate of zinc sulphide which blackens on
exposure to light and then becomes white in the dark again. Its oxide, closely resembling
in many ways cadmium oxide, is insoluble in alkalis, and it forms a white
metallic sulphide, blackening on exposure to light. As no further mention has been
made of it since 1882, its existence must be regarded as doubtful.</p></div>

forms BeX<sub>2</sub>, and then comes carbon giving CX<sub>4</sub>. Evidently to
complete the series we must look for an element forming RX<sub>3</sub>, and
having an atomic weight greater than 9 and less than 12. And <i>boron</i>
is such a one; its atomic weight is 11, and its compounds are expressed
by BX<sub>3</sub>. Lithium and beryllium are metals; carbon has no metallic
properties; boron appears in a free state in several forms which are
intermediate between the metals and non-metals. Lithium gives an
energetic caustic oxide, beryllium forms a very feeble base; hence one
would expect to find that the oxide of boron, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, has still more
feeble basic properties and some acid properties, all the more as CO<sub>2</sub>
and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which follow after B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in their composition and in the
periodic system, are acid oxides. And, indeed, the only known <i>oxide of
boron</i> exhibits a feeble basic character, together with the properties of
a feeble acid oxide. This is even seen from the fact that a solution of
boron oxide reddens blue litmus and acts on turmeric paper as an
alkali, and these reactions may be used for determining the presence of
B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in solutions. By themselves the alkali borates have an alkaline
reaction, which clearly indicates the feeble acid character of boric acid.
If they are mixed in solution with hydrochloric acid, boric acid is
liberated, and if a piece of turmeric paper be immersed in this solution
and then dried, the excess of hydrochloric acid volatilises, while the
boric acid remains on the paper and communicates a <i>brown coloration</i> to
it, just like alkalis.</p>

<p>Boron trioxide or boric anhydride enters into the composition of
many minerals, in the majority of cases in small quantities as an
isomorphous admixture, not replacing acids but bases, and most frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), for as a rule the amount of alumina decreases
as that of the boric anhydride increases in them. This substitution
is explained by the similarity between the atomic composition
of the oxides of aluminium (alumina) and boron. The subdivision of
oxides into basic and acid can in no way be sharply defined, and here
we meet with the most conclusive proof of the fact, for the oxides of
boron and aluminium belong to the number of intermediate oxides,
closely approaching the limit separating the basic from the acid oxides.
Their type (Chapter <a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>) R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is intermediate between those of the
basic oxides R<sub>2</sub>O and RO and those of the acid oxides R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and RO<sub>3</sub>.
If we turn our attention to the chlorides, we remark that lithium
chloride is soluble in water, is not volatile, and is not decomposed by
water; the chlorides of beryllium and magnesium are more volatile,
and although not entirely, still are decomposed by water; whilst the
chlorides of boron and aluminium are still more volatile and are decomposed
by water. Thus the position of boron and aluminium in the series
of the other elements is clearly defined by their atomic weights, and
shows us that we must not expect any new and distinct functions in
these elements.</p>

<p>Boron was originally known in the form of sodium borate,
Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, or <i>borax</i>, or <i>tincal</i>, which was exported from Asia,
where it is met with in solution in certain lakes of Thibet; it has also
been discovered in California and Nevada, U.S.A.<a name="FNanchor_1_66" id="FNanchor_1_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_66" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Boric acid was
afterwards found in sea-water and in certain mineral springs.<a name="FNanchor_2_67" id="FNanchor_2_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_67" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
presence may be discovered by means of the green coloration which it
communicates to the flame of alcohol, which is capable of dissolving free
boric acid.<a name="FNanchor_3_68" id="FNanchor_3_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_68" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Many of the boron compounds employed in the arts are
obtained from the impure boric acid which is extracted in Tuscany from
the so-called <i>suffioni</i>. In these localities, which present the remains
of volcanic action, steam mixed with nitrogen, hydrogen sulphide, small
quantities of boric acid, ammonia, and other substances, issue from the
earth.<a name="FNanchor_3_BIS_69" id="FNanchor_3_BIS_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_BIS_69" class="fnanchor">[3 bis]</a> The boric acid partially volatilises with the steam, for if a
solution of boric acid be boiled, the distillate will always contain a certain
amount of this substance.<a name="FNanchor_4_70" id="FNanchor_4_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_70" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>If boric acid be introduced into an excess of a strong hot solution
of sodium hydroxide, then, on slowly cooling, the salt NaBO<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O
crystallises out. This salt contains an equivalent of Na<sub>2</sub>O to one equivalent
B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. It might be termed a neutral salt did it not possess
strongly alkaline reactions and easily split up into the alkali and the
more stable borax or biborate of sodium mentioned above, which contains
2B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to Na<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_5_71" id="FNanchor_5_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_71" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This salt is prepared by the action of boric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
acid on a solution of sodium carbonate. Borax may be perfectly purified
by crystallisation. If a saturated and hot solution of borax be mixed
with strong hydrochloric acid, common salt and a normal crystalline
hydrate of <i>boric acid</i> are formed. The composition of this hydrate
is B(HO)<sub>3</sub>, according to the form BX<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, of the composition
B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. This is the easiest method of obtaining pure boric acid.
The water is easily expelled from this hydrate; it loses half at 100° and
the remainder on further heating, and the remaining B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or boric
anhydride fuses at 580° (according to Carnelley), forming at first a
ductile (easily drawn out into threads), tenacious mass and then a
colourless liquid solidifying to a transparent glass, which absorbs
moisture from the atmosphere and then becomes cloudy.<a name="FNanchor_6_72" id="FNanchor_6_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_72" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
alkaline salts of boric acid are soluble in water, but all borates are
soluble in acids, owing to their easy decomposability and the solubility
of boric acid itself. Although boric anhydride, B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, absorbs 3H<sub>2</sub>O
from damp air, still in the presence of water it always<a name="FNanchor_7_73" id="FNanchor_7_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_73" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> combines with
a less quantity of bases (borax only contains <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>6</sub>). However, fused boric
anhydride forms a crystalline compound with magnesium of the same
type as the hydrate (MgO)<sub>3</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Ebelmann), and even with sodium it
forms (Na<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or Na<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub> (Benedict). As a rule, the salts of
boric acid contain less base, although they are all able to form saline
compounds with bases when fused. Generally, vitreous fluxes are
formed by this means,<a name="FNanchor_8_74" id="FNanchor_8_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_74" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which when fused recall ordinary aqueous solutions
in many respects. Some of them crystallise on solidifying, and
then they have, like salts, a definite composition. The property of
boric anhydride of forming higher grades of combination with basic
oxides when fused explains the power of fused borax to dissolve metallic
oxides, and the experiments of Ebelmann on the preparation of artificial
crystals of the precious stones by means of boric anhydride. Boric
anhydride is, although with difficulty, volatile at a high temperature,
and therefore if it dissolves an oxide, it may be partially driven off from
such a solution by prolonged and powerful ignition; in which case
the oxides previously in solution separate out in a crystalline form,
and frequently in the same forms as those in which they occur in
nature&mdash;for example, crystals of alumina, which by itself fuses with
difficulty, have been obtained in this manner. It dissolves in
molten boric anhydride, and separates out in natural rhombohedric
crystals. In this way Ebelmann also obtained <i>spinel</i>&mdash;that is, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
compound of magnesium and aluminium oxides which occurs in
nature.<a name="FNanchor_9_75" id="FNanchor_9_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_75" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Free <i>boron</i> was obtained (1809) by Davy, Gay-Lussac, and Thénard
when they obtained the metals of the alkalis, for boric anhydride
when fused with sodium gives up its oxygen to the sodium, and free
boron is liberated as an <i>amorphous</i> powder like charcoal.<a name="FNanchor_10_76" id="FNanchor_10_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_76" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It is of a
brown colour, specific gravity 2·45 (Moissan), and when dry does not
alter in the air at the ordinary temperature; but it burns when ignited
to 700°, and in so doing combines not only with the oxygen of the air, but
also with the nitrogen. However, the combustion is never complete,
because the boric anhydride formed on the surface covers the remaining
mass of the boron, and so preserves it from the action of the
oxygen. Acids, even sulphuric (forming SO<sub>2</sub>) and phosphoric (forming
phosphorus), easily oxidise amorphous boron, especially when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
heated, converting it into boric acid. Alkalis have the same action
on it, only in this case hydrogen is evolved. Boron decomposes
steam at a red heat, also with evolution of hydrogen.</p>

<p>Amorphous boron, like charcoal, dissolves in certain molten metals.
The property of fused <i>aluminium of dissolving boron</i> in considerable
quantity is very striking; on cooling such a solution, the boron partially
combined with the aluminium separates out in a crystalline
form, and its properties are then exceedingly remarkable. The
crystalline boron may be obtained by heating (to 1,300°) the pulverulent
boron with aluminium in a well-closed crucible, the access of air
being prevented as far as possible. After cooling, crystals are observed
on the surface of the aluminium, and may easily be separated by dissolving
the latter in hydrochloric acid, which does not act on the crystals. The
specific gravity of the crystals is 2·68; they are partially transparent,
but are for the most part coloured dark brown; they contain about
4 p.c. of carbon and up to 7 p.c. of aluminium, so that they cannot
be considered as pure boron. Nevertheless, the properties of this
<i>crystalline</i> substance, which was obtained by Wöhler and Deville,
are very remarkable. It most closely resembles <i>the diamond in its
properties</i>&mdash;in fact, these crystals have the lustre and high refracting
power proper to the diamond only, whilst their hardness competes with
that of the diamond. Their powder polishes even the diamond, and like
the diamond scratches the sapphire and corundum. Crystalline boron is
much more stable with respect to chemical reagents than the amorphous
variety, and as it resembles the diamond, so amorphous boron, on the
other hand, distinctly recalls certain of the properties of charcoal; thus
a certain resemblance exists between boron and carbon in a free state,
which is further justified by the proximity of their positions in the
periodic system.</p>

<p>Among the other compounds of boron, those with nitrogen and
the halogens are the most remarkable. As already mentioned above,
amorphous boron combines directly with <i>nitrogen</i> at a red heat. If
it be heated in a glass tube in a stream of nitric oxide, perfect
combustion takes place, 5B + 3NO = B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3BN. If the residue
be treated with nitric acid, the boric anhydride dissolves, whilst the
<i>boron nitride</i> remains<a name="FNanchor_11_77" id="FNanchor_11_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_77" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> as an extremely light white powder, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
is sometimes partially crystalline and greasy to the touch, like talc. It
is infusible and unchanged, even at the melting-point of nickel. In
general, it is remarkable for its great stability with respect to chemical
reagents. Nitric and hydrochloric acids, as well as alkaline solutions,
and hydrogen and chlorine at a red heat, have no action on it.
When fused with potash, it evolves ammonia, and when ignited in
steam it also yields ammonia: 2BN + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2NH<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_12_78" id="FNanchor_12_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_78" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>No less remarkable is the compound of boron with fluorine&mdash;<i>boron
fluoride</i>, BF<sub>3</sub>. It is produced in many instances when compounds of
boron and of fluorine are brought together.<a name="FNanchor_13_79" id="FNanchor_13_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_79" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The most convenient
method of preparing it is by heating a mixture of calcium fluoride
with boric anhydride and sulphuric acid, 3CaF<sub>2</sub> + B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
= 3CaSO<sub>4</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 2BF<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_14_80" id="FNanchor_14_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_80" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It is a colourless liquefiable <i>gas</i> (the
liquid boils at -100°), which on coming into contact with damp air
forms white fumes, owing to its combining with water. One volume
of water dissolves as much as 1,050 volumes of this gas (Bazaroff),
forming a liquid which disengages boron fluoride when heated, and
distils over unaltered. Boron fluoride chars organic matter, owing to its
taking up the water from it, and in this respect it acts like sulphuric
acid. The behaviour of boron fluoride with water must be understood as
a reversible reaction, since with water it yields hydrofluoric and boric
acids, whilst they, acting on one another, re-form boron fluoride and
water. A state of equilibrium is set up between these four substances
(and between two reversible reactions) which is distinctly dependent
on the mass of the water.<a name="FNanchor_14_BIS_81" id="FNanchor_14_BIS_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_BIS_81" class="fnanchor">[14 bis]</a> When boron fluoride is in great excess,
the equilibrated system, which is capable of distilling over (sp. gr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of the liquid 1·77), has a composition BF<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O (or B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,6HF).
It has also its corresponding salts.<a name="FNanchor_15_82" id="FNanchor_15_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_82" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> It is a caustic liquid, having the
properties of a powerful acid; but it does not act on glass, which shows
that there is no free hydrofluoric acid present. Under the action of
water this system changes, with the formation of boric acid and
hydroborofluoric acid (HBF<sub>4</sub>) according to the equation 4BF<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
= 3HBF<sub>4</sub> + BH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_16_83" id="FNanchor_16_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_83" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> This hydroborofluoric acid has its
corresponding salts&mdash;for instance, KBF<sub>4</sub>. On evaporating the aqueous
solution this free acid decomposes, with the evolution of hydrofluoric
acid, and a stable system is again obtained: 2HBF<sub>4</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O
= B<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 2HF. The resultant solution (containing 2BF<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O,
sp. gr. 1·58), which is identical with that formed by the evaporation of
a solution of boric acid with hydrofluoric acid, again only contains
a compound of boron fluoride with water. Probably there are
various other possible and more or less stable states of equilibrium
and definite compounds of boron fluoride, hydrofluoric acid, and
water.</p>

<p>Nothing of this kind occurs with boron chloride, because hydrochloric
acid does not act on boric acid. However, amorphous boron
at 400° burns in chlorine, and at 410° forms <i>boron chloride</i>, BCl<sub>3</sub>.
The boron burns in the chlorine, forming a gas which, in a freezing
mixture, condenses into a liquid boiling at 17°, and gives up its excess
of chlorine, if there be any, to mercury. The specific gravity of this
liquid is 1·42 at 6°. Boron chloride may also be directly obtained
from boric anhydride by the simultaneous action of charcoal and
chlorine at a high temperature: B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3C + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> = 2BCl<sub>3</sub> + 3CO. It
is also obtained by the action of phosphoric chloride on boric anhydride
in a closed tube at 200° It is completely decomposed by
water, like the chloranhydride of an acid, boric acid being formed;
hence it fumes in the air: 2BCl<sub>3</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O = 2BH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 6HCl. Boron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
forms with bromine a similar compound, BBr<sub>3</sub>, specific gravity at
6° = 2·64, boiling at 90°. The vapour densities of the fluoride, chloride,
and bromide of boron show that they contain three atoms of the
halogen in the molecule&mdash;that is, that boron is a trivalent element
forming BX<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_16_BIS_84" id="FNanchor_16_BIS_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_BIS_84" class="fnanchor">[16 bis]</a></p>

<p>As in the first group lithium is followed by sodium, giving a more
basic oxide, so in the second group beryllium is followed by magnesium,
and so also in the third group there is, besides the lightest element,
boron, whose basic character is scarcely defined, <i>aluminium</i>, Al = 27,
whose oxide, alumina, has somewhat distinct basic properties, which,
although not so powerful as in magnesium oxide, are more distinct
than in boric anhydride. Among the elements of the third group,
aluminium is the most widely distributed in nature; it will be sufficient
to mention that it enters into the composition of clay to demonstrate
the universal distribution of aluminium in the earth's crust.</p>

<p>Alumina is so named from its being the metal of alums (<i>alumen</i>).</p>

<p><i>Clay</i>, which is so widely distributed and familiar to everybody, is
the insoluble residue obtained after the action of water containing
carbonic acid on many rocks, and especially on the felspars contained
in some of them. Felspar is a compound containing potash or soda,
alumina, and silica. The primary rocks, like granite, contain many
similar compounds (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_99">XVIII.</a>: Felspars). Felspar is acted
on by water containing carbonic acid, all the alkalis (potash and
soda), and a portion of the silica passing into the water as substances
which are soluble and carried away by it, whilst the alumina and
silica left from the felspar remain on the spot where the solution
has taken place. This is the original method of the formation of
clay in its primary deposits among rocks along whose crevices the
atmospheric water has permeated. Such primary deposits often contain
a white pure clay, termed <i>kaolin</i> or <i>porcelain clay</i>. But such clay is a
rarity, because the conditions for its formation are rarely met with.
The water, whilst acting chemically on rocks, at the same time destroys
them <i>mechanically</i>, and carries off the finely divided residues of disintegration
with it. Clay is most easily subjected to this mechanical
action of water, because it is composed of grains of exceedingly small
size and void of any visible crystalline structure, which easily remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
suspended in water. The cloudy water of running mountain
streams generally contains particles of clay in suspension, owing to the
above-described chemical and mechanical action of the water on the
minerals contained in the mountain rocks. Together with these
minute particles of clay the water carries away the coarser components
on which it is not able to act&mdash;for example, splinters of rock,
grains of mica, quartz, &amp;c. They were originally held together by
those minerals which form clay. When the water acts on these
binding minerals, a sandy mass is formed which water bears away.
The cloudy water in which the particles of clay and sand are held
in suspension carries them to, and deposits them at, the estuaries of
rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans. The coarser particles are first deposited
and form sand and similar disintegrated rocky matter, whilst the
clay, owing to its finely divided state, is carried on further, and is
only deposited in the still parts of the rivers, lakes, &amp;c. Such disintegrations
of rocks and separations of clay from sand have been
gradually going on during the millions of years of the earth's existence,
and are now proceeding, and have been the cause of the formation of
the immense deposits of sandstone and clay now forming a part of the
earth's strata. Such beds of clay may have been transferred by currents
and streams from one locality to another, so that we must distinguish
between primary and secondary deposits of clay. In places
these beds of clay have, owing to long exposure under water, and
perhaps partially owing to the action of heat, undergone compression,
and have formed the rocky masses known as clay slates and schists,
which sometimes form entire mountains. Roofing slates belong to this
class of rocks.</p>

<p>From what has been said above it will be evident that these
deposits can never consist of a chemically pure and homogeneous substance,
but will contain all kinds of extraneous insoluble finely divided
matter, and especially sand&mdash;that is, fragments of rock, chiefly quartz
(SiO<sub>2</sub>). It is, however, possible to considerably purify clay from
these impurities, owing to the fact that they are the result of
mechanical disintegration, whilst the clay has been formed as a residue
of the chemical alteration of rocky matter, and therefore its particles
are incomparably more minute than the particles of sand and other
rock fragments mixed with it. This difference in the size of the grains
causes the clay to remain longer in suspension when shaken up in water
than the coarser grains of sand. If clay be shaken up in water, and
especially if it be previously boiled in it, and if after the first portion
has settled the cloudy water be decanted, it will give a deposit of a
very much purer clay than the original. This method is employed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
purifying kaolin designed for the manufacture of the best kinds of
china, earthenware, &amp;c. A similar method is also employed in the investigation
of earths for determining the <i>composition of soils</i> chiefly
composed of a mixture of sand, clay, limestone, and mould. The
limestone is soluble in dilute acids, but neither the clay nor sand passes
into solution by this means, and therefore the limestone is easily
separated in the investigation of soils. The clay is separated from the
sand by a mechanical method similar to that described above, and
termed <i>levigation</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_85" id="FNanchor_17_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_85" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>By treating clay with strong sulphuric acid, which dissolves the
alumina in it, and then (by means of an alkaline carbonate) dissolving the
silica which was combined with the alumina in the clay (but not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
occurring in the form of sand, &amp;c., which is hardly dissolved by carbonate
of soda solution at all even on boiling), we may form an idea of
the proportion between the component parts of a clay; and by igniting
it at a high temperature, we may determine the amount of water held
in it. In the purer sorts of clay dried at 100° (sp. gr. of pure kaolin is
about 2·5) this proportion is about 2SiO<sub>2</sub> : 2H<sub>2</sub>O : Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. In this case
the conversion of felspar into kaolin is expressed by the equation:&mdash;</p>

<p>But as a rule clays contain from 45 to 60 p.c. of silica, from 20 to
30 p.c. of alumina, and about 12 p.c. of water; and it cannot be
supposed that clays are always homogeneous, because they are
an aggregation of residues (of silico-aluminous compounds) which
are unacted on by water. Nevertheless, clays always contain a
hydrous compound of alumina and silica, which is able to give up the
alumina contained by it as a base to strong sulphuric acid, forming
aluminium sulphate, which is soluble in water. After this treatment
the silica remains, and is soluble in a solution of an alkaline carbonate.<a name="FNanchor_18_86" id="FNanchor_18_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_86" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Clay is the source from which alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the majority of
the compounds of aluminium are prepared. Among these compounds
the most important are the alums&mdash;that is, the double sulphates of
potassium (and allied metals) and aluminium, AlK(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O. When
clay is treated with sulphuric acid diluted with a certain amount of
water, aluminium sulphate, Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, is formed; and if potassium
carbonate or sulphate be added to this solution, a double salt or
alum is obtained in solution. The alums crystallise easily, and are
prepared on a very large manufacturing scale owing to their being
employed in the process of dyeing. Alums are soluble in water, and,
on the addition of ammonia to their solutions, they give <i>hydrous
alumina</i>, or <i>aluminium hydroxide</i>, as a white gelatinous precipitate,
which is insoluble in water but easily soluble in acids, even when dilute,
and in aqueous soda or potash. The solubility of alumina in acids
indicates the basic character of the oxide, and its solubility in alkalis
and its power of forming compounds with them shows the weakness
of this basic character. However, the feeblest acids, even carbonic
acid, take up the alkali from such a solution, and the alumina then
separates out in a precipitate as the hydroxide. It must also be remembered
as characteristic of the salt-forming properties of alumina
that it does not combine with such feeble acids as carbonic, sulphurous,
or hypochlorous, &amp;c.&mdash;that is, its compounds with these acids are
decomposed by water. It is also important to observe that the
hydroxide is not soluble in aqueous ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Alumina</i>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, the anhydrous aluminium oxide&mdash;is
met with in nature, sometimes in a somewhat pure state, having
crystallised in transparent crystals, which are often coloured by impurities
(chromic, cobaltic, and ferric compounds). Such are the ruby
and sapphire, the former red and the latter blue. They have a specific
gravity 4·0, are distinguished by their very great hardness, which is
second only to that of the diamond, and they represent the purest
form of alumina. They are found in Ceylon and other islands of the
Indian Archipelago, embedded in a rock matrix.<a name="FNanchor_18_BIS_87" id="FNanchor_18_BIS_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_BIS_87" class="fnanchor">[18 bis]</a> <i>Corundum</i> is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
same crystallised anhydrous alumina coloured brown by a trace of
oxide of iron. A very much larger portion of this impurity occurs in
<i>emery</i>, which is found in crystalline masses in Asia Minor and in
Massachusetts, and owing to its extreme hardness is employed for
polishing stones and metals. In this anhydrous and crystalline state
the aluminium oxide is a substance which very powerfully resists the
action of reagents, and is insoluble both in solutions of the alkalis
and in strong acids. It is only capable of passing into solution after
being fused with alkalis.<a name="FNanchor_19_88" id="FNanchor_19_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_88" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Alumina may be obtained in this form by
artificial means if the hydroxide be ignited and then fused in the oxyhydrogen
flame.<a name="FNanchor_20_89" id="FNanchor_20_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_89" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Alumina also occurs in nature in combination with
water&mdash;as, for instance, in the rather rare minerals <i>hydrargillite</i>
(sp. gr. 2·3), Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O = 2Al(HO)<sub>3</sub>, and <i>diaspore</i>, Al<sub>2</sub>O_3,H<sub>2</sub>O
= 2AlO(HO) (sp. gr. 3·4). A less pure hydrate, mixed with ferric
oxide, sometimes occurs in masses (at Baux in the south of France) and
is termed <i>bauxite</i>; it contains Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O = Al<sub>2</sub>O(HO)<sub>4</sub> (sp. gr. 2·6).
When bauxite is ignited with sodium carbonate, carbonic anhydride
is liberated and the alumina then combines with the sodium oxide,
forming a saline aluminate of the oxides of aluminium and sodium.
This is taken advantage of in practice for the preparation of pure
alumina compounds on a large scale, for bauxite is found in large
masses (in the South of France, in Austria, and in Carolina in South
America), and the resultant compound of alumina and sodium
is soluble in water and does not contain ferric oxide. This solution
when subjected to the action of carbonic anhydride gives a precipitate
of aluminium hydroxide,<a name="FNanchor_21_90" id="FNanchor_21_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_90" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which with acids forms aluminium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
salts. If aqueous ammonia be added to a solution of aluminium
sulphate a gelatinous precipitate is formed, which at first remains
suspended in the liquid and then on settling forms a gelatinous mass,
which itself indicates the <i>colloidal property of aluminium hydroxide</i>.
The following points are characteristic of this colloidal state: (1) in an
anhydrous state such a colloidal substance is insoluble in water, as
alumina is; (2) in the hydrated state, it is gelatinous and insoluble in
water; and (3) it is also capable of existing in solutions, from which
it separates out in a non-crystalline state, forming a substance resembling
glue. These different states of colloids were distinguished by
Graham, who gave them the following very characteristic names. He
called the gelatinous form of the hydrate <i>hydrogel</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a gelatinous
hydrate, and the soluble form of the aqueous compound, <i>hydrosol</i>,
from the Latin for a soluble hydrate. Alumina readily and frequently
assumes these states. The gelatinous hydrate of alumina is its
hydrogel. It is, as has been already mentioned, insoluble in water,
and, like all similar hydrogels, shows not the faintest sign of crystallisation;
it is apt to vary in many of its properties with the amount of
water it contains, and loses its water on ignition, leaving a white
powder of the anhydrous oxide. The hydrogel of alumina is soluble
both in acids and alkalis. It may also be obtained by the evaporation
of its solutions in such feebly energetic acids as volatile acetic acid.
These properties are very frequently made use of in the arts, and
especially in <i>the processes of dyeing</i>, because the hydrogel of alumina
in precipitating attracts a number of colouring matters from their
solutions, the precipitate being thus coloured by the dyes attracted.<a name="FNanchor_22_91" id="FNanchor_22_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_91" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The preparation of fixed dyes and the employment of aluminous
compounds (mordants) in the processes of dyeing are founded on this
fact.<a name="FNanchor_23_92" id="FNanchor_23_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_92" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> When precipitated upon the fibres of tissues (calicoes, linens,
&amp;c.) the aluminium hydroxide renders them impermeable to water;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
this may be taken advantage of for the preparation of waterproof
tissues.</p>

<p><i>The hydrosol</i> of alumina&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the soluble aluminium hydroxide&mdash;is
more difficult to obtain.<a name="FNanchor_24_93" id="FNanchor_24_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_93" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In order to obtain this soluble variety of
alumina, Graham took a solution of its hydrogel in hydrochloric acid&mdash;that
is, a solution of aluminium chloride, which is able to dissolve a
still further quantity of the hydrogel of alumina, forming a basic salt
having probably one of the compositions Al(HO)Cl<sub>2</sub> or Al(HO)<sub>2</sub>Cl.
When such a solution, considerably diluted with water, is subjected to
dialysis&mdash;that is, to diffusion through a membrane<a name="FNanchor_25_94" id="FNanchor_25_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_94" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>&mdash;the hydrochloric
acid diffuses through the membrane and leaves the alumina in the
form of hydrosol. The resultant solution, even when only containing
two or three per cent. of alumina, passes into the hydrogel state with
such facility that it is sufficient to transfer it from one vessel to
another which has not been previously washed with water, for the
entire mass to solidify into a jelly. But a solution containing not
more than one-half per cent. of alumina may even be boiled without
coagulating; however, after the lapse of several days this solution will
of its own accord yield the hydrogel of alumina.<a name="FNanchor_25_BIS_95" id="FNanchor_25_BIS_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_BIS_95" class="fnanchor">[25 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>With respect to alumina as a base, it is very important to observe
that it is not only capable of combining with other bases<a name="FNanchor_26_96" id="FNanchor_26_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_96" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> but that
it does not give salts with feeble volatile acids (like carbonic and
hypochlorous); it forms salts which are easily decomposed by water,
especially when heated,<a name="FNanchor_27_97" id="FNanchor_27_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_97" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> as well as double and basic salts,<a name="FNanchor_28_98" id="FNanchor_28_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_98" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> <i>so that it
forms a clear example of a feeble base</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29_99" id="FNanchor_29_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_99" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> To these characteristics of
alumina we must add that it not only gives compounds of the type
AlX<sub>3</sub>, but also the polymeric type Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>, even when X is a simple
univalent haloid like chlorine. Deville and Troost showed (1857)
that the vapour density of aluminium chloride (at about 400°) is 9·37
with respect to air&mdash;that is, nearly 135 with respect to hydrogen, and
therefore the formula of its molecule is expressed by Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, and
not AlCl<sub>3</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_30_100" id="FNanchor_30_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_100" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> although in the case of boron, arsenic, and antimony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
which give oxides R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> of the same composition as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the
chlorine compounds form non-polymeric molecules, BCl<sub>3</sub>, AsCl<sub>3</sub>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
SbCl<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_31_101" id="FNanchor_31_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_101" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This duplication (polymerisation) of the form AlX<sub>3</sub> is connected
with the facility with which the salts of aluminium combine
with other salts to form double salts and with aluminium hydroxide
itself to form basic salts.</p>

<p><i>Aluminium sulphate</i>, Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which is obtained by treating clay
or the hydrates of alumina with sulphuric acid, crystallises in the cold
with 27H<sub>2</sub>O, or at the ordinary temperature in pearly crystals, which
are greasy to the touch and contain 16H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_32_102" id="FNanchor_32_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_102" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Its solutions act like sulphuric
acid&mdash;for instance, they evolve hydrogen with zinc, forming
basic salts, which are sometimes met with in nature (<i>aluminite</i>,
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,SO<sub>3</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O, <i>alumiane</i>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2SO<sub>3</sub>, and others), and may be obtained
by the decomposition of normal salts and by the direct solution of
the hydroxide in normal salts: these exhibit a varying composition,
(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub><i>m</i></sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><i>q</i></sub>, where <i>m/n</i> is less than 3. Aluminium sulphate
is now prepared (from the pure hydrate obtained from bauxite, Note
<a href="#Footnote_21_90">21</a>) in large quantities for dyeing purposes (instead of alums) as a
mordant. With solutions of the alkali sulphates (potassium, sodium,
ammonium, rubidium, and cæsium sulphates), the normal salt easily
forms double salts, termed <i>alums</i>&mdash;for example, the ordinary crystalline
alum contains KAl(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, or K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,24H<sub>2</sub>O. In the
ammonium alums (which leave a residue of alumina when ignited)
the potassium is replaced by ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub>). Alums are used
in large quantities, because there is scarcely any other salt which
crystallises so easily. In this respect the alums formed by potassium
and ammonium are equally convenient to purify, because they present
a considerable difference in their solubility at the ordinary
and higher temperatures. If the crystallisation be conducted rapidly,
the salt separates in minute crystals, but if it be slowly deposited,
especially in large masses, as in factories, then crystals several centimetres
long are sometimes obtained. At a higher temperature alums are very
much more soluble, and crystallise with greater difficulty, and are therefore
less easily freed from impurities; at 0° 100 parts of water dissolve
3 parts, at 30° 22 parts, at 70° 90 parts, and at 100° 357 parts of
potassium alum.<a name="FNanchor_33_103" id="FNanchor_33_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_103" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The solubility of ammonium alum is slightly less.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
The specific gravity of potassium alum is 1·74, of ammonium alum
1·63, and of sodium alum 1·60. Alums easily part with their water of
crystallisation; thus potash alum partially effloresces when exposed to
the air, and loses 9 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O under the receiver of an air-pump. At
100°, dry air passed over alums takes up nearly all their water. As
we have already mentioned (Chapter <a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>), the law of isomorphous substitutions
exhibits itself more clearly in the alums than in any other
salts, and all alums not only contain the same amount of water of
crystallisation, MR(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O (where M = K, NH<sub>4</sub>, Na; R = Al,
Fe, Cr), and appear in crystals whose planes are inclined at equal
angles, but they also give every possible kind of isomorphous mixture.
The aluminium in them is easily replaced by iron, chromium, indium
and sometimes by other metals, whilst the potassium may be substituted
by sodium, rubidium, ammonium, and thallium, and the
sulphuric acid may be replaced by selenic and chromic acids.</p>

<p><i>Aluminium chloride</i>, Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, is obtained, like other similar chlorides,
(for instance MgCl<sub>2</sub>) either directly from chlorine and the metal, or by heating
to redness an intimate mixture of the amorphous anhydrous oxide and
charcoal in a stream of dry chlorine.<a name="FNanchor_33_BIS_104" id="FNanchor_33_BIS_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_BIS_104" class="fnanchor">[33 bis]</a> The resultant sublimate is very
volatile,<a name="FNanchor_34_105" id="FNanchor_34_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_105" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and forms a crystalline, easily fusible mass, which deliquesces
in the air and easily dissolves in water, with the evolution of a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
amount of heat.<a name="FNanchor_34_BIS_106" id="FNanchor_34_BIS_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_BIS_106" class="fnanchor">[34 bis]</a> On evaporating this solution, hydrochloric acid
and aluminium hydroxide are liberated. But if the solution be
heated in a closed tube, with an excess of hydrochloric acid, then, on
cooling, crystals of AlCl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O are obtained&mdash;that is, aluminium
chloride both combines with water and is decomposed by it. And the
faculty of the type AlX<sub>3</sub> for combining with other molecules is seen in
the compounds of AlCl<sub>3</sub> with many other chlorine compounds. Thus,
for example, a mixture of aluminium chloride with sulphur tetrachloride
gives Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,SCl<sub>4</sub>, under the action of chlorine, whilst with phosphorus
pentachloride it forms AlCl<sub>3</sub>,PCl<sub>5</sub>; it also combines with NOCl. Thus,
the compounds AlCl<sub>3</sub>,NOCl, AlCl<sub>3</sub>,POCl<sub>3</sub>, AlCl<sub>3</sub>,3NH<sub>3</sub>, AlCl<sub>3</sub>,KCl,
AlCl<sub>3</sub>,NaCl are known.<a name="FNanchor_35_107" id="FNanchor_35_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_107" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The compound of aluminium and sodium
chlorides, AlNaCl<sub>4</sub>, is very fusible and much more stable in the air
than aluminium chloride itself. It seems to be of the same type as
the alums. This compound, AlNaCl<sub>4</sub>, is employed in the extraction
of metallic aluminium, as we shall presently proceed to describe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Aluminium bromide, which is obtained by the direct combination of
metallic aluminium with bromine, closely resembles the chloride; it
melts at 90°, volatilises at 270°, and its vapour density indicates the
formula Al<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>6</sub>. Aluminium iodide is obtained by heating iodine with
finely divided aluminium in a closed tube; it is so easily decomposed
by oxygen that its vapour even explodes when mixed with it.<a name="FNanchor_36_108" id="FNanchor_36_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_108" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><i>Metallic Aluminium</i> was first prepared by Wöhler in 1822 as
a grey powder by the action of potassium on aluminium chloride.
He afterwards (in 1845) obtained it as a white compact metal,
unoxidisable in the air, and only slowly attacked by acids. Owing
to the vast and wide occurrence of clay, many efforts have been made
in investigating in detail the methods for the extraction of this metal.
These efforts were brought to a successful issue (1854) by Sainte-Claire
Deville, who is also renowned for his doctrine of dissociation. Experiments
on a large scale have proved that metallic aluminium, although
possessed of great lightness, strength, and durability, is not so generally
suitable for technical purposes as was at first thought. Nitric and many
other acids, indeed, do not act on it, but the alkalis, alkaline substances,
and even salts&mdash;for instance, moist table salt&mdash;humidity, &amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_36_BIS_109" id="FNanchor_36_BIS_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_BIS_109" class="fnanchor">[36 bis]</a> tarnish
it, and hence objects made of aluminium suffer at the surfaces, alter,
and cannot, as was hoped, replace the precious metals, from which it
differs in its extreme lightness. But the alloys made with aluminium
(especially with copper, for example aluminium bronze) are very
valuable in their properties and applications.</p>

<p>The Deville method for the preparation of metallic aluminium is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
based on the decomposition of the above-mentioned compound of
sodium and aluminium chlorides by metallic sodium. The compound
is obtained by passing the vapour of aluminium chloride (evolved from
a mixture of alumina, extracted from bauxite or cryolite, with
charcoal ignited in a stream of chlorine) over red-hot salt, when the
compound AlNaCl<sub>4</sub>, is itself volatilised, and may in this manner be
obtained pure. A mixture of this compound with salt and fluor spar,
or with cryolite, is heated with a certain excess of sodium, cut into
small lumps. On a large scale this operation is carried on in special
furnaces with a small access of air and at a high temperature. The decomposition
takes place chiefly according to the equation NaAlCl<sub>4</sub> + 3Na
= 4NaCl + Al. Neither charcoal nor zinc will reduce the oxygen
compounds of aluminium; even sodium and potassium do not act on
alumina. Moreover, metallic aluminium, like magnesium, is able to
reduce even the metals of the alkalis from their oxygen compounds.
This is connected with the fact that the atom of oxygen evolves
more heat in combining with Al (and Mg) than it does in combining with
other metals; whilst on the other hand, chlorine (and the other halogens)
evolve more heat in combining with the metals of the alkalis.<a name="FNanchor_36_TRI_110" id="FNanchor_36_TRI_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_TRI_110" class="fnanchor">[36 tri]</a></p>

<p>Since the close of the eighties the metallurgy of aluminium has
taken a new direction, based upon the action of an electric current
upon cryolite at a high temperature,<a name="FNanchor_37_111" id="FNanchor_37_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_111" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and the solution of oxide of
aluminium (obtained from bauxite or in the form of corundum) in
it; under these conditions metallic aluminium is reduced at the
negative pole (cathode) in a sufficiently pure state, and if the cathode
be copper, forms alloys with it. Such are Hall's and Cowle's (both in
the United States) and the Neuhausen process (where the current is
obtained from a dynamo worked by the Falls of the Rhine at Schaffhausen).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
As an example, we will describe (in the words of Prof. D. P.
Konovaloff, who became acquainted with this process at the Chicago
Exhibition), Hall's process as applied near Pittsburg, where it gives
about 1,500 kilos of Al a day. An iron box (about 1 metre long and
&frac12; metre wide), provided with a well rammed down charcoal lining, is
charged with a mixture of cryolite and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (from bauxite), over
which salt is strewn, and a current of 5,000 ampères at 20 volts is
passed through the mixture. The anode is composed of a carbon cylinder
(about 9 cm. in diameter), while the charcoal lining forms the cathode.
When the temperature inside the box is raised to a red heat by the
current, the mixture fuses and the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> begins to decompose. The
Al liberated collects at the bottom of the box, whilst the oxygen
evolved burns the charcoal anode. When the decomposition is at
an end, and the resistance of the mass increases, a fresh quantity of
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is added, and this is continued until the amount of impurities
accumulated in the furnace and passing into the metal becomes too
great.<a name="FNanchor_37_BIS_112" id="FNanchor_37_BIS_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_BIS_112" class="fnanchor">[37 bis]</a></p>

<p>Aluminium has a white colour resembling that of tin&mdash;that is, it is
greyer than silver and has the feebly dull lustre of tin, but compared to
tin and pure silver, aluminium is very hard. Its density is 2·67&mdash;that
is, it is nearly four times lighter than silver and three times lighter
than copper. It melts at an incipient red heat (600°), and in so doing
is but slightly oxidised. At the ordinary temperature it does not alter
in the air, and in a compact mass it burns with great difficulty at a
white heat, but in thin sheets, into which it may be rolled, or as a very
fine wire, it burns with a brilliant white light, since it forms an infusible
and non-volatile oxide. Aluminium itself is non-volatile at a
furnace heat. These properties render Al a very good reducing agent,
and N. N. Beketoff showed that it reduces the oxides of the alkali
metals (Chapter XIII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_42_BIS_825">42 bis</a>). Dilute sulphuric acid has scarcely
any action on it, but the strong acid dissolves it, especially with the aid
of heat. Nitric acid, dilute or strong, has no action whatever on it. On
the other hand, hydrochloric acid dissolves aluminium with great ease,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
as do also solutions of caustic soda and potash. In the latter cases
hydrogen is evolved.<a name="FNanchor_38_113" id="FNanchor_38_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_113" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Aluminium forms alloys with different metals with great ease.
Among them the copper alloy is of practical use. It is called
<i>aluminium bronze</i>. This alloy is prepared by dissolving 11 p.c.
by weight of metallic aluminium in molten copper at a white
heat. The formation of the alloy is accompanied by the development
of a considerable quantity of heat, so that it glows to a bright white
heat. This alloy, which corresponds with the formula AlCu<sub>3</sub>, presents
an exceedingly homogeneous mass, especially if perfectly pure
copper be taken. It is distinguished for its capacity to fill up the
most minute impressions of the mould into which it may be cast,
and by its extraordinary elasticity and toughness, so that objects cast
from it may be hammered, drawn, &amp;c., and at the same time it is fine-grained
and exceedingly hard, takes an excellent polish, and, what is
most important, its surface then remains almost unchangeable in the
air, and has a colour and lustre which may be compared to that of gold
alloys. Hence aluminium bronze is much used in the arts for making
spoons, watches, vessels, forks, knives, and for ornaments, &amp;c. No
less important is the fact that the admixture of one-thousandth part
of aluminium with steel renders its castings homogeneous (free from
cavities) to an extent that could not be arrived at by other means, nor
does the quality of the steel in any respect deteriorate by this admixture,
but rather is it improved. In a pure state, aluminium is only
employed for such objects as require the hardness of metals with
comparative lightness, such as telescopes and various physical apparatus
and small articles.</p>

<p>According to the periodic system of the elements, the analogues of
magnesium are zinc, cadmium, and mercury in the second group. So
also in the third group, to which aluminium belongs, we find its corresponding
analogues <i>gallium</i>, <i>indium</i>, and <i>thallium</i>. They are all three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
so rarely and sparingly met with in nature that they could only be
discovered by means of the spectroscope. This fact shows that they
are partially volatile, as should be the case according to the property
of their nearest neighbours, the very volatile zinc, cadmium and mercury.
As with them, in gallium, indium, and thallium the density of
the metal, decomposability of compounds, &amp;c., rises with the atomic
weight. But here we find a peculiarity which does not exist in the
second group. In the latter, the fusibility increases with the atomic
weight of magnesium, zinc, cadmium, and mercury; indeed, the
heaviest metal&mdash;mercury&mdash;is a liquid. In the third group it is not so.
In order to understand this it is sufficient to turn our attention to
the elements of the further groups of the uneven series&mdash;for instance,
to group V., containing phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony, or to
group VI., with sulphur, selenium, and tellurium, and also to
group VII., where chlorine, bromine and iodine are situated. In
all these instances the fusibility decreases with a rise of atomic
weight; the members of the higher series, the elements of a high
atomic weight, fuse with greater difficulty than the lighter elements.
The representatives of the uneven series of group III., aluminium,
gallium, indium, thallium, forming, as they do, a transition, all show
an intermediate behaviour. Here the most fusible of all is the medium
metal gallium,<a name="FNanchor_38_BIS_114" id="FNanchor_38_BIS_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_BIS_114" class="fnanchor">[38 bis]</a> which fuses at the heat of the hand; whilst indium,
thallium, and aluminium fuse at much higher temperatures.</p>

<p>Zinc (group II.), which has an atomic weight 65, should be followed
in group III. by an element with an atomic weight of about 69. It
will be in the same group as Al and should consequently give R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
RCl<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, alums and similar compounds analogous to those of
aluminium. Its oxide should be more easily reducible to metal than
alumina, just as zinc oxide is more easily reduced than magnesia. The
oxide R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> should, like alumina, have feeble but clearly expressed
basic properties. The metal reduced from its compounds should have a
greater atomic volume than zinc, because in the fifth series, proceeding
from zinc to bromine, the volume increases. And as the volume of
zinc = 9·2, and of arsenic = 18, that of our metal should be
near to 12. This is also evident from the fact that the volume of
aluminium = 11, and of indium = 14, and our metal is situated in
group III., between aluminium and indium. If its volume = 11·5<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and its atomic weight be about 69, then its density will be nearly 5·9.
The fact that zinc is more volatile than magnesium gives reason for
thinking that the metal in question will be more volatile than
aluminium, and therefore for expecting its discovery by the aid of
the spectroscope, &amp;c.</p>

<p>These properties were indicated by me for the analogue of aluminium
in 1871, and I named it (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>) eka-aluminium.
In 1875, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who had done much work in spectrum
analysis, discovered a new metal in a zinc blende from the Pyrenees
(Pierrefitte). He recognised its individuality and difference from
zinc, cadmium, indium, and the other companions of zinc by means of
the spectroscope; but he only obtained some fractions of a centigram
of it in a free state. Consequently only a few of its reactions were
determined, as, for instance, that barium carbonate precipitates the new
oxide from its salts (alumina, as is known, is also precipitated). Lecoq
de Boisbaudran named the newly discovered metal <i>gallium</i>. As one
would expect the same properties for eka-aluminium as were observed
in gallium, I pointed out this fact at the time in the Memoirs of the
Paris Academy of Sciences. All the subsequent observations of Lecoq
de Boisbaudran confirmed the identity between the properties of gallium
and those indicated for eka-aluminium. Immediately after this the
ammonium alum of gallium was obtained, but the most convincing proof
of all was found in the fact that the density of gallium although
first apparently different (4·7) from that indicated above, afterwards,
when the metal was carefully purified from sodium (which was first
used as a reducing agent), proved to be just that (5·9) which would
have been looked for in the analogue of aluminium; and, what
was very important, the equivalent (23·3) and atomic weight (69·8)
determined by the specific heat (0·08) were shown by experiment
to be such as would be expected. These facts confirmed the
universality and applicability of the periodic system of the elements.
It must be remarked that previous to it there was no means of either
foretelling the properties or even the existence of undiscovered
elements.<a name="FNanchor_39_115" id="FNanchor_39_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_115" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Much more light has been thrown on that element of the aluminium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
group which follows after cadmium (its position in the periodic system
is III., 7, that is, it is in group III. in the 7th series). This is
<i>indium</i>, In, which also occurs in small quantities in certain zinc ores.
It was discovered (1863) by Reich and Richter (and more fully investigated
by Winkler) in the Freiberg zinc ores, and was named indium
from the fact that it gives to the flame of a gas-burner a blue coloration,
owing to the indigo blue spectral lines proper to it. The equivalent
(<i>see</i> Chapter XV., Note <a href="#Footnote_15_19">15</a>), specific heat, and other properties
of the metal confirm the atomic weight In = 113.<a name="FNanchor_40_116" id="FNanchor_40_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_116" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Inasmuch as we found among the analogues of magnesium in
group II. a metal, mercury, heavier and more easily reduced than
the rest, and giving two grades of oxidation, so we should expect to
find a metal among the analogues of aluminium in group III. which
would be heavy, easily reduced, and give two grades of oxidation, and
would have an atomic weight greater than 200. Such is <i>thallium</i>.
It forms compounds of a lower type, TlX, besides the higher unstable
type TlX<sub>3</sub>, just as mercury gives HgX<sub>2</sub> and HgX. In the form of
the thallic oxide, Tl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the base is but feebly energetic, as would be
expected by analogy with the oxides Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, whilst
in thallous oxide, Tl<sub>2</sub>O, the basic properties are sharply defined,
as might be expected according to the properties of the type R<sub>2</sub>O
(Chapter <a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>). <i>Thallium</i> was discovered in 1861 by Crookes and by
Lamy in certain pyrites. When pyrites are employed in the manufacture
of sulphuric acid, they are burned, and give besides sulphurous
anhydride the vapours of various substances which accompany the
sulphur, and are volatile. Among these substances arsenic and
selenium are found, and together with them, thallium. These substances
accumulate in a more or less considerable quantity in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
tubes through which the vapours formed in the combustion of the
pyrites have to pass. When the methods of spectrum analysis were
discovered (1860), a great number of substances were subjected to
spectroscopic research, and it was observed that those sublimations
which are obtained in the combustion of certain pyrites contained an
element having a very sharply-defined and characteristic spectrum&mdash;namely,
in the green portion of the spectra it gave a well-defined band
(wave-length 535 millionth millimetres) which did not correspond with
any then known element.<a name="FNanchor_41_117" id="FNanchor_41_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_117" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Under the action of a galvanic current solutions of thallium salts
deposit the metal in the form of a heavy powder. It is of a grey colour
like tin, is soft like sodium, and has a metallic lustre. Its specific
gravity is 11·8, it melts at 290°, and volatilises at a high temperature.
When heated slightly above its melting point it forms an insoluble
(in water) higher oxide, Tl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, as a dark-coloured powder, generally
however accompanied by the lower oxide Tl<sub>2</sub>O, which is also black
but soluble in water and alcohol. This solution has a distinctly
alkaline reaction. This <i>thallous oxide</i>, melts at 300°, and is easily
obtained from the hydroxide TlHO by igniting it without access of
air (in the presence of air the incandescent thallous oxide partly passes
into thallic oxide). <i>Thallous hydroxide</i>, TlOH, crystallises with one
molecule H<sub>2</sub>O in yellow prisms which are very easily soluble in water.
Metallic thallium may be used for its preparation, as the metal in the
presence of water attracts oxygen from the air and forms the hydroxide.
But metallic thallium does not decompose water, although it gives
a hydroxide which is soluble in water.<a name="FNanchor_41_BIS_118" id="FNanchor_41_BIS_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_BIS_118" class="fnanchor">[41 bis]</a> All the other data for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
chemical and physical properties of thallium, of its two grades of oxidation
and of their corresponding salts, are expressed by the position
occupied by this metal in virtue of its atomic weight Tl = 204, between
mercury Hg = 200, and lead Pb = 206.</p>

<p>Gallium, indium, and thallium belong to the uneven series, and there
should be elements of the even series in group III. corresponding
with calcium, strontium, and barium in group II. These elements
should in their oxides R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> present basic characters of a more
energetic kind than those shown by alumina, just as calcium,
strontium, and barium give more energetic bases than magnesium, zinc,
and cadmium. Such are <i>yttrium</i> and <i>ytterbium</i>, which occur in a
rare Swedish mineral called <i>gadolinite</i>, and are therefore termed
the gadolinite metals. To these belong also the metal <i>lanthanum</i>,
which accompanies the two other metals <i>cerium</i> and <i>didymium</i> in
the mineral <i>cerite</i>, and it therefore belongs to the cerite metals. All
these metals and certain others accompanying them, give basic oxides
R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. At first their formula was supposed to be RO, but the
application of the periodic system required their being counted as
elements of groups III. and IV., which was also confirmed by
the determination of the specific heats of these metals,<a name="FNanchor_42_119" id="FNanchor_42_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_119" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
still by the fact that Nilson and Clève, in their researches on the
gadolinite metals (1879), discovered that they contain a peculiar and
very rare element, <i>scandium</i>, which by the magnitude of its atomic
weight, Sc = 44, and in all its properties, exactly corresponds with the
metal (previously foretold on the basis of the periodic system) <i>ekaboron</i>,
whose properties were determined by taking the cerite and gadolinite
metals as forming oxides R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_43_120" id="FNanchor_43_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_120" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The brevity of this work and the great rarity of the above-mentioned
elements will give me the right to exclude their description, all the
more as the principles of the periodic system enable many of their
properties to be foreseen, and as their practical uses (cerium oxalate is
used in medicine, and didymium oxide in the manufacture of glass, a
mixture of the oxides of lanthanum and similar metals is employed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a><br /><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>

when brought to incandescence) are very limited, by reason of their
great rarity in nature, and the difficulty of separating them from one
another.</p>

and the lakes of Thibet about 1,000 tons per annum), or by heating native calcium borate (<i>see</i>
Note <a href="#Footnote_2_67">2</a>) with sodium carbonate (about 4,000 tons per annum), or it is obtained (up to 2,000
tons) from the Tuscan impure boric acid and sodium carbonate (carbonic anhydride is
evolved). Borax gives supersaturated solutions with comparative ease (Gernez), from
which it crystallises, both at the ordinary and higher temperatures, in octahedra, containing
Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O. Its sp. gr. is 1·81. But if the crystallisation proceeds in open
vessels, then at temperatures below 56°, the ordinary prismatic crystallo-hydrate
B<sub>4</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O is obtained. Its sp. gr. is 1·71, it effloresces in dry air at the ordinary
temperature, and at 0° 100 parts of water dissolve about 8 parts of this crystallo-hydrate,
at 50° 27 parts, and at 100° 201 parts. Borax fuses when heated, loses its water and
gives an anhydrous salt which at a red heat fuses into a mobile liquid and solidifies into
a transparent amorphous <i>glass</i> (sp. gr. 2·37), which before hardening acquires the pasty
condition peculiar to common molten glass. Molten borax dissolves many oxides and on
solidifying acquires characteristic tints with the different oxides; thus oxide of cobalt gives
a dark blue glass, nickel a yellow, chromium a green, manganese an amethyst, uranium
a bright yellow, &amp;c. Owing to its fusibility and property of dissolving oxides,
borax is employed in soldering and brazing metals. Borax frequently enters into the
composition of strass and fusible glasses.</p></div>

solutions many salts are carried off by the vapour&mdash;for instance, if a solution of potash
containing about 17&ndash;20 grams of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> per litre be boiled, about 5 milligrams of salt are
carried off for every litre of water evaporated. With Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> the amount of salt carried
over is infinitesimal, and with Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> it is half that given by K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. The volatilisation
of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> under these circumstances is incomparably greater&mdash;for instance, when a
solution containing 14 grams of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> per litre is boiled, every litre of water evaporated
carries over about 350 milligrams of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. When Chigeffsky passed steam through a
tube containing B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at 400°, it carried over so much of this substance that the flame
of a Bunsen's burner into which the steam was led gave a distinct green coloration; but
when, instead of steam, air was passed through the tube there was no coloration whatever.
By placing a tube with a cold surface in steam containing B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Chigeffsky
obtained a crystalline deposit of the hydrate B(OH)<sub>3</sub> on the surface of the tube.
Besides this, he found that the amount of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> carried over by steam increases with the
temperature, and that crystals of B(OH)<sub>3</sub> placed in an atmosphere of steam (although
perfectly still) volatilise, which shows that this is not a matter of mechanical transfer,
but is based on the capacity of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and B(OH)<sub>3</sub> to pass into a state of vapour in an
atmosphere of steam.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_70" id="Footnote_4_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_70"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> How it is that these vapours containing boric acid are formed in the interior of the
earth is at present unknown. Dumas supposes that it depends on the presence of <i>boron
sulphide</i>, B<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> (others think boron nitride), at a certain depth in the earth. This substance
may be artificially prepared by heating a mixture of boric acid and charcoal in a
stream of carbon bisulphide vapour, and by the direct combination of boron and the
vapour of sulphur at a white heat. The almost non-crystalline compound B<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, sp. gr.
1·55, thus obtained is somewhat volatile, has an unpleasant smell, and is very easily decomposed
by water, forming boric acid and hydrogen sulphide, B<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>S.
It is supposed that a bed of boron sulphide lying at a certain depth below the surface of
the earth comes into contact with sea water which has percolated through the upper
strata, becomes very hot, and gives steam, hydrogen sulphide, and boric acid. This also
explains the presence of ammonia in the vapours, because the sea water certainly passes
through crevices containing a certain amount of animal matter, which is decomposed
by the action of heat and evolves ammonia. There are several other hypotheses for explaining
the presence of the vapours of boric acid, but owing to the want of other known
localities the comparison of these hypotheses is at present hardly possible. The
amount of boric anhydride in the vapours which escape from the Tuscan fumerolles and
suffioni is very inconsiderable, less than one-tenth per cent., and therefore the direct extraction
of the acid would be very uneconomical, hence the heat contained in the discharged
vapours is made use of for evaporating the water. This is done in the following manner.
Reservoirs are constructed over the crevices evolving the vapours, and the water of
some neighbouring spring is passed into them. The vapours are caused to pass through
these reservoirs, and in so doing they give up all their boric acid to the water and heat
it, so that after about twenty-four hours it even boils; still this water only forms a very
weak solution of boric acid. This solution is then passed into lower basins and again
saturated by the vapours discharged from the earth, by which means a certain amount
of the water is evaporated and a fresh quantity of boric acid absorbed; the same process
is repeated in another reservoir, and so on until the water has collected a somewhat
considerable amount of boric acid. The solution is drawn from the last reservoir <span class="smcap">A</span> into
settling vessels <span class="smcap">B</span> <span class="smcap">D</span>, and then into a series of vessels <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>. In these vessels, which are
made of lead, the solution is also evaporated by the vapours escaping from the earth,
and attains a density of 10° to 11° Baumé. It is allowed to settle in the vessel <span class="smcap">C</span>, in which
it cools and crystallises, yielding (not quite pure) crystalline boric acid. At temperatures
above 100°, for instance, with superheated steam, boric acid volatilises with steam very
easily.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_71" id="Footnote_5_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_71"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Metals, like Na, K, Li, give salts of the type of borax, MBO<sub>2</sub> or MH<sub>2</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>. A
solution of borax, Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, has an alkaline reaction, decomposes ammonia salts with the
liberation of ammonia (Bolley), absorbs carbonic anhydride like an alkali, dissolves
iodine like an alkali (Georgiewics), and seems to be decomposed by water. Thus Rose
showed that strong solutions of borax give a precipitate of silver borate with silver
nitrate, whilst dilute solutions precipitate silver oxide, like an alkali. Georgiewics
even supposes (1888) boric anhydride to be entirely void of acid properties; for all acids,
on acting on a mixture of solutions of potassium iodide and iodate, evolve iodine, but
boric acid does not do this. With dilute solutions of sodium hydroxide Berthelot obtained
a development of heat equal to 11&frac12; thousand calories per equivalent of alkali (40
grams sodium hydroxide) when the ratio Na<sub>2</sub>O : 2B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (as in borax) was taken, and only
4 thousand calories when the ratio was Na<sub>2</sub>O : B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, whence he concludes that water
powerfully decomposes those sodium borates in which there is more alkali than in borax.
Laurent (1849) obtained a sodium compound, Na<sub>2</sub>O,4B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, containing twice as
much boric anhydride as borax, by boiling a mixture of borax with an equivalent
quantity of sal-ammoniac until the evolution of ammonia entirely ceased.</p>

<p>Hence it is evident that feeble acids are as prone to, and as easily, form acid salts
(that is, salts containing much acid oxide) as feeble bases are to give basic salts. These
relations become still clearer on an acquaintance with such feeble acids as silicic,
molybdic, &amp;c. This variety of the proportions in which bases are able to form salts recalls
exactly the variety of the proportions in which water combines with crystallo-hydrates.
But the want of sufficient data in the study of these relations does not yet permit of
their being generalised under any common laws.</p>

<p>With respect to the feeble acid energy of boric anhydride I think it useful to add the
following remarks. Carbonic anhydride is absorbed by a solution of borax, and displaces
boric anhydride; but it is also displaced by it, not only on fusion, but also on
solution, as the preparation of borax itself shows. Sulphuric anhydride is absorbed by
boric acid, forming a compound B(HSO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, where HSO<sub>4</sub> is the radicle of sulphuric acid
(D'Ally). With phosphoric acid, boric acid forms a stable compound, BPO<sub>4</sub>, or
B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, undecomposable by water, as Gustavson and others have shown. With
respect to tartaric acid, boric anhydride is able to play the same part as antimonious
oxide. Mannitol, glycerol, and similar polyhydric alcohols also seem able to form particularly
characteristic compounds with boric anhydride. All these aspects of the subject
require still further explanation by a method of fresh and detailed research.</p></div>

fact in all probability determines both the amount of water in the salts of boric acid as
well as their decomposition by an excess of water. In confirmation of the above-mentioned
competing action between water and bases, I think it useful to point out
that the crystallo-hydrate of borax containing 5H<sub>2</sub>O may be represented as B(HO)<sub>3</sub>, or
rather as B<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>, with the substitution of one atom of hydrogen by sodium, since
Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O = 2B<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>5</sub>(ONa). The composition of the acid boric salts is very varied,

feeble acids, like silica, phosphoric and boric anhydrides, &amp;c., which themselves give
glassy masses, like quartz, glacial phosphoric acid, and boric anhydride. They are able,
like aqueous solutions and like metallic alloys, to solidify either in an amorphous form
or to yield (or even be wholly converted into) definite crystalline compounds. This view
illustrates the position of solutions amongst the other chemical compounds, and allows
all alloys to be regarded from the aspect of the common laws of chemical reactions. I
have therefore frequently recurred to it in this work, and have since the year 1850
introduced it into various provinces of chemistry.</p></div>

and easily displaced from its salts by other acids, yet in an anhydrous state, as anhydride,
it exhibits the properties of an energetic acid oxide, and it <i>displaces</i> the anhydrides of
other acids. This of course does not mean that the acid then acquires new chemical
properties, but only depends on the fact that the anhydrides of the majority of acids are
much more volatile than boric anhydride, and therefore the salts of many acids&mdash;even of
sulphuric acid&mdash;are decomposed when fused with boric anhydride.</p>

<p>By itself boric acid is used in the arts in small quantity, chiefly for the preservation
of meat and fish (which must be afterwards well washed in water) and of milk, and for
soaking the wicks of stearin candles; the latter application is based on the fact that
the wicks, which are made of cotton twist, contain an ash which is infusible by itself but

Reaction proceeds rapidly; the mass is stirred with an iron rod, and poured directly into

of sodium borate, which is dissolved, together with the salt, by the water, whilst the
boron settles at the bottom of the vessel as an insoluble powder. It is washed in water,
and dried at the ordinary temperature. Magnesium, and even charcoal and phosphorus,
are also able to reduce boron from its oxide. Boron, in the form of an amorphous powder,
very easily passes through filter-paper, remains suspended in water, and colours it brown,
so that it appears to be soluble in water. Sulphur precipitated from solutions shows the
same (colloidal) property. When borax is fused with magnesium powder, it gives a brown
powder of a compound of boron and magnesium, Mg<sub>2</sub>B (Winkler, 1890), but when a
mixture of 1 part of magnesium and 3 parts of B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is heated to redness (Moissan, 1892),
it forms amorphous boron in the form of a chestnut-coloured powder, which, after being
washed with water, hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, is fused again with B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in an
atmosphere of hydrogen in order to prevent the access of the nitrogen of the air, which
is easily absorbed by incandescent amorphous boron.</p>

<p>Sabatier (1891) considers that a certain amount of gaseous hydride of boron is evolved
in the action of hydrochloric acid upon the alloys of magnesium and boron, because the
gas disengaged burns with a green flame. Still, the existence of hydride of boron cannot
be regarded as certain.</p>

<p>Under the action of the heat of the electric furnace boron forms with carbon a
<i>carbide</i>, BC, as Mühlhäuser and Moissan showed in 1893.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_77" id="Footnote_11_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_77"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> At first boron nitride was obtained by heating boric acid with potassium cyanide
or other cyanogen compounds. It may be more simply prepared by heating anhydrous
borax with potassium ferrocyanide, or by heating borax with ammonium chloride. For
this purpose one part of borax is intimately mixed with two parts of dry ammonium
chloride, and the mixture heated in a platinum crucible. A porous mass is formed, which
after crushing and treating with water and hydrochloric acid, leaves boron nitride. <i>Boron
fluoride</i>, BF, is known, corresponding to BN; this body was obtained by Besson and
Moissan (1891). The action of phosphorus upon iodide of boron, BI<sub>3</sub>, forms PBI<sub>2</sub>, and
when heated to 500° in hydrogen it forms BP, which gives PH<sub>3</sub> with fused KHO.</p></div>

+ NH<sub>3</sub> - 2H<sub>2</sub>O = BN. The same is expressed by saying that boron nitride is a compound
of the type of the boron compounds BX<sub>3</sub>, with the substitution of X<sub>3</sub> by nitrogen, as the

nature containing both boron and fluorine. If calcium fluoride is heated with boric
anhydride, calcium borate and boron fluoride are formed, and the latter, as a gas, is
volatilised: 2B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3CaF<sub>2</sub> = 2BF<sub>3</sub> + Ca<sub>3</sub>B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. The calcium borate, however, retains a
certain amount of calcium fluoride.</p></div>

be carried on in glass vessels, which contain silica, but in lead or platinum vessels.
Boron fluoride by itself does not corrode glass, but the hydrofluoric acid liberated in the
reaction may bring a part of the silica into reaction. Boron fluoride should be collected
over mercury, as water acts on it, as we shall see afterwards.</p></div>

apparently contradictory results of different investigators, especially those of Gay-Lussac
(and Thénard), Davy, Berzelius, and Bazaroff. In the form in which the reaction of BF<sub>3</sub>
on water is given here, it is evident that the act of solution in water is accompanied by
complex but direct chemical transformations, and I think that this example should prove
the justness of those observations upon the nature of solutions which are given in

borates. Such compounds of halogens with oxygen salts are known in nature (for

the fluoborates&mdash;for example, K<sub>4</sub>BF<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&mdash;may be expressed as that of a double salt,
BO(OK),3KF. If an excess of water decomposes them (Bazaroff), this does not prove
that they do not exist as such, for many double salts are decomposed by water.</p></div>

and hydrofluoric acid. It is evident that on the one side the competition between
water and hydrofluoric acid, and, on the other hand, their power to combine, are among
the forces which act here. From the fact that hydroborofluoric acid, HBF<sub>4</sub>, can only
exist in an aqueous solution, it must be assumed that it forms a somewhat stable system
only in the presence of 3H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

the vapours of HI and BCl<sub>3</sub> in a tube, or by the action of iodine vapour (at 750°) or HI
upon amorphous boron. BI<sub>3</sub> is a solid substance which dissolves in benzol and CS<sub>2</sub>, reacts
with water, melts at 43°, boils at 210°, has a density 3·3 at 50°, and partially decomposes

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_85" id="Footnote_17_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_85"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The process of <i>levigation</i> is based on the difference in the diameters of the particles
of clay and sand. In density these particles differ but little from each other, and therefore
a stream of water of a certain velocity can only carry away the particles of a certain
diameter, whilst the particles of a larger diameter cannot be borne away by it. This is
due to the resistance to falling offered by the water. This resistance to substances
moving in it increases with the velocity, and therefore a substance falling into water will
only move with an increasing velocity until its weight equals the resistance offered by
the water, and then the velocity will be uniform. And as the weight of the minute
particles of clay is small, the maximum velocity attained by them in falling is also small.
A detailed account of the theory of falling bodies in liquid, and of the experiments bearing
on this subject, may be found in my work, <i>Concerning the Resistance of Liquids and
Aeronautics</i>, 1880. The minute particles of clay remain suspended longer in water, and
take longer to fall to the bottom. Heavy particles, although of small dimensions, fall more
quickly, and are borne away by water with greater difficulty than the lighter. In this way
gold and other heavy ores are washed free from sand and clay, and the coarser portions and
heavier particles are left behind. A current of water of a certain velocity cannot carry
away with it particles of more than a definite diameter and density, but by increasing the
velocity of the current a point may be arrived at when it will bear away larger particles.
A description of apparatus for the observation of phenomena of this kind is given by
Schöne in his memoir in the Transactions of the Moscow Society of Natural Sciences for
1867. In order to be able accurately to vary the velocity of the current of water, a
cylinder is employed in which the earth to be experimented on is placed, and water is introduced
through the conical bottom of the cylinder. The rate at which the water rises
in the cylinder will vary according to the quantity of water flowing per unit of time into
the vessel, and consequently particles of various sizes will be carried away by the water
flowing over the upper edges of the vessel. Schöne showed by direct experiment that a
current of water having a velocity of 0·1 mm. per second will carry away particles having
a diameter of not more than 0·0075 mm., that is, only the most minute; with a velocity
<i>v</i> = 0·2 mm. per second, particles having a diameter <i>d</i> = 0·011 mm. are carried away;
with <i>v</i> = 0·3 mm., <i>d</i> = 0·0146 mm.; with <i>v</i> = 0·4 mm., <i>d</i> = 0·017 mm.; with <i>v</i> = 0·5 mm.,
<i>d</i> = 0·02 mm.; with <i>v</i> = 1 mm., <i>d</i> = 0·03 mm.; with <i>v</i> = 4 mm., <i>d</i> = 0·07 mm.; with
<i>v</i> = 10 mm., <i>d</i> = 0·137 mm.; with <i>v</i> = 12 mm., <i>d</i> = 0·15 mm.; and therefore if the current
does not exceed one of these velocities, it will only carry away or wash away particles
having a diameter less than that indicated. The sand and other particles mixed with
the clay will then remain in the vessel. The very minute particles obtained after levigation
are all considered as clay, although not only clay but other rock residue may also
exist in it as very fine particles. However, this is very seldom the case, and the fine
mud separated from all clays has practically the same composition as the purest kinds
of kaolin.</p>

<p>The relation between the amounts of clay and sand in soils used for the cultivation of
plants is very important, because a soil rich in clay is denser, heavier, shrinks up under
the action of heat, and does not readily yield to the plough in dry or wet weather, whilst
a soil rich in sand is friable, crumbling, easily parts with its moisture and dries rapidly,
but is comparatively easily worked. Neither crumbling sand nor pure clay can be regarded
as a good <i>cultivating soil</i>. The difference in the amounts of clay and sand in a
soil has also a purely chemical signification. Sand is easily permeated by the air, because
its particles are not closely packed together. Hence the chemical change of manures
proceeds very easily in sandy soils. But on the other hand such soils do not retain the
nutritious principles contained in the manure, nor the water necessary for the nourishment
of plants by means of their roots. Solutions of nutritious substances, containing
salts of potassium, phosphoric acid, &amp;c., when passed through sand only leave a portion
moistening the surface of its particles. The sand has only to be washed with pure water
and all the adhering films of solution are washed away. It is not so with clay. If the
above solutions be passed through a layer of clay the retention of the nutritive substances
of these solutions will be very marked; this is partly because of the very large surface
which the minute particles of clay expose. The nutritive elements dissolved in water are
retained by the particles of clay in a peculiar manner&mdash;that is, the absorptive power of
clay is very great compared to that of sand&mdash;and this has a great significance in the
economy of nature (Chapter XIII., p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_547">547</a>). It is evident that for cultivation the most
convenient soils in every respect will be those containing a definite mixture of clay and
sand, and indeed the most fertile soils have this composition. The study of fertile soils,
which is so important for a knowledge of the natural conditions for the application of
fertilisers, belongs, strictly speaking, to the province of agriculture. In Russia the first
foundation of a scientific fertilisation has been laid by Dokuchaeff. As an example only,
we will give the composition of four soils; (1) The black earth of the Simbirsk Government;
(2) a clay soil from the Smolensk Government; (3) a more sandy soil from the
Moscow Government; and (4) a peaty soil from near St. Petersburg. These analyses were
made in the laboratory of the St. Petersburg University about 1860, in connection with
experiments on fertilisation (conducted by me) by the Imperial Free Economical Society.
10,000 grams of air-dried soil contain the following quantities (in grams) of substances
capable of dissolving in acids, and of serving for the nourishment of plants.</p>

<p class="noindent">The black earth excels the other soils in many respects, but naturally its stores are also
exhausted by cultivation if nothing be returned to it in the form of fertilisers; and the
improvement of a soil (for instance, by the addition of marl or peat, and by drainage and
watering), and its fertilisation, if carried on in conformity with its composition and with
the properties of the plants to be cultivated, are capable of rendering not only every
soil fit for cultivation, but also of improving its value, so that in the course of time whole
countries (like Holland) may clearly improve their agricultural position, whilst under
the ordinary <i>régime</i> of continued exhaustion of the soil, entire regions (as, for instance,
many parts of Central Asia) may be rendered unfit for any agriculture.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_86" id="Footnote_18_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_86"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Everyone knows that a mixture of clay and water is endowed with the property of
taking a given form when subjected to a moderate pressure. This plasticity of clay
renders it an invaluable material for practical purposes. From clay are moulded and
manufactured a variety of objects, beginning with the common brick and ending with the
most delicate china works of art. This <i>plasticity of clay</i> increases with its purity.
When articles made of clay are dried, the well-known hard mass is obtained; but water
washes it away, and furthermore, the cohesion of its particles is not sufficiently great for
it to resist the impression of blows, shocks, &amp;c. If such an article be subjected to the
action of heat, its volume first decreases, then it begins to lose water, and it shrinks still
further (in the case of a compact mass approximately by &#8533; of its linear measurement).
On the other hand, a great coherence of particles is obtained, and thus burnt clay has the
hardness of stone. Pure clay, however, shrinks so considerably when burnt that the form
given to it is destroyed and cracks easily form; such vessels are also porous, so that
they will not hold water. The addition of sand&mdash;that is, silica in fine particles&mdash;or of
<i>chamotte</i>&mdash;that is, already burnt and crushed clay&mdash;renders the mass much more dense
and incapable of cracking in the furnace. Nevertheless, such clay articles (bricks,
earthenware vessels, &amp;c.) are still porous to liquids after being burnt, because the clay
in the furnace is only baked and does not fuse. In order to obtain articles impervious
to water the clay must either be mixed with substances which form a glassy mass in the
furnace, permeating the clay and filling up its pores, or else only the surface of the
article is covered with such a glassy fusible substance. In the first case the purest kinds
of clay give what is known as china, in the second case porcelain or &lsquo;faïence.&rsquo; So, for
instance, by covering the surface of clay articles with a layer of the oxides of lead and
tin, the well-known white glaze is obtained, because the oxides of these metals give a
white gloss when fused with silica and clay. In the preparation of china, fluor spar and
finely ground silica is mixed up into the clay; these ingredients give a mass which is
infusible but softens in the furnace, so that all the particles of the clay cohere in this
softened mass, which hardens on cooling. A glaze composed of glassy substances, which
only fuse at a high temperature, is also applied to the surface of china articles.</p></div>

and resembled natural rubies in their hardness, colour, size, and other properties. He
heated together a mixture of anhydrous alumina containing more or less caustic
potash, with barium fluoride and bichromate of potassium. The latter is added
to give the ruby its colour, and is taken in small quantity (not more than 4 parts by
weight to 100 parts of alumina). The mixture is put into a clay crucible, and heated
(for from 100 hours to 8 days) in a reverberatory furnace at a temperature approaching
1,500°. At the end of the experiment the crucible was found to contain a crystalline
mass, and the walls were covered with crystals of the ruby of a beautiful rose colour.
It was found that the access of moist air was indispensable for the reaction. According
to Frémy, the formation of the ruby may be here explained by the formation of fluoride
of aluminium which under the action of the moist air at the high temperature of the
furnace gives the ruby and hydrofluoric acid gas.</p></div>

from the fact that native anhydrous alumina, when converted into an exceedingly fine
powder by means of levigation, dissolves in a mixture of strong sulphuric acid and a small
quantity of water, especially when heated in a closed tube at 200°, or when fused with
acid sulphate of potassium (<i>see</i> Chapter XIII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_9_786">9</a>).</p></div>

alumina, moistened with a solution of cobalt salt, is ignited, it forms a blue mass called
Thénard's salt. This coloration is taken advantage of not only in the arts, but also for
distinguishing alumina from other earthy substances resembling it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_90" id="Footnote_21_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_90"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The treatment of bauxite is carried on on a large scale, chiefly in order to obtain
alumina from alkaline solutions, free from ferric oxide, because in dyeing it is necessary
to have salts of aluminium which do not contain iron. But this end, it would seem, may
also be obtained by igniting alumina containing ferric oxide in a stream of chlorine mixed
with hydrocarbon vapours, as ferric chloride then volatilises. K. Bayer observed that in
the treatment of bauxite with soda, about 4 molecules of sodium hydroxide pass into
solution to 1 molecule of alumina, and that on agitating this solution (especially in the
presence of some already precipitated aluminium hydroxide), about two-thirds of the
alumina is precipitated, so that only 1 molecule of alumina to 12 molecules of sodium
hydroxide remains in solution. This solution is evaporated directly, and used again.
He therefore treats bauxite directly with a solution of NaHO at 170° in a closed
boiler, and on cooling adds hydrated alumina to the resultant solution. The greater part
of the dissolved alumina then precipitates on this hydrated alumina, and the solution is
used over again. The hydroxide which separates from the alkaline solution contains
Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>. All these properties bear a great resemblance to those of boric acid. It may
be taken for granted that the relation between sodium hydroxide and alumina in solution
varies with the mass of water.</p>

<p>If lime be added to a solution of alumina in alkali (sodium aluminate) calcium
aluminate is precipitated, from which acids first extract the lime, leaving aluminium
hydroxide, which is easily soluble in acids (Loewig). When sodium aluminate is mixed
with a solution of sodium bicarbonate, a double carbonate of the alkali and aluminium
is precipitated, which is easily soluble in acids.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_91" id="Footnote_22_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_91"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> These coloured precipitates of alumina are termed <i>lakes</i>, and are employed in dyeing
tissues and in the formation of various pigments&mdash;such as pastels, oil colours, &amp;c.
Thus, if organic colouring matters, such as logwood, madder, &amp;c., are added to a solution
of any aluminium salt, and then an alkali is added, so that alumina may be precipitated,
these pigments, which are by themselves soluble in water, will come down with the precipitate.
This shows that alumina is able to combine with the colouring matter, and that
this compound is not decomposed by water. The dyes then become insoluble in water. If
a dye be mixed with starch paste and aluminium acetate, and then, by means of
engraved blocks having a design in relief, we transfer this mixture to a fabric which is
then heated, the aluminium acetate will leave the hydrogel of alumina which binds the
colouring matter, and water will no longer be able to wash the pigment from the material&mdash;that
is, a so-called &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; dye is obtained. In the case of dyeing a fabric a uniform
tint, it is first soaked in a solution of aluminium acetate and then dried, by which
means the acetic acid is driven off, while the hydrogel of alumina adheres to the fibres of
the material. If the latter be then passed through a solution of a dye in water, the
former will be attracted to the portions covered with alumina, and closely adhere to them.
If certain parts of the material be protected by the application of an acid, such as tartaric,
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, oxalic, citric, &amp;c. (these acids being non-volatile), the alumina will be dissolved
in those parts, and the pigment will not adhere, so that after washing, a white design
will be obtained on those parts which have been so protected.</p>

<p>In dye-works the aluminium acetate is generally obtained in solution by taking a
solution of alum, and mixing it with a solution of lead acetate. In this case lead
sulphate is precipitated and aluminium acetate remains in solution, together with either
acetate or sulphate of potassium, according to the amount of acetate of lead first taken.
The complete decomposition will be as follows: KAl(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2Pb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = KC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>

= 2Al(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 3PbSO<sub>4</sub>. If the resultant solution of aluminium acetate be
evaporated or further boiled, the acetic acid passes off and the hydrogel of alumina
remains.</p>

<p>As the salt of potassium obtained in the solution passes away with the water used
for washing, and the salt of lead precipitated has no practical use, this method for the
preparation of aluminium acetate cannot be considered economical; it is retained in the
process of dyeing mainly because both the salts employed, alum and sugar of lead, easily
crystallise, and it is easy to judge of their degree of purity in this form. Indeed, it is
very important to employ pure reagents in dyeing, because if impurity is present&mdash;such
as a small quantity of an iron compound&mdash;the tint of the dye changes; thus madders give
a red colour with alumina, but if oxide of iron be present the red changes into a violet
tint. The aluminium hydroxide is soluble in alkalis, whilst ferric oxide is not. Therefore
sodium aluminate&mdash;that is, the dissolved compound of alumina and caustic soda&mdash;obtained,
as already described, from bauxite, is sometimes employed in dyeing. Every
aluminium salt gives a solution containing sodium aluminate free from iron, when it is
mixed with excess of caustic soda. This solution, when mixed with a solution of
ammonium chloride, gives a precipitate of the hydrogel of alumina: Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3NaHO
+ 3NH<sub>4</sub>Cl = Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3NaCl + 3NH<sub>4</sub>OH. There was originally free soda, and on the
addition of sal-ammoniac there is free ammonia, and this does not dissolve alumina,
therefore the hydrogel of the latter is precipitated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_92" id="Footnote_23_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_92"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Another direct method for the preparation of pure aluminium compounds consists in
the treatment of <i>cryolite</i> containing aluminium fluoride together with sodium fluoride,
AlNa<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>. This mineral is exported from Greenland, and is also found in the Urals. It
is crushed and heated in reverberatory furnaces with lime, and the resultant mass is
treated with water; sodium aluminate is then obtained in solution, and calcium fluoride
in the precipitate AlNa<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub> + 3CaO = 3CaF<sub>2</sub> + AlNa<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_93" id="Footnote_24_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_93"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Crum first prepared a solution of basic acetate of alumina&mdash;that is, a salt containing
as large as possible an excess of aluminium hydroxide with as small as possible a quantity
of acetic acid. The solution must be dilute&mdash;that is, not contain more than one part of
alumina per 200 of water&mdash;and if this solution be heated in a closed vessel (so that the
acetic acid cannot evaporate) to the boiling point of water, for one and a half to two days,
then the solution, which apparently remains unaltered, loses its original astringent taste,
proper to solutions of all the salts of alumina, and has instead the purely acid taste of
vinegar. The solution then no longer contains the salt, but acetic acid and the hydrosol
of alumina in an uncombined state; they may be isolated from each other by evaporating
the acetic acid in shallow vessels at the ordinary temperature, and with a thin layer
of liquid the alumina does not separate as a precipitate. When the acid vapours cease to
come off there remains a solution of the hydrosol of alumina, which is tasteless and has
no action on litmus paper. When concentrated, this solution acquires a more and more
gluey consistency, and when completely evaporated over a water-bath it leaves a non-crystalline
glue-like hydrate, whose composition is Al<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub> = Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. The smallest
quantity of alkalis, and of many acids and salts, will convert the hydrosol into the
hydrogel of alumina&mdash;that is, convert the aluminium hydroxide from a soluble into an
insoluble form, or, as it is said, cause the hydrate to coagulate or gelatinise. The smallest
amount of sulphuric acid and its salts will cause the alumina to gelatinise&mdash;that is,
cause the hydrogel to separate. Many such colloidal solutions are known (Vol. I. p. 98,

<p>The most remarkable peculiarity of Graham's solution is that it solidifies on litmus
paper, and leaves a blue ring on it, which shows the alkaline&mdash;that is, basic&mdash;character
of the alumina in such a solution. If in the dialysis the basic hydrochloric acid salt
be replaced by a similar acetic acid salt, a hydrosol of alumina is obtained which does
not act upon litmus.</p></div>

volatile acid, parts with its acid on heating an aqueous solution&mdash;that is, is decomposed
by water, and forms either basic salts or a hydrate of alumina. By dissolving
aluminium hydroxide in nitric acid we may easily obtain a well-crystallising <i>aluminium
nitrate</i>, Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O, which fuses at 73° without decomposing (Ordway), gives a
basic salt, 2Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,6HNO<sub>3</sub>, at 100°, and at 140° leaves the aluminium hydroxide perfectly
free from the elements of nitric acid. But the solutions of this salt, like those of the
acetate, are also able to yield aluminium hydroxide. From all this it is evident that
we must suppose that the solutions of this and similar salts contain an equilibrated
dissociated system, containing the salt, the acid, and the base, and their compounds with
water, as well as partly the molecules of water itself. Such examples much more
clearly confirm those conceptions of solutions which are given in the first chapter than a
general preliminary acquaintance with the subject can do.</p></div>

at Tolfa, near Rome. Its composition is K<sub>2</sub>O,3Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,4SO<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O (alunite contains 9H<sub>2</sub>O).
It is soluble in water but not decomposed by it, but after being slightly ignited it gives

(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, SiO<sub>2</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.) which show (like water also) the properties of feeble bases
and feeble acids, there is probably some causal reason for this coincidence, all the more

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_100" id="Footnote_30_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_100"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Since Deville's experiments the question of the density of aluminium chloride has
been frequently re-investigated. The subject has more especially occupied the attention
of Nilson, Pettersson, Friedel and Crafts, and V. Meyer and his collaborators. In general,
it has been found that at low temperatures (up to 440°) the density is constant, and
indicates a molecule Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>; whilst depolymerisation probably (although it is not yet
certain) takes place at higher temperatures, and the molecule AlCl<sub>3</sub> is obtained. Along
with this there has been, and still is, a difference of opinion as to the vapour density of
aluminium ethyl and methyl&mdash;whether for instance, Al(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> or Al<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> expresses the
molecule of the latter. The interest of these researches is intimately connected with the
question of the valency of aluminium, if we hold to the opinion that elements in their
various compounds have a constant and strictly definite valency. In this case the
formula AlCl<sub>3</sub> or Al(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> would show that Al is trivalent, and that consequently the
compounds of aluminium are Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, AlO<sub>3</sub>Al, and, in general, AlX<sub>3</sub>. But if the molecule
be Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, it is&mdash;for the followers of the doctrine of the invariable valency of the
elements&mdash;incompatible with the idea of the trivalency of aluminium, and they assume
it to be quadrivalent like carbon, likening Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> to ethane C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> = CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, although
this does not explain why Al does not form AlCl<sub>4</sub>, or, in general, AlX<sub>4</sub>. In this work
another supposition is introduced; according to this, although aluminium, as an element
of group III., gives compounds of the type AlX<sub>5</sub>, this does not exclude the possibility of
these molecules combining with others, and consequently with <i>each other</i>&mdash;that is,
forming Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>; just as the molecules of univalent elements exist either as H<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.,
or as Na, and the molecules of bivalent elements either as Zn, or as S<sub>2</sub>, or even S<sub>6</sub>. In
the first place it must be recognised that the limiting form does not exhaust all power of
combination, it only exhausts the capacity of the element for combining with X's, but
the saturated substance may afterwards combine with <i>whole molecules</i>, which fact is
best proved by the capacity of substances to form crystalline compounds with water,
ammonia, &amp;c. But in some substances this faculty for further combinations is less
developed (for instance, in carbon tetrachloride, CCl<sub>4</sub>), whilst in others it is more so.
AlX<sub>3</sub> combines with many other molecules. Now if a limiting form, which does not
combine with new X's, nevertheless combines with other whole molecules, it will
naturally in some instances combine with itself, will polymerise. In this manner the
mind clearly grasps the idea that the same forces which cause S<sub>2</sub> to unite itself to Cl<sub>2</sub>,
or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> to Cl<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., also unite molecules of a similar kind together; thus <i>polymerisation</i>
ceases to be an isolated fragmentary phenomenon, and chemical combinations &lsquo;by
analogy&rsquo; acquire a particular and important interest. In conformity with these views
the following proposition may be made concerning the compounds of aluminium. They
are of the type AlX<sub>3</sub> in the limit, like BX<sub>3</sub>, but those limiting forms are still able to
combine to form AlX<sub>3</sub>,RZ, and the aluminium chloride is a compound of this kind&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
(AlX<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. In boron, for example, in BCl<sub>3</sub>, this tendency to form further compounds is
less developed. Hence boron chloride appears as BCl<sub>3</sub>, and not (BCl<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Polymerisation
is not only possible when a substance has not attained the limit (although it is more
probable then), but also when the limiting form has been reached, if only the latter has
the faculty of combining with other whole molecules. We may therefore conclude that
aluminium, like boron, is trivalent in the same sense that lithium and sodium are
univalent, magnesium bivalent, and carbon tetravalent. In a word, there is no reason
to consider that aluminium is capable of forming compounds AlX<sub>4</sub>, and in that way to
explain the existence of the molecule Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>. Furthermore, there are many reasons for
thinking that AlF<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and other empirical formulæ do not express the molecular
weights of these compounds, but that they are much higher: Al<sub><i>n</i></sub>F<sub>3<i>n</i></sub>, Al<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>O<sub>3<i>n</i></sub>. In
recent years convincing proofs of the truth of the above statements have been obtained,
and of the independent existence of AlX<sub>3</sub> in a state of vapour; for Comb has determined
the vapour density of the volatile acetyl of aluminium acetate Al(C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>7</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>
(which melts at 193°, boils at 315°, and distils without a trace of decomposition), and has
found that it exactly corresponds to the above molecular composition. On the other hand,
Louise and Roux (1889) by employing the method of &lsquo;freezing point depression&rsquo; of
solutions (Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_49_96">49</a>) found that the molecules Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>6</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>6</sub>,
&amp;c., correspond to the type Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>. Thus it may now be accepted that the molecular
composition of the compounds of aluminium in their simplest form is AlX<sub>3</sub>, but that
they may polymerise and give Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> or, in general, Al<sub>2</sub>X<sub>3<i>n</i></sub>.</p></div>

pressure of 250 mm., and at 213° under 2,278 mm.), according to Friedel and Crafts, so
that it boils immediately after fusion. According to Seubert and Pallard (1892), Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>
fuses at 193°. Aluminium bromide fuses at about 92°, and the iodide at 185° according to
Weber, at 125° according to Deville and Troost.</p>

<p>All these halogen compounds of aluminium are soluble in water. <i>Aluminium
fluoride</i>, AlF<sub>3</sub> (Al<sub><i>n</i></sub>F<sub>3<i>n</i></sub>), is insoluble in water. It is obtained by dissolving alumina in
hydrofluoric acid; a solution is then formed, but it contains an excess of hydrofluoric
acid. When this solution is evaporated, crystals containing Al<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>,HF,H<sub>2</sub>O are obtained.
They are also insoluble in water. By saturating the above solution with a large quantity
of alumina, and then evaporating, we obtain crystals having the composition Al<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O.
All these compounds, when ignited, leave insoluble anhydrous aluminium fluoride. It
forms colourless rhombohedra, which are non-volatile, of sp. gr. 3·1, and are decomposed
by steam into alumina and hydrofluoric acid. The acid solution apparently contains a
compound which has its corresponding salts; by the addition of a solution of potassium
fluoride, a gelatinous precipitate of AlK<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub> is obtained. A similar compound occurs in
nature&mdash;namely, AlNa<sub>3</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, or <i>cryolite</i>, sp. gr. 3·0.</p></div>

and probably in the aqueous solution the elements of the hydrochloric acid are already
separated, at least partially, from the aluminium hydroxide. The solution may also be
obtained by the action of aluminium hydroxide on hydrochloric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_107" id="Footnote_35_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_107"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Here we see an instance in confirmation of what has been said in Note <a href="#Footnote_30_100">30</a>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the
action of the molecule AlCl<sub>3</sub>. We will cite still another instance confirming the power
of alumina to enter into complex combinations. Alumina, moistened with a solution of
calcium chloride, gives, when ignited, an anhydrous crystalline substance (tetrahedral),
which is soluble in acids, and contains (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(CaO)<sub>10</sub>CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Even clay forms a similar
stony substance, which might be of practical use.</p>

<p>Among the most complex compounds of aluminium, <i>ultramarine</i>, or <i>lapis lazuli</i>,
must be mentioned. It occurs in nature near Lake Baikal, in crystals, some colourless
and others of various tints&mdash;green, blue, and violet. When heated it becomes dull and
acquires a very brilliant blue colour. In this form it is used for ornaments (like malachite),
and as a brilliant blue pigment. At the present time ultramarine is prepared
artificially in large quantities, and this process is one of the most important conquests
of science; for the blue tint of ultramarine has been the object of many scientific
researches, which have culminated in the manufacture of this native substance. The
most characteristic property of ultramarine is that when placed in sulphuric acid it
evolves hydrogen sulphide and becomes colourless. This shows that the blue colour of
ultramarine is due to the presence of sulphides. If clay be heated in a furnace with
sodium sulphate and charcoal (forming sodium sulphide) without access of air, a white
mass is obtained, which becomes green when heated in the air, and when treated with
water leaves a colourless substance known as &lsquo;white ultramarine.&rsquo; When ignited in the
air it absorbs oxygen and turns blue. The coloration is ascribed to the presence of
metallic sulphides or polysulphides, but it is most probable that silicon sulphide, or its
oxysulphide, SiOS, is present. At all events the sulphides play an important part, but
the problem is not yet quite settled. The formula Na<sub>8</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>24</sub>S is ascribed to white
ultramarine. The green probably contains more sulphur, and the blue a still larger
quantity. The last is supposed to contain Na<sub>8</sub>Al<sub>6</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub>24</sub>S<sub>3</sub>. It is more probable
(according to Guckelberger, 1882) that the composition of the blue varies between
Si<sub>18</sub>Al<sub>18</sub>Na<sub>20</sub>S<sub>6</sub>O<sub>71</sub> and Si<sub>18</sub>Al<sub>12</sub>Na<sub>20</sub>S<sub>6</sub>O<sub>69</sub>. The latter may be expressed as
(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>18</sub>(Na<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>10</sub>S<sub>6</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which would indicate the presence of insufficiently-oxidised
sulphur in ultramarine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_108" id="Footnote_36_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_108"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> At the ordinary temperature aluminium does not decompose water, but if a small
quantity of iodine, or of hydriodic acid and iodine, or of aluminium iodide and iodine, is
added to the water, then hydrogen is abundantly evolved. It is evident that here the
reaction proceeds at the expense of the formation of Al<sub>2</sub>I<sub>6</sub>, and that this substance, with
water, gives aluminium hydroxide and hydriodic acid, which, with aluminium, evolves
hydrogen. Aluminium probably belongs to those metals having a greater affinity for
oxygen than for the halogens (Note <a href="#Footnote_36_TRI_110">36 tri</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_BIS_109" id="Footnote_36_BIS_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_BIS_109"><span class="label">[36 bis]</span></a> As an example we may mention that if mercury comes in contact with metallic
aluminium and especially if it be rubbed upon the surface of aluminium moistened with
a dilute acid, the Al becomes rapidly oxidised (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> being formed). The oxidation is
accompanied by a very curious appearance, as it were of wool (or fur) formed by threads
of oxide of aluminium growing upon the metal. This was first pointed out by Cass in
1870, and subsequently by A. Sokoleff in 1892. This interesting and curious phenomenon
has not to my knowledge been further studied.</p>

<p>I think it necessary, however, to add that according to Lubbert and Rascher's
researches (1891), wine, coffee, milk, oil, urine, earth, &amp;c., have no more action upon aluminium
vessels than upon copper, tin, and other similar articles. In the course of four
months ordinary vinegar dissolved 0·35 grm. of Al per sq. centimetre, whilst a 5 per cent.
solution of common salt dissolved about 0·05 grm. of aluminium. Ditte (1890)
showed that Al is acted upon by nitric and sulphuric acids, although only slowly (owing to
the formation of a layer of gas, as in Chapter <a href="#Page_39">XVI.</a>, Note <a href="#Footnote_10_42">10</a>) and that the reaction proceeds
much more rapidly in vacuo or in the presence of oxidising agents. Al is even
oxidised by water on the surface, but the thin coating of alumina formed prevents
further action. In the course of twelve hours nitric acid sp. gr. 1·383 dissolved at 17°
about 20 grms. of aluminium (containing only a small amount of Si, 1&frac14; p.c.) from a sq.
metre of surface (Le Rouart, 1891).</p></div>

a mixture of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and charcoal in sulphur vapour proceeds with difficulty, Gray (1894)
proposed to prepare Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> by heating a mixture of charcoal, sulphate of aluminium, and

carbon and forms an alloy which, according to Moissan, when rapidly treated with <i>cold</i>
hydrochloric acid leaves a compound C<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>4</sub> in the form of a yellow crystalline transparent
powder, sp. gr. 2·36 (<i>see</i> Chapter VIII. Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_12_BIS_454">12 bis</a>). This <i>carbide of aluminium</i>
C<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>4</sub> corresponds to methane CH<sub>4</sub>, for Al replaces H<sub>3</sub> and carbon O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>4</sub>, that is, it is
equal to three molecules of CH<sub>4</sub> with the substitution of twelve atoms of H in
it by four of Al, or, what is the same thing, it is the duplicated molecule of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with
the substitution of O<sub>6</sub> by C<sub>3</sub>. And indeed C<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>4</sub> under the action of water forms marsh
gas and hydrate of alumina: C<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>4</sub> + 12H<sub>2</sub>O = 3CH<sub>4</sub> + 4Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>. This decomposition
gives a new aspect of the synthesis of hydrocarbons, and quite agrees with what should
follow from the action of water upon the metallic carbides as applied by me for explaining
the origin of naphtha (Chapter VIII., Notes <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_57_504">57</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_58_505">58</a>, and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_59_506">59</a>).

= 417 millionths of a millimetre. The metal can be separated from the solution, containing
a mixture of the many metals occurring in the zinc blende, by making use of the
following reactions: it is precipitated by sodium carbonate in the first portions; it gives
a sulphate which, on boiling, easily decomposes into a basic salt, very slightly soluble
in water; and it is deposited in a metallic state from its solutions by the action of a
galvanic current. It fuses at +30°, and, when once fused, remains liquid for some
time. It oxidises with difficulty, evolves hydrogen from hydrochloric acid and from
potassium hydroxide, and, like all feeble bases (for instance, alumina and indium oxide),
it easily forms basic salts. The hydroxide is soluble in a solution of caustic potash,
and slightly so in caustic ammonia. Gallium forms volatile GaCl<sub>3</sub> and GaCl<sub>2</sub> (Nilson and
Pettersson).</p></div>

Pettersson, confirms this atomic weight. Indium is separated from zinc and cadmium,
with which it occurs, by taking advantage of the fact that its hydroxide is insoluble in
ammonia, that the solutions of its salts give indium when treated with zinc (hence indium
is dissolved after zinc by acids) and that they give a precipitate with hydrogen sulphide
even in acid solutions. Metallic indium is grey, has a sp. gr. of 7·42, fuses at 176°, and
does not oxidise in the air; when ignited, it first gives a black suboxide, In<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, then
volatilises and gives a brown oxide, In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, whose salts, InX<sub>3</sub>, are also formed by the
direct action of acids on the metal, hydrogen being evolved. Caustic alkalis do not act
on indium, from which it is evident that it is less capable of forming alkaline compounds
than aluminium is; however, with potassium and sodium hydroxides, solutions of indium
salts give a colourless precipitate of the hydroxide, which is soluble in an excess of the
alkali, like the hydroxides of aluminium and zinc. Its salts do not crystallise. Nilson
and Pettersson (1889), by the action of HCl upon In, obtained volatile crystalline,
InCl<sub>2</sub>, and by treating this compound with In, InCl also.</p></div>

containing lead, silver, thallium, and selenium. Its isolation depends on the fact that in
the presence of acids thallium forms thallous compounds, TlX. Among these compounds
the chloride and sulphate are only slightly soluble, and give with hydrogen sulphide a
black precipitate of the sulphide Tl<sub>2</sub>S, which is soluble in an excess of acid, but insoluble
in ammonium sulphide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_BIS_118" id="Footnote_41_BIS_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_BIS_118"><span class="label">[41 bis]</span></a> The best method of preparing thallous hydroxide, TlOH, is by the decomposition
of the requisite quantity of baryta by thallous sulphate, which is slightly soluble in water;
barium sulphate is then obtained in the precipitate and thallous hydroxide in solution.
This solubility of the hydroxide is exceedingly characteristic, and forms one of the most
important properties of thallium. These lower (thallous) compounds are of the type
TlX, and recall the salts of the alkalis. The salts TlX are colourless, do not give a precipitate
with the alkalis or ammonia, but are precipitated by ammonium carbonate,
because thallous carbonate, Tl<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is sparingly soluble in water. Platinic chloride gives
the same kind of precipitate as it does with the salts of potassium&mdash;that is, thallous
platinochloride, PtTl<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>. All these facts, together with the isomorphism of the salts
TlX with those of potassium, again point out what an important significance the types
of compounds have in the determination of the character of a given series of substances.
Although thallium has a greater atomic weight and greater density than potassium, and
although it has a less atomic volume, nevertheless thallous oxide is analogous to
potassium oxide in many respects, for they both give compounds of the same type,
RX. We may further remark that thallous fluoride, TlF, is easily soluble in water as
well as thallous silicofluoride, SiTl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, but that thallous cyanide, TlCN, is sparingly
soluble in water. This, together with the slight solubility of thallous chloride, TlCl, and
sulphate, Tl<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, indicates an analogy between TlX and the salts of silver, AgX.</p>

<p>As regards the higher oxide or the <i>thallic oxide</i>, Tl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the thallium is trivalent in it&mdash;that
is, it forms compounds of the type TlX<sub>3</sub>. The hydroxide, TlO(OH), is formed by the
action of hydrogen peroxide on thallous oxide, or by the action of ammonia on a solution
of thallic chloride, TlCl<sub>3</sub>. It is obtained as a brown precipitate, insoluble in water
but easily soluble in acids, with which it gives thallic salts, TlX<sub>3</sub>. Thallic chloride, which
is obtained by cautiously heating the metal in a stream of chlorine, forms an easily
fusible white mass, which is soluble in water and able to part with two-thirds of its
chlorine when heated. An aqueous solution of this salt yields colourless crystals containing
one equivalent of water. It is evident from the above that all the thallic salts
can easily be reduced to thallous salts by reducing agents such as sulphurous anhydride,
zinc, &amp;c. Besides these salts, thallic sulphate, Tl<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, thallic nitrate
Tl(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c., are known. These salts are decomposed by water, like the salts of
many feeble basic metals&mdash;for example, aluminium.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_119" id="Footnote_42_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_119"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The specific heat of cerium determined (1870) by me, and afterwards confirmed by
Hillebrand, corresponds with that atomic weight of cerium according to which the composition
of two oxides should be Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CeO<sub>2</sub>. Hillebrand also obtained metallic
lanthanum and didymium by decomposing their salts by a galvanic current, and he
found their specific heats to be near that of cerium and about 0·04, and it is therefore
justifiable to give them an atomic weight near that of cerium, as was done on the basis
of the periodic law. Up to 1870 yttrium oxide was also given the formula RO. Having
re-determined the equivalent of yttrium oxide (with respect to water), and found it to be
74·6, I considered it necessary to also ascribe to it the composition Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, because then
it falls into its proper place in the periodic system. If the equivalent of the oxide to
water be 74·6, it contains 58·6 of metal per 16 of oxygen, and consequently one part by
weight of hydrogen replaces 29·3 of yttrium, and if it be regarded as bivalent (oxide
RO), it would not, by its atomic weight 58·6, find a place in the second group. But
if it be taken as trivalent&mdash;that is, if the formula of its oxide be R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and salts RX<sub>3</sub>&mdash;then
Y = 88, and a position is open for it in the third group in the sixth series after rubidium
and strontium. These alterations in the atomic weights of the cerite and gadolinite
metals were afterwards accepted by Clève and other investigators, who now ascribe
a formula R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to all the newly discovered oxides of these metals. But still the position
in the periodic system of certain elements&mdash;for example of holmium, thulium, samarium,
and others&mdash;has not yet been determined for want of a sufficient knowledge of their properties
in a state of purity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_120" id="Footnote_43_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_120"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> So, for example, in 1871, in the <i>Journal of the Russian Physico-Chemical Society</i>
(p. 45) and in Liebig's <i>Annalen</i>, Supt. Band viii. 198, I deduced, on the basis of the
periodic law, an atomic weight 44 for ekaboron, and Nilson in 1888 found that of scandium,
which is ekaboron, to be Sc = 44·03, The periodic law showed that the specific gravity of
the ekaboron oxide would be about 8·5, that it would have decided but feeble basic properties
and that it would give colourless salts. And this proved to be the case with
scandium oxide. In describing scandium, Clève and Nilson acknowledge that the particular
interest attached to this element is due to its complete identity with the expected
element ekaboron. And this accurate foretelling of properties could only be arrived at by
admitting that alteration of the atomic weights of the cerite and gadolinite metals which
was one of the first results of the application of the periodic system of the elements to
the interpretation of chemical facts. In my first memoirs, namely, in the <i>Bulletin of
the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences</i>, vol. viii. (1870), and in Liebig's <i>Annalen</i> (<i>l. c.</i>
p. 168) and others, I particularly insisted on the necessity of altering the then accepted
atomic weights of cerium, lanthanum, and didymium. Clève, Höglund, Hillebrand and
Norton, and more especially Brauner, and others accepted the proposed alteration, and
gave fresh proofs in favour of the proposed alterations of these atomic weights. The study
of the fluorides was particularly important. Placing cerium in the fourth group, the
composition of its highest oxide would then be CeO<sub>2</sub>, and its compounds CeX<sub>4</sub> and the
lower oxide, Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or CeX<sub>3</sub>. Brauner obtained the fluoride CeF<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O corresponding
with the first, and a double crystalline salt, 3KF,2CeF<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, without any admixture of
compound of the lower grade CeX<sub>3</sub>, which generally occur together with the majority of
salts corresponding with CeX<sub>4</sub>. It will be seen from these formulæ and from the tables of
the elements, that cerium and didymium do not belong to the third group, which is now
being described, but we mention them here for convenience, as all the cerite and
gadolinite metals have much in common. These metals, which are rare in nature,
resemble each other in many respects, always accompany each other, are with difficulty
isolated from each other, and stand together in the periodic system of the elements;
they have acquired a peculiar interest owing to their having been in 1870 the objects of
the study of Marignac, Delafontaine, Soret, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, Brauner, Clève,
Nilson, the professors of Upsala, and others.</p>

<p>The cerite and gadolinite metals occur in rare siliceous minerals from Sweden,
America, the Urals, and Baikal, such as cerite (in Sweden), gadolinite, and orthite; and
in still rarer minerals formed by titanic, niobic, and tantalic acids, such as euxenite in
Norway and America, and samarskite in Norway, the Urals and America, and in a few
rare fluorides and phosphates. Among the latter, monazite is found in somewhat
considerable quantities in Brazil and North Carolina; this contains the phosphate of
cerium, CePO<sub>4</sub> (= Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), together with didymium, thorium and lanthanum (according
to W. Edron and Shapleigh's analyses), and is now used for preparing that mixture of
the oxides of the rare metals (especially ThO<sub>2</sub>, Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, La<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.), which is employed for
incandescent burners (Auer von Welsbach), as it has been found by experiment that
these oxides when raised to incandescence in a non-luminous gas flame, give a far
more brilliant flame with a smaller consumption of gas, besides being suitable for such
non-luminous gases as water gas. The insufficiency of material to work upon, and
the difficulty of separating the oxides from each other, are the chief reasons why
the composition of the compounds of these rare metals is so imperfectly known.
Cerite is the most accessible of these minerals. Besides silica it contains more
than 50 p.c. of the oxides of cerium, lanthanum (from 4 p.c.), and didymium. The
decomposition of its powder by sulphuric acid gives sulphates, all of which are soluble in
water. The other minerals mentioned above are also decomposed in the same manner.
The solution of sulphates is precipitated with free oxalic acid, which forms salts insoluble
in water and dilute acids with all the cerite and gadolinite oxides. The oxides themselves
are obtained by igniting the oxalates. When ignited in the air the cerium
passes from its ordinary oxide Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> into the higher oxide CeO<sub>2</sub>, which is so feeble a
base that its salts are decomposed by water, and it is insoluble in dilute nitric acid.
Therefore it is always possible to remove all the cerium oxide by repeated ignitions and
solutions in sulphuric acid. The further separation of the metals is mainly based on
four methods employed by many investigators.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A solution of the mixed salts is treated with an excess of solid potassium sulphate.
Double salts, such as Ce<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,3K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, are thus formed. The gadolinite metals,
namely yttrium, ytterbium, and erbium, then remain in solution&mdash;that is, their double
salts are soluble in a solution of potassium sulphate, whilst the cerite metals&mdash;namely,
cerium, lanthanum, and didymium&mdash;are precipitated, that is, their double salts are
insoluble in a saturated solution of potassium sulphate. This ordinary method of
separation, however, appears from the researches of Marignac to be so untrustworthy
that a considerable amount of didymium and the other metals remain in the soluble portion,
owing to the fact that, although individually insoluble, they are dissolved when
mixed together. Thus erbium and terbium occur both in the solution and precipitate.
Nevertheless, beryllium, yttrium, erbium, and ytterbium belong to the soluble, and scandium,
cerium, lanthanum, didymium, and thorium to the insoluble portion. The insoluble
salt of scandium, for example (<i>i.e.</i> insoluble in a solution of potassium sulphate), has a
composition Sc<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,3K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The oxides obtained by the ignition of the oxalates are dissolved in nitric acid (the
nitrates of the cerite metals easily form double salts with those of the alkali metals, and
as some&mdash;for example, the ammonio-lanthanum salt&mdash;crystallise very well, they should be
studied and applied to the analytical separation of these metals), the solution is then
evaporated to dryness, and the residue fused. All nitrates are destroyed by heat; those
of aluminium and iron, &amp;c., very easily, those of the cerite and gadolinite metals also
easily (although not so easily as the above) but in different degrees and sequence; so that
by carrying on the decomposition carefully from the beginning it is possible to destroy
the nitrate of only one metal without touching the others, or leaving them as insoluble
basic salts. This method, like the preceding and the two following, must be repeated
as many as seventy times to attain a really constant product of fixed properties, that
is, one in which the decomposed and undecomposed portions contain one and the same
oxide. This method, due to Berlin and worked out by Bunsen, has given in the hands of
Marignac and Nilson the best results, especially for the separation of the gadolinite
metals, ytterbium and scandium.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A solution of the salts is partially precipitated by ammonia; that is, the solution is
mixed with a small quantity of ammonia insufficient for the precipitation of the entire
quantity of the bases (fractional precipitation). Thus, the didymium hydroxide is first
precipitated from a mixture of the salts of didymium and lanthanum. A partial separation
may be effected by repeating the solution of the precipitate and fractional
precipitation, but a perfectly pure product is scarcely attainable.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The formates having different degrees of solubility (lanthanum formate 420 parts
of water per one of salt, didymium formate 221, cerium formate 360, yttrium and erbium
formates easily soluble) give a possible means of separating certain of the gadolinite
metals from each other by a method of fractional solution and precipitation, as Bunsen,
Bahr, Clève, and others have pointed out.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Crookes (1893) took advantage of the fractional precipitation of alcoholic solutions
of the chlorides by amylene, and by this means separated, for example, erbium, terbium,
and others.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Lastly, oxide of thorium ThO<sub>2</sub> (Chapter VIII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_59_506">59</a>) is separated by means of
its solubility in a solution of sodium carbonate.</p>

<p>A good method of separating these metals is not known, for they are so like each
other. There are also only a few <i>methods of distinguishing</i> them from each other, and
we can only add the following four to the above.</p>

<p><sup>a</sup> The faculty of oxidising into a higher oxide. This is very characteristic for cerium,
which gives the oxides Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and CeO<sub>2</sub> or Ce<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Didymium also gives one colourless
oxide, Di<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which is capable of forming salts (of a lilac colour), and another, according
to Brauner, Di<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> which is dark brown and does not form salts, so far as is known,
and (like ceric oxide) acts as an oxidising agent, like the higher oxides of tellurium,
manganese, lead, and others. Lanthanum, yttrium, and many others are not capable
of such oxidation. The presence of the higher oxides may be recognised by ignition in
a stream of hydrogen, by which means the higher oxides are reduced to the lower, which
then remain unaltered.</p>

<p><sup>b</sup> The majority of the salts of the gadolinite and cerite metals are colourless, but
those of didymium and erbium are rose-coloured, the salts of the higher oxide of cerium,
CeX<sub>4</sub>, yellow, of the higher oxide of terbium, yellow, &amp;c. Thus, the first metals obtained
from gadolinite were yttrium, giving colourless, and erbium, giving rose-coloured,
salts. Afterwards it was found that the salts of erbium of former investigators contained
numerous colourless salts of scandium, ytterbium, &amp;c., so that a coloration sometimes
indicates the presence of a small impurity, as was long known to be the case in
minerals, and therefore this point of distinction cannot be considered trustworthy.</p>

<p><sup>c</sup> In a solid state and in solutions, the salts of didymium, samarium, holmium, &amp;c.,
give characteristic absorption spectra, as we pointed out in Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_543">XIII.</a>, and this
naturally is connected with the colour of these salts. The most important point is, that
those metals which do not give an absorption spectrum&mdash;for example, lanthanum,
yttrium, scandium, and ytterbium&mdash;may be obtained free from didymium, samarium,
and the other metals giving absorption spectra, because the presence of the latter may
be easily recognised by means of the spectroscope, whilst the presence of the former in
the latter cannot be distinguished, and therefore the purification of the former can be
carried further than that of the latter. We may further remark that the sensitiveness
of the spectrum reaction for didymium is so great that it is possible with a layer of
solution half a metre thick to recognise the presence of 1 part of didymium oxide (as
salt) in 40,000 parts of water. Cossa determined the presence of didymium (together
with cerium and lanthanum) in apatites, limestones, bones, and the ashes of plants by
this method. The main group of dark lines of didymium correspond with wave-lengths
of from 580 to 570 millionths mm.; and the secondary to about 520, 730, 480, &amp;c. The
chief absorption bands of samarium are 472&ndash;486, 417, 500, and 559. Besides which,
Crookes applied the investigation of the spectra of the phosphorescent light which is
emitted by certain earths in an almost perfect vacuum, when an electric discharge is passed
through it, to the discovery and characterisation of these rare metals. But it would seem
that the smallest admixture of other oxides (for example, bismuth, uranium) so powerfully
influences these spectra that the fundamental distinctions of the oxides cannot be determined
by this method. Besides which, the spectra obtained by the passage of sparks
through solutions or powders of the salts are determined and applied to distinguishing
the elements, but as spectra vary with the temperature and elasticity (concentration)
this method cannot be considered as trustworthy.</p>

<p><sup>d</sup> The most important point of distinction of individual metallic oxides is given by
the direct <i>determination of their equivalent with respect to water</i>&mdash;that is, the amount
of the oxide by weight which combines (like water) with 80 parts by weight of sulphuric
anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, for the formation of a normal salt. For this purpose the oxide is weighed
and dissolved in nitric acid, sulphuric acid is then added, and the whole is evaporated to
dryness over a water-bath and then heated over a naked flame sufficiently strongly to
drive off the excess of sulphuric acid, but so as not to decompose the salt (the product would
in that case not be perfectly soluble in water); then, knowing the weight of the oxide
and of the anhydrous sulphate, we can find the equivalent of the oxide. The following are
the most trustworthy figures in this connection: scandium oxide 45·35 (Nilson), yttrium
oxide 75·7 (Clève; according to my determination, 1871&mdash;74·6), cerous oxide&mdash;that is, the
lower form of oxidation of cerium, according to various investigators (Bunsen, Brauner,
and others) from 108 to 111, the higher oxide of cerium from 85 to 87, lanthanum oxide,
according to Brauner, 108, didymium oxide (in salts of the ordinary lower form of
oxidation) about 112 (Marignac, Brauner, Clève), samarium oxide about 116 (Clève),
ytterbium oxide 131·3 (Nilson). It may not be superfluous here to draw attention to the
fact that the equivalent of the oxides of all the gadolinite and cerite metals for water
distribute themselves into four groups with a somewhat constant difference of nearly 30.
In the first group is scandium oxide with equivalent 45, in the second, yttrium oxide 76,
in the third, lanthanum, cerium, didymium, and samarium oxides with equivalent about
110, and, in the fourth, erbium, ytterbium, and thorium oxides with equivalent about 131.
The common difference of period is nearly 45. And if we ascribe the type R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to all
the oxides&mdash;that is, if we triple the weight of the equivalent of the oxide&mdash;we shall
obtain a difference of the groups nearly equal to 90, which, for two atoms of the metal,
forms the ordinary periodic difference of 45. If one and the same type of oxide R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> be
ascribed to all these elements (as now generally accepted, in many cases there being
insufficiently trustworthy data), then the atomic weights should be Sc = 44, Y = 89,
La = 138, Ce = 140, Di = 144, (neodymium 140, praseodymium 144), Sm = 150, Yb = 173,
also terbium 147, holmium 162, alphayttrium 157, erbium 166, thulium 170, decipium 171.
It should be observed that there may be instances of basic salts. If, for example, an
element with an atomic weight 90 gave an oxide RO<sub>2</sub>, but salts ROX<sub>2</sub>, then by counting
its oxide as R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> its atomic weight would be 159.</p>

<p>All the points distinguishing many gadolinite and cerite elements have not been
sufficiently well established in certain cases (for example, with decipium, thulium, holmium,
and others). At present the most certain are yttrium, scandium, cerium, and
lanthanum. In the case of didymium, for example, there is still much that is doubtful.
Didymium, discovered in 1842 by Mosander after lanthanum, differs from the latter in
its absorption spectrum and the lilac-rose colour of its salts. Delafontaine (1878) separated
samarium from it. Welsbach showed that it contains two particular elements,
neodymium (salts bluish-red) and praseodymium (salts apple-green), and Becquerel
(1887) by investigating the spectra of crystals, recognised the presence of six individual
elements. Probably, therefore, many of the now recognised elements contain a
mixture of various others, and as yet there is not enough confirmation of their individuality.
As regards yttrium, scandium, cerium, and lanthanum, which have been
established without doubt, I think that, owing to their great rarity in nature and
chemical art, it would be superfluous to describe them further in so elementary a
work as the present. We may add that Winkler (1891) obtained a hydrogen compound
of lanthanum, whose composition (according to Brauner) is La<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>, as would be expected
from the composition of Na<sub>2</sub>H, Mg<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. C. Winkler (1891), on reducing CeO<sub>2</sub> with
magnesium, also remarked a rapid absorption of hydrogen, and showed that a <i>hydride of
cerium</i>, CeH<sub>2</sub>, corresponding to CaH, and the other similar hydrides of metals of the
alkaline earths, is formed (Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_63_893">63</a>).</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">SILICON AND THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE FOURTH GROUP</span></h2>

<p>Carbon, which gives the compounds CH<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>, belongs to the
fourth group of elements. The nearest element to carbon is silicon,
which forms the compounds SiH<sub>4</sub> and SiO<sub>2</sub>; its relation to carbon is
like that of aluminium to boron or phosphorus to nitrogen. As carbon
composes the principal and most essential part of animal and vegetable
substances, so is silicon almost an invariable component part of the
rocky formations of the earth's crust. Silicon hydride, SiH<sub>4</sub>, like CH<sub>4</sub>,
has no acid properties, but silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, shows feeble acid properties
like carbonic anhydride. In a free state silicon is also a non-volatile,
slightly energetic non-metal, like carbon. Therefore the form and
nature of the compounds of carbon and silicon are very similar. In
addition to this resemblance, silicon presents one exceedingly important
distinction from carbon: namely, the nature of the higher degree of
oxidation. That is, silica, silicon dioxide, or silicic anhydride, SiO<sub>2</sub> is
a solid, non-volatile, and exceedingly infusible substance, very unlike
carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, which is a gas. This expresses the essential
peculiarity of silicon. The cause of this distinction may be most
probably sought for in the polymeric composition of silica compared
with carbonic anhydride. The molecule of carbonic anhydride contains
CO<sub>2</sub>, as seen by the density of this gas. The molecular weight
and vapour density of silica, were it volatile, would probably correspond
with the formula SiO<sub>2</sub>, but it might be imagined that it would correspond
to a far higher atomic weight of Si<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>, principally from the
fact that SiH<sub>4</sub> is a gas like CH<sub>4</sub>, and SiCl<sub>4</sub> is a liquid and volatile,
boiling at 57°&mdash;that is, even lower than CCl<sub>4</sub>, which boils at 76°. In
general, analogous compounds of silicon and carbon have nearly the
same boiling points if they are liquid and volatile.<a name="FNanchor_1_121" id="FNanchor_1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_121" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> From this it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
be expected that silicic anhydride, SiO<sub>2</sub>, would be a gas like carbonic
anhydride, whilst in reality silica is a hard non-volatile substance,<a name="FNanchor_1_BIS_122" id="FNanchor_1_BIS_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_BIS_122" class="fnanchor">[1 bis]</a>
and therefore it may with great certainty be considered that in this
condition it is polymeric with SiO<sub>2</sub>, as on polymerisation&mdash;for instance,
when cyanogen passes into paracyanogen, or hydrocyanic acid into
cyanuric acid (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_379">IX.</a>)&mdash;very frequently gaseous or volatile
substances change into solid, non-volatile, and physically denser and
more complex substances.<a name="FNanchor_2_123" id="FNanchor_2_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_123" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> We will first make acquaintance with free
silicon and its volatile compounds, as substances in which the analogy
of silicon with carbon is shown, not only in a chemical but also in a
physical sense.<a name="FNanchor_3_124" id="FNanchor_3_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_124" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Free silicon can be obtained in an amorphous or crystalline state.
Amorphous silicon is produced, like aluminium, by decomposing the
double fluoride of sodium and silicon (sodium silicofluoride) by means
of sodium: Na<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub> + 4Na = 6NaF + Si. By treating the mass thus
obtained with water the sodium fluoride may be extracted and the
residue will consist of brown, powdery silicon. In order to free it from
any silica which might be formed, it is treated with hydrofluoric acid.
This silicon powder is not lustrous; when heated it easily ignites, but
does not completely burn. It fuses when very strongly heated, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
has then the appearance of carbon.<a name="FNanchor_4_125" id="FNanchor_4_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_125" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Crystalline silicon is obtained in
a similar way, but by substituting an excess of aluminium for the
sodium: 3Na<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub> + 4Al = 6NaF + 4AlF<sub>3</sub> + 3Si. The part of the
aluminium remaining in the metallic state dissolves the silicon, and
the latter separates from the solution on cooling in a crystalline form.
The excess of aluminium after the fusion is removed by means of hydrochloric
and hydrofluoric acid. The best silicon crystals are obtained
from molten zinc; 15 parts of sodium silicofluoride are mixed with
20 parts of zinc and 4 parts of sodium, and the mixture is thrown
into a strongly heated crucible, a layer of common salt being used to
cover it; when the mass fuses it is stirred, cooled, treated with
hydrochloric acid, and then washed with nitric acid. Silicon, especially
when crystalline, like graphite and charcoal, does not in any way act
on the above-mentioned acids. It forms black, very brilliant, regular
octahedra having a specific gravity of 2·49; it is a bad conductor of
electricity, and does not burn even in pure oxygen (but it burns in
gaseous fluorine). The only acid which acts on it is a mixture of hydrofluoric
and nitric acids; but caustic alkalis dissolve in it like aluminium,
with evolution of hydrogen, thus showing its acid character. In
general silicon strongly resists the action of reagents, as do also boron
and carbon. Crystalline silicon was obtained in 1855 by Deville, and
amorphous silicon in 1826 by Berzelius.<a name="FNanchor_4_BIS_126" id="FNanchor_4_BIS_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_BIS_126" class="fnanchor">[4 bis]</a></p>

<p>Silicon hydride, SiH<sub>4</sub>, analogous to marsh gas was obtained first
of all in an impure state, mixed with hydrogen, by two methods: by
the action of an alloy of silicon and magnesium on hydrochloric acid,<a name="FNanchor_5_127" id="FNanchor_5_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_127" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
and by the action of the galvanic current on dilute sulphuric acid,
using electrodes of aluminium, containing silicon. In these cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
silicon hydride is set free, together with hydrogen, and the presence
of the hydride is shown by the fact that the hydrogen separated
ignites spontaneously on coming into contact with the air, forming
water and silica. The formation of silicon hydride by the action
of hydrochloric acid on magnesium silicide is perfectly akin to the
formation of phosphuretted hydrogen by the action of hydrochloric
acid on calcium phosphide, to the formation of hydrogen sulphide by
the action of acids on many metallic sulphides, and to the formation
of hydrocarbons by the action of hydrochloric acid on white cast
iron. On heating silicon hydride&mdash;that is, on passing it through an
incandescent tube, it is decomposed into silicon and hydrogen, just like
the hydrocarbons, but the caustic alkalis, although without action
on the latter, react with silicon hydride according to the equation:
SiH<sub>4</sub> + 2KHO + H<sub>2</sub>O = SiK<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p><i>Silicon chloride</i>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, is obtained from amorphous anhydrous silica
(made by igniting the hydrate) mixed with charcoal,<a name="FNanchor_6_128" id="FNanchor_6_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_128" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> heated to a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
heat in a stream of dry chlorine&mdash;that is, by that general method by which
many other chloranhydrides having acid properties are obtained. Silicon
chloride is purified from free chlorine by distillation over metallic mercury.
Free silicon forms the same substance when treated with dry chlorine.
It is a volatile colourless liquid, which boils at 59° and has a specific
gravity of 1·52. It fumes strongly in air, has a pungent smell, and in
general has the characteristic properties of the acid chloranhydrides.
It is completely decomposed by water, forming hydrochloric acid and
silicic acid, according to the equation: SiCl<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = Si(OH)<sub>4</sub> + 4HCl.<a name="FNanchor_7_129" id="FNanchor_7_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_129" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The most remarkable of the haloid compounds of silicon is <i>silicon
fluoride</i>, SiF<sub>4</sub>. It is a gaseous substance only liquefied by intense cold,
-100°, and is obtained (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_459">XI.</a>) directly by the action of hydrofluoric
acid on silica and its compounds (SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4HF = 2H<sub>2</sub>O + SiF<sub>4</sub>), and
also by heating fluorspar with silica (2CaF<sub>2</sub> + 3SiO<sub>2</sub> = 2CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + SiF<sub>4</sub>).<a name="FNanchor_8_130" id="FNanchor_8_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_130" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
In order to prepare silicon fluoride, sand or broken glass is mixed with
an equal quantity by weight of fluorspar and 6 parts by weight of
strong sulphuric acid, and the mixture is gently heated. It fumes
strongly in air, reacting with the aqueous vapours, although it is produced
from silica and hydrofluoric acid with the separation of water.
It is evident that a reverse reaction occurs here; that is to say,
the water reacts with the silicon fluoride, but the reaction is
not complete. This phenomenon is similar to that which occurs
when water decomposes aluminium chloride, but at the same time
hydrochloric acid dissolves aluminium hydroxide and forms the same
aluminium chloride. The relative amount of water present (together
with the temperature) determines the limit and direction of the
reaction. The faculty which silicon fluoride has of reacting with
water is so great that it takes up the elements of water from many
substances&mdash;for instance, like sulphuric acid, it chars paper. Water
dissolves about 300 volumes of this gas, but in this case it is not a
common dissolution which takes place, but a reaction. During the first
absorption of silicon fluoride by water, silicic acid is separated in the
form of a jelly, but a certain quantity of the silicon fluoride also
remains in the liquid, because the hydrofluoric acid formed dissolves
the other part of the silica<a name="FNanchor_9_131" id="FNanchor_9_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_131" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and forms the so-called <i>hydrofluosilicic</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<i>acid</i>: H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub> = SiF<sub>4</sub> + 2HF = SiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 6HF - 3H<sub>2</sub>O.  That is to say,
a metasilicic acid, SiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in which O<sub>3</sub> is replaced by F<sub>6</sub>. This
view of the composition of hydrofluosilicic acid may be admitted,
because it forms a whole series of crystallisable and well defined
salts. In general, the whole reaction of water on silicon fluoride may
be expressed by the equation: 3SiF<sub>4</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub> + 2SiH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>.
Hydrofluosilicic acid and silicic acid resemble each other as much, and
differ as much, in their chemical character as water and hydrofluoric
acid. For this reason silicic acid is a feebler acid than hydrofluosilicic
acid, and in addition to this the former is insoluble, and the latter
soluble, in water.<a name="FNanchor_10_132" id="FNanchor_10_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_132" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Hydrofluosilicic acid is also formed if silicic acid
be dissolved in a solution of hydrofluoric acid. It is incapable of
volatilising without decomposition, and on heating the concentrated
acid silicon fluoride is evolved, leaving an aqueous solution of hydrofluoric
acid. This is the reason why solutions of hydrofluosilicic acid
corrode glass. This decomposition may be further accelerated by the
addition of sulphuric acid, or even of other acids. Hydrofluosilicic acid,
when acting on potassium and barium salts, gives precipitates, because
the salts of these metals are but sparingly soluble in water: thus
2KX + H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub> = 2HX + K<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>. The potassium salt is obtained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the form of very fine octahedra, but the precipitate does not form
quickly, and at first appears as a jelly. Nevertheless, the decomposition
is complete, and it is taken advantage of for obtaining their corresponding
acids from salts of potassium.<a name="FNanchor_10_BIS_133" id="FNanchor_10_BIS_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_BIS_133" class="fnanchor">[10 bis]</a></p>

<p>Silicon, having so much in common with carbon, is also able to
combine with it in the proportion given by the law of substitution,
that is, it forms a carbide of silicon CSi, called <i>carborundum</i>  and
obtained by Mühlhäuser and Acheson in the United States, and by
Moissan in France (1891), and others, by reducing silica with carbon in
the electrical furnace at a temperature of about 2500°<a name="FNanchor_11_134" id="FNanchor_11_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_134" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, <i>i.e.</i> by the
action of an electrical current upon a mixture of carbon and SiO<sub>2</sub>
with NaCl. After treating the resultant mass with acids and washing
with water, carborundum is obtained in transparent, lustrous grains
of a greenish color, possessing great hardness (greater than corundum)
and therefore used for polishing the hardest kinds of steel and stones.
The specific gravity is about 3·1. Carborundum does not alter at a
red heat, does not burn, and apparently approaches the diamond in
its properties. (Moissan obtained, 1894, a similar very hard compound
for boron, B<sub>6</sub>C, sp. gr. 2·5.)</p>

<p>According to the principle of substitution, if silicon forms SiH<sub>4</sub>,
a series of hydrates, or hydroxyl derivatives, ought to exist
corresponding to it. The first hydrate of an alcoholic character
ought to have the composition SiH<sub>3</sub>(OH); the second hydrate
SiH<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>; the third, SiH(OH)<sub>3</sub>;<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_135" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_135" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a> and the last, Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
last is a hydrate of silica, because it is equal to SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O); and it
is formed by the action of water on silicon chloride, when all four
atoms of chlorine are replaced by four hydroxyl groups. It does not,
however, remain in this state, but easily loses part of its water.</p>

<p>Silica or silicic anhydride, both in the free state and in combination
with other oxides, enters into the composition of most of the rocky
formations of the earth's crust. These silicious compounds are substances
varying so much in their properties, crystalline forms, and relations
to one another that they are comprised in a special branch of
natural science (like the carbon compounds), and are treated of in
works on mineralogy; so that, in dealing with them further, we shall
only give a short description of these various compounds. It is first
of all necessary to turn to the description of silica itself, especially as
it is not unfrequently met with in nature in a separate state, and often
forms whole masses of rocky formations, called &lsquo;quartz.&rsquo; In an anhydrous
condition silica appears in the greatest variety of natural forms&mdash;sometimes
in well-formed crystals, hexagonal prisms, terminated by
hexagonal pyramids. If the crystals are colourless and transparent,
they are called <i>rock crystal</i>. This is the purest form of silica. Prismatic
crystals of rock crystal sometimes attain considerable size, and
as they are remarkable for their unchangeability, great hardness, and
high index of refraction, they are used for ornaments, for seals,
making necklaces, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_12_136" id="FNanchor_12_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_136" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Rock crystal coloured with organic matter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
contact with which it has been produced has a brown or greyish colour,
and then bears the name of <i>cairngorm</i> or <i>smoky quartz</i>. In this form it
has the same uses as rock crystal, especially as it is often found in large
masses. The same mineral, frequently occurs, coloured red or pink by
manganese or iron oxides, especially in aqueous formations, and is
then known as <i>amethyst</i>. When finely coloured the amethyst is used
as a precious stone, but amethysts most frequently occur as small
crystals in the cavities formed in other rocky formations, and especially
in those formed in silica itself. A similar anhydrous silica
is often found in transparent non-crystalline masses, having the
same specific gravity as rock crystal itself (2·66). In this case it
is called <i>quartz</i>. Sometimes it forms complete rocky formations, but
more often penetrates or is interspersed through other rocky formations,
together with other siliceous compounds. Thus, in granite,
quartz is mixed with felspar and similar substances. Sometimes the
colouring of quartz is so considerable that it is hardly transparent in
thin sheets, but it is often found in transparent masses slightly coloured
with various tints. The existence in nature of enormous masses of quartz
proves that it resists the action of water. When water destroys rocky
formations, the siliceous minerals which they contain are partly dissolved
and partly transformed into clay, &amp;c. But the quartz remains
untouched, in the form of grains in which it existed in the rocky
formation; sometimes, when crushed, it is carried away by the water
and deposited. This is the nature of <i>sand</i>. Naturally, sometimes
other rocky substances which are not changed by water, or only
slightly acted on by it, are found in sand; but as these latter are more
or less changed by the continuous action of water, it is not unusual to
find sand which consists almost entirely of pure quartz. Common sand
is generally coloured yellow or reddish-brown by foreign mineral matter,
consisting principally of ferruginous minerals and clays. The purest
or so-called quartz sand is, however, rarely found, and is recognised by
the absence of colour, and also by the test that when shaken in water
it does not form any turbidity: this shows the absence of clay; when
fused with bases it forms a colourless glass, and on this account is a
valuable material for the manufacture of glass. Sands were formed at
all periods of the earth's existence; the ancient ones, compressed by
strata of more recent formation and permeated with various substances
(deposited from the infiltrating water), are sometimes solidified into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
rock, called <i>sandstone</i>, composing, in some places, whole mountain
chains, and serviceable as a most excellent building material, on account
of the slight change it undergoes under the influence of atmospheric
agencies, and on account of the facility with which it may be wrought
from rocky formations into immense regularly-shaped flags&mdash;the latter
property is due to the primary laminar structure of the sand formations
deposited, as above-mentioned, by water. Many grindstones and whetstones
are made from such rocks.</p>

<p>Perfectly pure anhydrous silica is not only known in the condition
of rock crystal and quartz having a specific gravity of 2·6, but
also in another special form, having other chemical and physical properties.
This variety of silica has a specific gravity of 2·2, and is
formed by fusing rock crystal or heating silicic acid.<a name="FNanchor_12_BIS_137" id="FNanchor_12_BIS_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_BIS_137" class="fnanchor">[12 bis]</a> Silicic acid,
when heated to a dull red heat, parts entirely with the water it
contains, and leaves an exceedingly fine amorphous mass of silica (easily
levigated, but difficult to moisten); it is characterised by such excessive
friability that, when lightly blown on, a large mass of it rises into the
air like a cloud of dust. A mass of anhydrous silica maybe poured in
this way from one vessel to another like a liquid, and like the latter it
takes a horizontal position in the vessel containing it.<a name="FNanchor_13_138" id="FNanchor_13_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_138" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Anhydrous
silica, like quartz, does not fuse in the heat of a furnace, but it fuses in
the oxyhydrogen flame to a colourless glassy mass exactly similar to that
formed in the same way from rock crystal. In this condition silica has
a specific gravity of 2·2.<a name="FNanchor_13_BIS_139" id="FNanchor_13_BIS_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_BIS_139" class="fnanchor">[13 bis]</a> Both forms of silica are insoluble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
ordinary acids, and even when they are in the state of powder,
alkalis in solution act very slowly and feebly on them; rock crystal
offers much greater resistance to the action of alkalis than the
powder obtained by heating the hydrate. The latter is quite soluble,
although but slowly, in hot alkaline solutions. This last property
appertains in a greater degree to anhydrous silica having a specific
gravity of 2·2 than to that which has a specific gravity of 2·6. Hydrofluoric
acid more easily transforms the former into silicon fluoride than
it does the latter. Both varieties of silica, when taken in the form of
powder, easily combine with bases, forming, on being fused with
an alkali, a vitreous slag, which is a salt corresponding with silica.
Glass is such a salt, formed of alkalis and alkaline earthy bases; if
the glass does not contain any of the latter&mdash;that is, if only alkaline
glass be taken&mdash;a mass soluble in water is obtained. In order to obtain
such <i>soluble glass</i>, potassium or sodium carbonates, or better a mixture
of the two (fusion mixture), is fused with fine sand. A still better
and further saturation of the alkalis with silica is effected by the action
of alkaline solutions on the silicon hydrate met with in nature; for
instance, an alkaline solution is often made use of to act on the so-called
<i>tripoli</i>, or collection of siliceous skeletons of the lowest microscopical
infusoria, which is sometimes found in considerable layers in
the form of a sandy mass. Tripoli is used for polishing, not only on
account of the considerable hardness of the silica, but also because
the microscopic bodies of the infusoria have a pointed shape, which,
however, is not angular, so that they do not scratch metals like
sand.<a name="FNanchor_14_140" id="FNanchor_14_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_140" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The alkaline solutions of silica obtained by boiling tripoli with
caustic soda under pressure contain various proportions of silica
and alkali.<a name="FNanchor_14_BIS_141" id="FNanchor_14_BIS_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_BIS_141" class="fnanchor">[14 bis]</a> In order that it may contain the greatest amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
silica, silicic acid should be added to the heated solution. Silicic
acid is formed by taking any solution containing silica and alkali,
and adding to it, by degrees, some acid&mdash;for instance, sulphuric
or hydrochloric; if the experiment be carried on carefully and
the solution be concentrated, the whole mass thickens to a jelly,
due to the gelatinous form of the <i>silicic acid</i> separated from the
salt by the action of the acid. The decomposition may be expressed
by the following equation:  Si(ONa)<sub>4</sub> + 4HCl = 4NaCl + Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>.
The hydrate separated, Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, easily loses part of the water and
forms a jelly, the whole mass gelatinising if the solution be strong
enough.<a name="FNanchor_15_142" id="FNanchor_15_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_142" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Neither of the two varieties of anhydrous silica, nor the various
natural gelatinous hydrates, are directly soluble in water. There is,
however, a condition of silica known which is soluble in water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
<i>soluble silica</i>, and silica is found in this state in nature. Small
quantities of soluble silica are met with in all waters. Certain mineral
springs, and especially hot springs&mdash;of which the best known are the
Geysers of Iceland and those in the North American National Park
(Yellowstone Valley)&mdash;contain a considerable amount of silica in solution.
Such water, permeating the objects it meets with&mdash;for instance,
wood&mdash;penetrates into them and deposits silica inside them, that is,
transforms them into a petrified condition. Siliceous stalactites,
and also many (if not all) forms of silica are formed by such water.
The absorption of silica by plants by means of their roots, and
also by the lower organisms having siliceous bodies, is due also to
their nourishing themselves with the solutions containing silica
continually formed in nature. Thus, in plants, in the straws of
the grasses, in hard shave-grass, and especially in the knots of
bamboo and other straw-like plants, a considerable quantity of
silica is deposited, which must previously have been absorbed by the
plants.</p>

<p>Silicic acid is a colloid. The gelatinous silicon hydrate is its
hydrogel, the soluble hydrate is the hydrosol (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_513">XII.</a>) Both
varieties may be easily obtained from the alkaline silicates and from
water-glass. The very same substances&mdash;that is, aqueous solutions of
soluble glass and acid&mdash;taken in the same proportion, may produce
either the gelatinous or the soluble silica, according to the way these
solutions are mixed together. If the acid be added little by little to the
<i>alkaline silicate</i>, with continuous stirring, a moment arrives when the
whole mass thickens to a jelly, hydrogel; in this case the silicic acid is
formed in the midst of the alkaline solution and becomes insoluble.
But if the mixing be done in the reverse order&mdash;that is, if the soluble
glass be added to the acid, or if a quantity of acid be rapidly poured into
the solution of the salt&mdash;then the separation of the silica takes place
in the midst of the acid liquid, and it is obtained in the form of the
soluble hydrate, the hydrosol.<a name="FNanchor_16_143" id="FNanchor_16_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_143" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The hydrosol of silica prepared by mixing an excess of hydrochloric
acid with a solution of sodium silicate, may be freed from the admixtures
both of hydrochloric acid and salt, sodium chloride, <i>by means of
dialysis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_17_144" id="FNanchor_17_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_144" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> as Graham showed (in 1861) in enquiring into the nature of
colloids (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_40">I.</a>), and making many other important chemical investigations.
The solution, containing the acid, salt, and silica, all
dissolved in water, is poured into a dialyser&mdash;that is, a vessel with a
porous diaphragm surrounded by water. Certain substances pass more
easily through the diaphragm than others. This may be represented
thus: the passage through the diaphragm proceeds in both directions,
and if the solutions on each side of the diaphragm be equally strong,
there will be equal numbers of molecules of the soluble substance
passing into either side in a given time, some passing quickly and
others slowly. The metallic chlorides and hydrochloric acid belong to
the series of crystalloids which easily pass through a diaphragm, and
therefore the hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride contained in the
above-mentioned dialyser pass from the solution through the diaphragm
into the water of the external vessel with considerable rapidity. The
aqueous solution of colloidal silica also penetrates through the diaphragm,
but very much more slowly. But if the amount of the substance
dissolved is not equal on either side of the diaphragm, the whole
system strives to attain a state of equilibrium; that is, the given
substance penetrates through the diaphragm from the side where it
is in excess to the part where there is a smaller quantity of it. All substances
which are soluble in water have the faculty of penetrating
through a membrane swollen in water, but the velocity of penetration
is not equal, and in this respect the dialyser separates substances like
a sieve. The silica passes less rapidly through the diaphragm than the
sodium chloride and hydrochloric acid, so that by repeatedly changing
the external water it is easy to effect the extraction of the chlorine
compounds from the dialyser, which will finally only contain a solution
of silica. This extraction (of HCl and NaCl) may be so complete that
the liquid taken from the dialyser will not give any precipitate with a
solution of silver nitrate. Graham obtained in this way soluble silica
having a distinctly acid reaction, which, however, disappeared on the
addition of a very minute quantity of alkali; for ten parts of silica in
the solution it was sufficient to take one part of alkali in order to give the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
liquid an alkaline reaction, so slightly energetic are the acid properties
of silicic acid. The solution of silica obtained by this method becomes
gelatinous on standing, on being heated, or on evaporation under the
receiver of an air-pump, &amp;c. The hydrosol is transformed into the
hydrogel, the soluble hydrate into the gelatinous.</p>

<p>Thus in addition to the gelatinous form of the silicic acid, there
exists also a variety of this substance, soluble in water, as is the case
with alumina. Such variation in properties and exactly the same relations
with regard to water characterise an immense series of other
substances having a great significance in nature. The number of such
substances is especially great among organic compounds, and particularly
in those classes of them which compose the principal material
of the bodies of animals and plants. It is sufficient to mention, for
instance, the gelatin which is familiar to all as carpenter's and other
glues, and in the form of size and jelly. The same substance is also
known in the solution which is used to join objects together. In a
peculiar insoluble condition it enters into the composition of hides and
bones. These various forms of gelatin differ in the same way as the
different varieties of silica. The property of forming a jelly is exactly
the same as in silica, and the adhesiveness of the solutions of both substances
is identical; soluble silica adheres like a solution of gelatin.
The same properties are again shown by starch, rosin, and albumin,
and by a series of similar substances. The diaphragms used in dialysis
are also insoluble, gelatinous, forms of colloids. The bodies of
animals and plants consist largely of similar matter, insoluble in water,
corresponding with the gelatinous or insoluble silicon hydrate, or with
glue. The albumin which coagulates when eggs are boiled is a typical
form of the gelatinous condition of such substances in the body.
These slight indications are sufficient in order to show how great is
the significance of those transformations which are so well marked
in silica. The facts discovered by <i>Graham</i> in 1861&ndash;1864 comprise the
most essential acquisitions in the general association of these phenomena
of nature in the history of organic forms. The facility of transit
from hydrogel to hydrosol is the first condition of the possibility of
the development of organisms. The blood contains hydrosols, and the
hydrogels of the same substances are contained in the muscles and tissues,
and especially on the surface, of the body. All tissues are formed
from the blood, and in that case the hydrosols are converted into hydrogels.<a name="FNanchor_18_145" id="FNanchor_18_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_145" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
The absence of crystallisation, the property, apparently under
the influence of feeble agencies, of passing from the soluble condition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the insoluble, to the gelatinous condition of the hydrogel, constitute
the fundamental properties of all colloids.<a name="FNanchor_19_146" id="FNanchor_19_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_146" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Silica, as regards its <i>salt forming properties</i>, stands in the series
of oxides on the boundary line on the side of the acids in just such a
place as alumina occupies on the side of the bases&mdash;that is, aluminium
hydroxide is the representative of the feeblest bases and silicic acid
is the least energetic of acids (at least in the presence of water&mdash;that
is, in aqueous solutions); in alumina, however, the basic properties
are distinctly expressed, while in silica the acid properties preponderate.
Like all feeble acid oxides it is capable of forming, with other acids,
saline compounds which are but slightly stable and are very easily
decomposed in the presence of water. The chief peculiarity of the silicates
consists in the number of their types. The salts formed with nitric or
sulphuric acid exist in one, two, and three tolerably stable forms, but
for acids like silicic acid the number of forms is very great, almost
unlimited. The natural silicates in particular furnish proof of this
fact; they contain various bases in combination with silica, and for
one and the same base there often exist various degrees of combination.
As feeble bases are capable of forming basic salts in addition to normal
salts&mdash;that is, a compound of a normal salt with a feeble base (either
the hydroxide or the oxide)&mdash;so the feeble acid oxides (although
not all) form, in addition to normal salts, highly acid salts&mdash;that is,
normal salts <i>plus</i> acid (hydrate or anhydride). Such acids are boric,
phosphoric, molybdic, chromic, and especially silicic, acid.</p>

<p>In order to explain these relations it is necessary first to recollect
the existence of the various hydrates of silica, or silicic acids,<a name="FNanchor_20_147" id="FNanchor_20_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_147" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to turn our attention to the similarity between silicon compounds and
metallic alloys. Silica is an oxide having the appearance of, and in
many respects the same properties as, those oxides which combine with
it, and if two metals are capable of forming homogeneous alloys in
which there exist definite or indefinite compounds, it is permissible to
assume a similar power of forming alloys in the case of analogous oxides.
Such alloys are found in indefinite, amorphous masses in the form of
glass, lava, slags, and a number of similar siliceous compounds which
do not contain any definite types of combination, but nevertheless are
homogeneous throughout their mass. By slow cooling, or under other
circumstances, definite crystalline compounds may&mdash;and sometimes do&mdash;separate
from this homogeneous mass, as also sometimes definite
crystalline alloys separate from metallic alloys.</p>

<p>The formation of crystalline rocks in nature is partly of such a
nature. By aqueous or igneous agency, but in any case in a liquid
condition, those oxides which form the earth's crust and her crystalline
minerals came into mutual contact. First of all they formed a shapeless
mass, of which lava, glass, slags and solutions are examples, but
little by little, or else suddenly, some definite compounds of certain
oxides existing in this alloy or in the shapeless mass were formed. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
is entirely similar to two metals forming a homogeneous alloy,<a name="FNanchor_21_148" id="FNanchor_21_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_148" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and
under known circumstances (for instance, on cooling the alloy, or in
the case of aqueous solution when the two metals are simultaneously
liberated from the solution), definite crystalline compounds are
separated. In any case there is no doubt that there is less distinction
between silica and bases, than between bases and such anhydrides
as, for instance, sulphuric or nitric, or even carbonic, as is seen on
comparing the physical and chemical properties of silica and various
kinds of oxides. Alumina, especially, is exceedingly near akin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
silica; not only in the hydrated state, but also in the anhydrous
condition, there exists a certain similarity between the crystalline forms
of alumina and silica, in the uncombined state. Both are very hard,
transparent, inactive, non-volatile, infusible, and crystallise in the
hexagonal system&mdash;in a word, they are remarkably similar, and for this
reason they are capable, like two kindred metals, of entering into many
different degrees of combination. Isomorphous mixtures&mdash;that is, differing
by the substitution of oxides akin both in their physical and chemical
characters&mdash;are very frequently met with among minerals, and the
study of the latter gave the principal impetus to the study of isomorphism.
Thus, in a whole series of minerals, lime and magnesia are
found in variable and interchangeable proportions. Exactly the same
may be said of potassium and sodium, of alumina and ferric oxide,
of manganous, ferrous, magnesium oxides, &amp;c. Such isomorphism
does not, however, extend without change of form and properties
beyond certain rather narrow limits.<a name="FNanchor_22_149" id="FNanchor_22_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_149" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> What I mean by this is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
lime is not always replaced totally, but often only in small quantities,
by magnesia, or by the manganous and ferrous oxides, without changing
the crystalline form. The same may be observed with regard to potassium
and lithium, which may be in part, but not completely, replaced by
sodium. On the total substitution of one metal for another, often
(although not invariably) the entire nature of the substance is changed;
for instance, <i>enstatite</i> (or bronzite) is a magnesium bisilicate with a
small isomorphous substitution of calcium for magnesium; its composition
is expressed by the formula MgSiO<sub>3</sub>, it belongs to the rhombic
system. On the entire substitution of calcium, <i>wollastonite</i>, CaSiO<sub>3</sub>,
of the monoclinic system, is obtained; when manganese is substituted,
<i>rhodonite</i>, of the triclinic system, is produced; but in all of them the
angles of the prism are 86° to 88°.<a name="FNanchor_23_150" id="FNanchor_23_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_150" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The most remarkable complex siliceous compounds are the <i>felspars</i>,
which enter into nearly all the primary rocks like porphyry, granite,
gneiss, &amp;c. These felspars always contain, in addition to silica and
alumina, oxides presenting more marked basic properties, such as potash,
soda, and lime. Thus the <i>orthoclase</i> (adularia), or ordinary felspar
(monoclinic) of the granites, contains K<sub>2</sub>O,Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,6SiO<sub>2</sub>; <i>albite</i> contains
the same substances, only with Na<sub>2</sub>O instead of K<sub>2</sub>O (it already appertains
to the triclinic system); <i>anorthite</i> contains lime, and its composition
is CaO,Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2SiO<sub>2</sub>. On expressing the two last as containing
equal quantities of oxygen, we have:&mdash;</p>

  </tr>

<p class="noindent">It is then evident that on the conversion of albite into anorthite, Na<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>
is replaced by Ca<sub>2</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>, and this sum, both in chemical energy and in the
form of oxide, may be considered as corresponding with the first, because
sodium and silicon are extreme elements in chemical character (from
groups I. and IV.), and calcium and aluminium are means between
them (from groups II. and III.), and actually both these felspar minerals
are not only of one (triclinic) system, but form (Tchermak,
Schuster) all possible kinds of definite compounds (isomorphous
mixtures) between themselves, as indicated by their composition and
all their properties. Thus oligoclase, andesine, labradorite, &amp;c. (plagioclases),
are nothing more than mutual combinations of albite and
anorthite. Labradorite consists of albite, in combination with 1 to 2 molecules
of anorthite. The class of <i>zeolites</i> corresponds to the felspars; they
are hydrated compounds of a similar composition to the felspars. Thus
<i>natrolite</i> contains Na<sub>2</sub>O,Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3SiO<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and <i>analcime</i> presents the
same composition, but contains 4SiO<sub>2</sub> instead of 3SiO<sub>2</sub>. In general,
the felspars and zeolites contain RO,Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,<i>n</i>SiO<sub>2</sub>, where <i>n</i> varies considerably.<a name="FNanchor_24_151" id="FNanchor_24_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_151" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Such complex silicates are generally insoluble in water,<a name="FNanchor_25_152" id="FNanchor_25_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_152" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a><br /><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
they undergo change in it, it is but very slow, and more often only in
the presence of carbonic acid. Some of the silicates which are insoluble
in water are easily and directly decomposed by acids; for instance, the
zeolites and those fused silicates which contain a large quantity of
energetic bases&mdash;such as lime. Many of the silicates, like glass,<a name="FNanchor_26_153" id="FNanchor_26_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_153" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
hardly changed by acids, particularly if they contain much silica,
whilst fusion with alkalis leads to the formation of compounds rich in
bases, after which acids decompose the alloys formed.<a name="FNanchor_27_154" id="FNanchor_27_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_154" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>According to the periodic law, the nearest analogues of silicon ought
to be elements of the uneven series, because silicon, like sodium, magnesium,
and aluminium, belongs to the uneven series.<a name="FNanchor_28_155" id="FNanchor_28_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_155" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Immediately
after silicon follows ekasilicon or <i>germanium</i>, Ge = 72, whose properties
were predicted (1871) before Winkler (1886) in Freiberg, Saxony
(Chapter XV. <a href="#Page_24">§ 5</a>), discovered this element in a peculiar silver ore called
<i>argyrodite</i>, Ag<sub>6</sub>GeS<sub>5</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_29_156" id="FNanchor_29_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_156" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Easily reduced from the oxide by heating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
hydrogen and charcoal, and separated from its solutions by zinc,
metallic germanium proved to be greyish white, easily crystallisable (in
octahedra), brittle, fusible (under a coating of fused borax) at about
900°, and easily oxidisable; the specific gravity = 5·469, the atomic
weight = 72·3, and the specific heat = 0·076,<a name="FNanchor_30_157" id="FNanchor_30_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_157" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> as might be expected
for this element according to the periodic law. The corresponding
<i>germanium dioxide</i>, GeO<sub>2</sub>, is a white powder having a specific gravity
of 4·703; water, especially when boiling, dissolves this dioxide (1 part
of GeO<sub>2</sub> requires for solution 247 parts of water at 20°, 95 parts at
100°). It forms soluble salts with alkalis and is but sparingly soluble
in acids.<a name="FNanchor_31_158" id="FNanchor_31_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_158" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In a stream of chlorine the metal forms <i>germanium
chloride</i>, GeCl<sub>4</sub>, which boils at 86°, and has a specific gravity of
1·887 at 18°; water decomposes it, forming the oxide. All these properties<a name="FNanchor_32_159" id="FNanchor_32_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_159" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
of germanium, showing its analogy to silicon and tin, form a
most beautiful demonstration of the truth of the periodic law.<a name="FNanchor_33_160" id="FNanchor_33_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_160" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The increase of atomic weight from silicon 28 to germanium 72
is 44&mdash;that is, about the same difference as there is in the atomic
weights of chlorine and bromine; between germanium and its next
analogue, <i>tin</i> (Sn = 118), the difference is 46&mdash;that is, almost as much
as the amount by which the atomic weight of iodine exceeds that of
bromine.</p>

<p>Metallic tin is rarely met with in <i>nature</i>; it occurs in the veins of
ancient formations, almost exclusively in the form of oxide, SnO<sub>2</sub>, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<i>tin-stone</i>. The best known tin deposits are in Cornwall and in Malacca.
In Russia, tin ores have been found in small quantities on the shores of
Lake Ladoga, in Pitkarand. The crushed ore may easily be separated
from the earthy matter accompanying it by washing on inclined tables,
as the tin-stone has a specific gravity of 6·9, whilst the impurities are
much lighter. <i>Tin oxide is very easily reduced</i> to metallic tin by heating
with charcoal. For this reason tin was known in ancient times, and the
Ph&oelig;nicians brought it from England. Metallic tin is cast into ingots of
considerable weight or into thin sticks or rods. Tin has a white colour,
rather duller than that of silver. It fuses easily at 232°, and crystallises
on cooling. Its specific gravity is 7·29. The crystalline structure of
ordinary tin is noticed in bending tin rods, when a peculiar sound is
heard, produced by the fracture of the particles of tin along the surfaces
of crystalline structure.</p>

<p>When pure tin is cooled to a low temperature it splits up into
separate crystals, the bond between the particles is lost, the tin assumes
a grey colour, becomes less brilliant&mdash;in a word, its properties become
changed, as Fritzsche showed. This depends on the peculiar structure
which the tin then acquires, and is particularly remarkable because
it is effected by cold in a solid.<a name="FNanchor_33_BIS_161" id="FNanchor_33_BIS_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_BIS_161" class="fnanchor">[33 bis]</a> If such tin be fused, or even
simply heated, it becomes like ordinary tin, but is again changed when
cooled. When in this condition tin has a specific gravity of 7·19.
Similarly, tin is obtained by the action of the galvanic current on
a solution of tin chloride; it then appears in crystals of the cubic
system, and has a specific gravity of 7·18&mdash;that is, the same as when
cooled.<a name="FNanchor_34_162" id="FNanchor_34_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_162" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Tin is softer than silver and gold, and is only surpassed by lead in
this respect. In addition to this it is very ductile, but its tenacity is
very slight, so that wire made from it will bear but little strain. In
consequence of its ductility it is easily worked, by forging and rolling
into very thin sheets (tin foil), which are used for wrapping many
articles to preserve them from moisture, &amp;c. In this case, however,
and in many others, lead is mixed with the tin, which, within certain
limits, does not alter the ductility. Whilst so soft at the ordinary
temperatures tin becomes brittle at 200°, before fusing. Tin powder
may be easily obtained if the metal be fused and then stirred whilst
cooling. At a white heat tin may be distilled, but with more difficulty
than zinc. If molten tin comes into contact with oxygen, it oxidises,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
forming stannic oxide, SnO<sub>2</sub>, <i>and its vapour burns</i> with a white flame.
<i>At ordinary temperatures tin does not oxidise</i>, and this very important
property of tin allows it to be applied in many cases for covering other
metals to prevent their oxidising. This is termed <i>tinning</i>. Iron and
copper are frequently tinned. Iron and steel sheets, coated with tin,
bear the name of tin plate (for the most part made in England), and are
used for numerous purposes. Tin plate is prepared by immersing iron
sheets, previously thoroughly cleansed by acid and mechanical means,
into molten tin.<a name="FNanchor_34_BIS_163" id="FNanchor_34_BIS_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_BIS_163" class="fnanchor">[34 bis]</a></p>

<p>Tin with copper forms <i>bronze</i>, an alloy which is most extensively
used in the arts. Bronze has various colours and a variety of physical
properties, according to the relative amount of copper and tin
which it contains. With an excess of copper the alloy has a yellow
colour; the admixture of tin imparts considerable hardness and
elasticity to the copper. An alloy containing 78 parts of copper and
about 22 per cent. of tin is so elastic that it is used for casting bells,
which naturally require a very elastic and hard alloy.<a name="FNanchor_35_164" id="FNanchor_35_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_164" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> For casting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
statues and various large or small ornamental articles alloys containing
2 to 5 p.c. of tin, 10 to 30 p.c. of zinc, and 65 to 85 p.c. of copper are
used.<a name="FNanchor_36_165" id="FNanchor_36_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_165" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Tin is also often used alloyed with lead, for making various
objects&mdash;for instance, drinking vessels.</p>

<p>Tin decomposes the vapour of water when heated with it, liberating
the hydrogen and forming stannic oxide. Sulphuric acid, diluted with a
considerable quantity of water, does not act, or at all events acts very
slightly, on tin, but tin reduces hot strong sulphuric acid, when not
only sulphurous anhydride but also sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved.
Hydrochloric acid acts very easily on tin, with evolution of hydrogen
and formation of stannous chloride, SnCl<sub>2</sub>, in solution, which, with an
excess of hydrochloric acid and access of air, is converted into stannic
chloride: SnCl<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl + O = SnCl<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_36_BIS_166" id="FNanchor_36_BIS_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_BIS_166" class="fnanchor">[36 bis]</a> Nitric acid diluted
with a considerable quantity of water dissolves tin at the ordinary temperature,
whilst the nitric acid itself is reduced, forming, amongst other
products, ammonia and hydroxylamine. Here the tin passes into solution
in the form of stannous nitrate. Stronger nitric acid (also more
dilute, when heated) transforms the tin into its highest grade of oxidation,
SnO<sub>2</sub>, but the latter then appears as the so-called metastannic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
acid, which does not dissolve in nitric acid, and therefore the tin does
not pass into solution. Feeble acids&mdash;for instance, carbonic and organic
acids&mdash;do not act on tin even in the presence of oxygen, because tin does
not form any powerful bases.</p>

<p>It is important to remark as a characteristic of tin that it is reduced
from its solutions by many metals which are more easily oxidised,
as, for instance, by zinc.</p>

<p><i>In combination</i>, <i>tin</i> appears in the two types, SnX<sub>4</sub> and SnX<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_37_167" id="FNanchor_37_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_167" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
compounds of the intermediate type, Sn<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>, being also known, but these
latter pass with remarkable facility in most cases into compounds of
the higher and lower types, and therefore the form SnX<sub>3</sub> cannot be
considered as independent.</p>

<p><i>Stannous oxide</i>, SnO, in an anhydrous condition is obtained by
boiling solutions of stannous salts with alkalis, the first action of
the alkali being to precipitate a white hydrate of stannous oxide,
Sn(OH)<sub>2</sub>SnO. The latter when heated parts with water as easily as the
hydrate of copper oxide. In this form stannous oxide is a black crystalline
powder (specific gravity 6·7) capable of further oxidation when
heated. The hydrate is freely soluble in acids, and also in potassium
and sodium hydroxides, but not in aqueous ammonia.<a name="FNanchor_38_168" id="FNanchor_38_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_168" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> This property
indicates the feeble basic properties of this lower oxide, which acts in
many cases as a reducing agent.<a name="FNanchor_39_169" id="FNanchor_39_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_169" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Among the compounds corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
with stannous oxide the most remarkable and the one most frequently
used is stannous chloride or <i>chloride of tin</i>, SnCl<sub>2</sub>, also called proto-chloride
of tin (because it is the lowest chloride, containing half as
much Cl as SnCl<sub>4</sub>). It is a transparent, colourless, crystalline substance,
melting at 250° and boiling at 606°. Water dissolves it, without
visible change (in reality partial decomposition occurs, as we shall see
presently). It is also soluble in alcohol. It is obtained by heating tin
in dry hydrochloric acid gas, the hydrogen being then liberated, or
by dissolving metallic tin in hot strong hydrochloric acid and then
evaporating quickly. On cooling, crystals of the monoclinic system are
obtained having the composition SnCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. An aqueous solution of
this substance absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere, and gives a precipitate
containing stannic oxide. From this it follows that a solution of
stannous chloride will act as a reducing agent, a fact frequently made
use of in chemical investigations&mdash;for example, for reducing metals
from their solutions&mdash;since even mercury may be reduced to a metallic
state from its salts by means of stannous chloride. This reducing
property is also employed in the arts, especially in the dyeing industry,
where this substance in the form of a crystalline salt finds an extensive
application, and is known as <i>tin salt</i> or tin crystals.</p>

<p><i>Stannic oxide</i>, SnO<sub>2</sub>, occurring in nature as <i>tin-stone</i>, or <i>cassiterite</i>, is
formed during the oxidation or combustion of heated tin in air as a
white or yellowish powder which fuses with difficulty. It is prepared
in large quantities, being used as a white vitreous mixture for coating
ordinary tiles and similar earthenware objects with a layer of
easily fusible glass or enamel. Acid solutions of stannic oxide treated
with alkalis, and alkaline solutions treated with acids, give a precipitate
of stannic hydroxide, Sn(OH)<sub>4</sub>, also known as stannic acid,
which, when heated, gives up water and leaves the anhydride, SnO<sub>2</sub>,
which is insoluble in acids, clearly showing the feebleness of its basic
character. When fused with alkali hydroxides (not with their carbonates
or acid sulphates), an alkaline compound is obtained which is
soluble in water. Stannic hydroxide, like the hydrates of silica, is a
colloidal substance, and presents several different modifications, depending
on the method of preparation, but having an identical composition;
the various hydroxides have also a different appearance, and
act differently with reagents. For instance, a distinction is made
between ordinary stannic acid and metastannic acid. <i>Stannic acid</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
produced by precipitation by soda or ammonia from a freshly-prepared
solution of stannic chloride, SnCl<sub>4</sub>, in water; on drying the precipitate
thus obtained, a non-crystalline mass is formed, which is freely soluble
in strong hydrochloric or nitric acids, and also in potassium and sodium
hydroxides. This ordinary stannic acid may be still better obtained
from sodium stannate by the action of acids. <i>Metastannic acid</i> is
insoluble in sulphuric and nitric acids. It is obtained in the form of
a heavy white powder by treating tin with nitric acid; hydrochloric
acid does not dissolve it immediately, but changes it to such an extent
that, after pouring off the acid, water extracts the stannic chloride,
SnCl<sub>4</sub>, already formed. Dilute alkalis not only dissolve metastannic
acid, but also transform it into salts, which, slowly, yet completely,
dissolve in <i>pure water</i>, but are insoluble even in dilute alkali
hydroxides. Dilute hydrochloric acid, especially when boiling, changes
the ordinary hydrate into metastannic acid. On this depends, by
the way, the formation of a white precipitate, stannic hydroxide, from
solutions of stannous and stannic chlorides diluted with water. The
stannic oxide first dissolved changes under the influence of hydrochloric
acid into metastannic acid, which is insoluble in water in the
presence of hydrochloric acid. Solutions of metastannic acid differ
from solutions of ordinary stannic acid, and in the presence of alkali
they change into solutions of ordinary acid, so that metastannic acid
corresponds principally with the acid compounds of stannic oxide,
and ordinary stannic acid with the alkaline compounds.<a name="FNanchor_40_170" id="FNanchor_40_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_170" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Graham
obtained a soluble colloidal hydroxide; it is subject to the same transformations
that are in general peculiar to colloids.</p>

<p>Stannic oxide shows the properties of a slightly energetic and intermediate
oxide (like water, silica, &amp;c.); that is to say, it forms saline
compounds both with bases and with acids, but both are easily decomposed,
and are but slightly stable. But still the acid character is
more clearly developed than the basic, as in silica, germanic oxide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and lead dioxide. This determines the character of the compounds
SnX<sub>4</sub>, corresponding to stannic chloride, SnCl<sub>4</sub> (also called tetrachloride
of tin). It is obtained in an anhydrous condition by the direct action
of chlorine on tin, and is then easily purified, because it is a liquid
boiling at 114°, and therefore can be easily distilled. Its specific
gravity is 2·28 (at 0°), and it fumes in the open air (spiritus fumans
libavii), reacting on the moisture of the air, thus showing the
properties of a chloranhydride. Water however does not at first
decompose it, but dissolves it, and on evaporation gives the crystallo-hydrate
SnCl<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O. If but little water be taken, crystals containing
SnCl<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O are formed, which part with one-third of the water when
placed under the receiver of the air-pump. A large quantity of water
however, especially on heating, causes a precipitate of metastannic
acid<a name="FNanchor_41_171" id="FNanchor_41_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_171" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and formation of HCl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The alkali compounds of stannic oxide</i>&mdash;that is, the compounds in
which it plays the part of an acid, corresponding in this respect to the
compounds of silica and other anhydrides of the composition RO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;are
very easily formed and are used in the arts. Their composition in
most cases corresponds with the formula SnM<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, SnO(MO)<sub>2</sub>,
similar to CO(MO)<sub>2</sub>, where M = K, Na. Acids, even feeble acids like
carbonic, decompose the salts, like the corresponding compounds of alumina
or silica. In order to obtain <i>potassium stannate</i>, which crystallises
in rhombohedra, and has the composition SnK<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, potassium
hydroxide (8 parts) is fused, and metastannic acid (3 parts) gradually
added. <i>Sodium stannate</i> is prepared in practice in large quantities by
heating a solution of caustic soda with lead oxide and metallic tin.
In this last case an alkaline solution of lead oxide is formed, and the tin
acts on the solution in such a way as to reduce the lead to the metallic
state, and itself passes into solution. It is very remarkable that lead
displaces tin when in combination with acids, whilst tin, on the contrary,
displaces lead from its alkali compounds. By dissolving the
mass obtained in water, and adding alcohol, sodium stannate is precipitated,
which may then be dissolved in water and purified by
re-crystallisation. In this case it has the composition SnNa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O
if separated from strong solutions, and SnNa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O when crystallised
at a low temperature from dilute solutions. In the arts this
salt is used as a mordant in dyeing operations. With a cold solution
of sodium hydroxide metastannic acid forms a salt of the composition
(NaHO)<sub>2</sub>,5SnO<sub>2</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, from which Frémy drew his conclusions concerning
the polymerism of metastannic acid. Tin, like other metals
and many metalloids, gives a peroxide form of combination or <i>perstannic
oxide</i>. This substance was obtained by Spring (1889) in the
form of a hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> = 2(SnO<sub>3</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>O, by mixing a solution of
SnCl<sub>2</sub>, containing an excess of HCl, with freshly prepared peroxide
of barium. A cloudy liquid is then obtained, and this after being
subjected to dialysis leaves a gelatinous mass which on drying is
found to have the composition Sn<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. Above 100° this substance
gives off oxygen and leaves SnO<sub>2</sub>. It is evident that SnO<sub>3</sub> bears
the same relation to SnO<sub>2</sub> as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O or ZnO<sub>2</sub> to ZnO, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Tin occupies the same position amongst the analogues of silicon as
cadmium and indium amongst the analogues of magnesium and
aluminium respectively, and as in each of these cases the heavier
analogues with a high atomic weight and a special combination of
properties&mdash;namely, mercury and thallium&mdash;are known, so also for
silicon we have <i>lead</i> as the heaviest analogue (Pb = 206), with a series
of both kindred and special properties. The higher type, PbX<sub>4</sub>&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
instance, PbO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;is in a chemical sense far less stable than the lower
type, PbX. The ordinary compounds of lead correspond with the
latter, and in addition to this, PbO, although not particularly energetic,
is still a decided base easily forming basic salts, PbX<sub>2</sub>(PbO)<sub>n</sub>.
Although the compounds PbX<sub>4</sub>, are unstable they offer many points of
analogy with the corresponding compounds of tin SnO<sub>2</sub>; this is seen,
for instance, in the fact that PbO<sub>2</sub> is a feeble acid, giving the salt
PbK<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, that PbCl<sub>4</sub> is a liquid like SnCl<sub>4</sub> which is not affected by
sulphuric acid, and that PbF<sub>4</sub> gives double salts, like SnF<sub>4</sub> or SiF<sub>4</sub>
(Brauner 1894. See Chapter II., Note 49 bis); Pb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> also
resembles Sn(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> &amp;c. All this shows that lead is a true analogue
of tin, as Hg is of cadmium.<a name="FNanchor_41_BIS_172" id="FNanchor_41_BIS_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_BIS_172" class="fnanchor">[41 bis]</a></p>

<p><i>Lead</i> is found in nature in considerable masses, in the form of
galena, <i>lead sulphide</i>, PbS.<a name="FNanchor_42_173" id="FNanchor_42_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_173" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The specific gravity of galena is 7·58,
colour grey; it crystallises in the regular system, and has a fine
metallic lustre. Both the native and artificial sulphides are insoluble
in acids (hydrogen sulphide gives a black precipitate with the salts
PbX<sub>2</sub>).<a name="FNanchor_42_BIS_174" id="FNanchor_42_BIS_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_BIS_174" class="fnanchor">[42 bis]</a> When heated, lead melts, and in the open air is either totally
or partially transformed into white lead sulphate, PbSO<sub>4</sub>, as it also is
by many oxidising agents (hydrogen peroxide, potassium nitrate).
Lead sulphate is also insoluble in water,<a name="FNanchor_43_175" id="FNanchor_43_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_175" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and lead is but rarely met
with in this form in nature. The chromates, vanadates, phosphates, and
similar salts of lead are also somewhat rare. The carbonate, PbCO<sub>2</sub>, is
sometimes found in large masses, especially in the Altai region. Lead
sulphide is often worked for extracting the silver which it contains;
and as the lead itself also finds manifold industrial applications, this
work is carried out on an exceedingly large scale. Many methods are
employed. Sometimes the lead sulphide is decomposed by heating it
with cast iron. The iron takes up the sulphur from the lead and forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
easily-fusible iron sulphide, which does not mix with the heavier reduced
lead. But another process is more frequently used: the lead ore (it must
be clean; that is, free from earthy matter, which may be easily removed
by washing) is heated in a reverberatory furnace to a moderate temperature
with a free access of air. During this operation part of the lead
sulphide oxidises and forms lead sulphate, PbSO<sub>4</sub>, and lead oxide.
When the oxidation of part of the lead has been attained, it is necessary
to shut off the air supply and increase the temperature, then the
oxidised compounds of the lead enter into reaction with the remaining
lead sulphide, with formation of sulphurous anhydride and metallic lead.
At first from PbS + O<sub>3</sub>, PbO + SO<sub>2</sub> are formed, and also from PbS + O<sub>4</sub>
lead sulphate PbSO<sub>4</sub>, and then PbO and PbSO<sub>4</sub> react with the remaining
PbS, according to the equations 2PbO + PbS = 3Pb + SO<sub>2</sub> and
also PbSO<sub>4</sub> + PbS = 2Pb + 2SO<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_44_176" id="FNanchor_44_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_176" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The appearance of lead is well known; its specific gravity is 11·3;
the bluish colour and well-marked metallic lustre of freshly-cut lead
quickly disappear when exposed to the air, because it becomes coated
with a layer&mdash;although a very thin layer&mdash;of oxide and salts formed
by the moisture and acids in the atmosphere. It melts at 320°, and
crystallises in octahedra on cooling. Its softness is apparent from
the flexibility of lead pipes and sheets, and also from the fact that it
may be cut with a knife, and also that it leaves a grey streak when
rubbed on paper. On account of its being so soft, lead naturally
cannot be applied in many cases where most metals may be used; but
on the other hand it is a metal which is not easily changed by
chemical reagents, and as it is capable of being soldered and drawn
into sheets, &amp;c., lead is most valuable for many technical uses. Lead
pipes are used for conveying water<a name="FNanchor_45_177" id="FNanchor_45_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_177" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and many other liquids, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sheet lead is used for lining all kinds of vessels containing liquids&mdash;(acids,
for instance) which act on other metals. This particularly refers
to sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, because at a low temperature they
do not act on lead, and if they form lead sulphate, PbSO<sub>4</sub>, and chloride,
PbCl<sub>2</sub>, these salts being insoluble in water and in acids, cover the
lead and protect it from further corrosion.<a name="FNanchor_46_178" id="FNanchor_46_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_178" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> All soluble preparations
of lead are poisonous. At a white heat lead may be partially distilled;
the vapours oxidise and burn. Lead may also be easily oxidised at
low temperatures. Lead only decomposes water at a white heat,
and does not liberate hydrogen from acids, with the exception only
of very strong hydrochloric acid and then only when boiling.
Sulphuric acid diluted with water does not act on it, or only acts
very feebly at the surface; but strong sulphuric acid, when heated,
is decomposed by it, with the evolution of sulphurous anhydride. The
best solvent for lead is nitric acid, which transforms it into a soluble
salt, Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Although acids thus have directly but little effect on lead, and
this is one of its most important practical properties, <i>yet when air
has free access, lead (like copper) very easily reacts with many acids</i>, even
with those which are comparatively feeble. The action of acetic acid
on lead is particularly striking and often applied in practice. If lead
be plunged into acetic acid it does not change at all and does not pass
into solution, but if part of the lead be immersed in the acid, and
the other part remain in contact with the air, or if lead be merely
covered with a thin layer of acetic acid in such a way that the air
is practically in contact with the metal, then it unites with the oxygen
of the air to form oxide, which combines with the acetic acid and
forms lead acetate, soluble in water. The formation of lead oxide is
especially marked from the fact that with a sufficient quantity of air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
not only is the normal lead acetate formed but also the basic
salts.<a name="FNanchor_47_179" id="FNanchor_47_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_179" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>When oxidising in the presence of air,<a name="FNanchor_48_180" id="FNanchor_48_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_180" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> when heated or in the
presence of an acid at the ordinary temperature, lead forms compounds
of the type PbX<sub>2</sub>. <i>Lead oxide</i>, PbO, known in industry as <i>litharge</i>,
silberglätte (this name is due to the fact that silver is extracted from the
lead ores of this kind) and massicot. If the lead is oxidised in air at a
high temperature, the oxide which is formed fuses, and on cooling is
easily obtained in fused masses which split up into scales of a yellowish
colour, having a specific gravity of 9·3; in this form it bears the name
of litharge. Litharge is principally used for making lead salts, for
the extraction of metallic lead, and also for the preparation of
drying oils&mdash;for instance, from linseed oil.<a name="FNanchor_49_181" id="FNanchor_49_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_181" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> When oxidised carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and slightly heated, lead forms a powdery (not fused) oxide
known under the name of <i>massicot</i>. It is best prepared in the
laboratory by heating lead nitrate, or lead hydroxide. It has a
yellow colour, and differs from litharge in the greater difficulty with
which it forms lead salts with acids. Thus, for instance, when
massicot is moistened with water it does not attract the carbonic acid
of the air so easily as litharge does. It may, however, be imagined
that the cause of the difference depends only on the formation of
dioxide on the surface of the lead oxide, on which the acids do not
act. In any case lead oxide is comparatively easily soluble in nitric
and acetic acids. It is but slightly soluble in water, but communicates
an alkaline reaction to it, since it forms the hydroxide.
This hydroxide is obtained in the shape of a white precipitate by the
action of a small quantity of an alkali hydroxide on a solution of a
lead salt. An excess of alkali dissolves the hydroxide separated, which
fact demonstrates the comparatively indistinct basic properties of lead
oxide. The normal lead hydroxide, which should have the composition
Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub>, is unknown in a separate state, but it is known in combination
with lead oxide as Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub>,2PbO or Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The latter
is obtained in the form of brilliant, white, octahedral crystals when
basic lead acetate is mixed with ammonia and gently heated. The
basic qualities of this hydroxide are shown distinctly by its absorbing
the carbonic anhydride of the air. When an alkaline solution of the
hydroxide is boiled, it deposits lead oxide in the form of a crystalline
powder.</p>

<p>Lead oxide forms but few soluble salts&mdash;for instance, the nitrate
and the acetate. The majority of its salts (sulphate, PbSO<sub>4</sub>; carbonate,
PbCO<sub>3</sub>; iodide, PbI<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.) are insoluble in water. These salts are
colourless or light yellow if the acid be colourless. In lead oxide <i>the
faculty of forming basic salts</i>, PbX<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>PbO or PbX<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>PbH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is strongly
developed. A similar property was observed in magnesium and also
in the salts of mercury, but lead oxide forms basic salts with still
greater facility, although double salts are in this case more rarely
formed.<a name="FNanchor_50_182" id="FNanchor_50_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_182" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the soluble lead salts, that best known and most often
applied in practical chemistry is <i>lead nitrate</i>, obtained directly by
dissolving lead or its oxide in nitric acid. The normal salt, Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
crystallises in octahedra, dissolves in water, and has a specific gravity
of 4·5. When a solution of this salt acts on white lead or is boiled
with litharge, the basic salt, having a composition Pb(OH)(NO<sub>3</sub>), is
formed in crystalline needles, sparingly soluble in cold water but easily
dissolved in hot water, and therefore in many respects resembling lead
chloride. When the nitrate is heated, either lead oxide is obtained or
else the oxide in combination with peroxide.</p>

<p><i>Lead chloride</i>, PbCl<sub>2</sub>, is precipitated from the soluble salts of lead
when a strong solution is treated with hydrochloric acid or a metallic
chloride. It is soluble in considerable quantities in hot water, and
therefore if the solutions be dilute or hot, the precipitation of lead
chloride does not occur, and if a hot solution be cooled, the salt
separates in brilliant prismatic crystals. It fuses when heated (like
silver chloride), but is insoluble in ammonia. This salt is sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
met with in nature, and when heated in air is capable of exchanging
half its chlorine for oxygen, forming the basic salt or lead oxychloride,
PbCl<sub>2</sub>PbO, which may also be obtained by fusing PbCl<sub>2</sub> and PbO together.
The reaction of lead chloride with water vapour leads to the same
conclusion, showing the feeble basic character of lead 2PbCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
= PbCl<sub>2</sub>,PbO + 2HCl. When ammonia is added to an aqueous solution
of lead chloride a white precipitate is formed, which parts with water
on being heated, and has the composition Pb(OH)Cl,PbO. This compound
is also formed by the action of metallic chlorides on other soluble
basic salts of lead.<a name="FNanchor_51_183" id="FNanchor_51_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_183" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Lead carbonate, or <i>white lead</i>, is the most extensively used basic
lead salt. It has the valuable property of &lsquo;covering,&rsquo; which only to a
certain extent appertains to lead sulphate and other white powdery
substances used as pigments. This faculty of &lsquo;covering&rsquo; consists in
the fact that a small quantity of white lead mixed with oil spreads
uniformly, and if such a mixture be spread over a surface (for instance,
of wood or metal) the surface is quickly covered&mdash;that is, light does not
penetrate through even a very thin layer of superposed white lead; thus,
for example, the grain of the wood remains invisible.<a name="FNanchor_52_184" id="FNanchor_52_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_184" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> White lead,
or <i>basic lead carbonate</i>, after being dried at 120°, has a composition
Pb(OH)<sub>2</sub>,2PbCO<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_53_185" id="FNanchor_53_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_185" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It may be obtained by adding a solution of sodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
carbonate to a solution of one of the basic salts of lead&mdash;for instance,
the basic acetate&mdash;and likewise by treating this latter with carbonic
acid. For this purpose the solution of basic acetate is poured into the
vessel <i>f</i>; it is prepared in the vat A, containing litharge, into which
the pump P delivers the solution of the acetate, which remains after
the action of carbonic anhydride on the basic salt. In A a basic salt is
formed having a composition approaching to Pb<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; carbonic
anhydride, 2CO<sub>2</sub>, is passed through this solution and precipitates
white lead, Pb<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and normal lead acetate, Pb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, remains
in the solution, and is pumped back into the vat A containing
lead oxide, where the normal salt is again (on being agitated) converted
into the basic salt. This is run into the vessel E, and thence into <i>f</i>.
Into the latter carbonic anhydride is delivered from the generator D,
and forms a precipitate of white lead.<a name="FNanchor_53_BIS_186" id="FNanchor_53_BIS_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_BIS_186" class="fnanchor">[53 bis]</a></p>

<p>In order to mark the transition from lead oxide, PbO, into lead
dioxide PbO<sub>2</sub> (plumbic anhydride), it is necessary to direct our
attention to the intermediate oxide, or <i>red lead</i>, Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_54_187" id="FNanchor_54_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_187" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In the arts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
it is used in considerable quantities, because it forms a very durable
yellowish-red paint used for colouring the resins (shellac, colophony,
&amp;c.) composing sealing wax. It also forms a very good cheap oil
paint, used especially for painting metals, more particularly because
drying oils&mdash;for instance, hemp seed, linseed oils&mdash;very quickly dry
with red lead and with lead salts. Red lead is prepared by slightly
heating massicot, for which purpose two-storied stoves are used. In
the lower story the lead is turned into massicot, and in the higher
one, having the lower temperature (about 300°), the massicot is transformed
into red lead. Frémy and others showed the instability of red
lead prepared by various methods, and its decomposition by acids, with
formation of lead dioxide, which is insoluble in acids, and a solution
of the salts of lead oxide. The artificial production (synthesis) of red
lead by double decomposition was most important. For this purpose
Frémy mixed an alkaline solution of potassium plumbate, K<sub>2</sub>PbO<sub>3</sub> (prepared
by dissolving the dioxide in fused potash),<a name="FNanchor_54_BIS_188" id="FNanchor_54_BIS_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_BIS_188" class="fnanchor">[54 bis]</a> with an alkaline
solution of lead oxide. In this way a yellow precipitate of minium
hydrate is formed, which, when slightly heated, loses water and turns
into bright red anhydrous minium Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>Minium is the first and most ordinary means of producing <i>lead
dioxide</i>, or plumbic anhydride, PbO<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_55_189" id="FNanchor_55_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_189" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> because when red lead is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
treated with dilute nitric acid it gives up lead oxide, and PbO<sub>2</sub> remains,
on which dilute nitric acid does not act. The composition of minium
is Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and therefore the action of nitric acid on it is expressed by
the equation: Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 4HNO<sub>3</sub> = PbO<sub>2</sub> + 2Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. The
dioxide may also be obtained by treating lead hydroxide suspended in
water with a stream of chlorine. Under these conditions the chlorine
takes up the hydrogen from the water, and the oxygen passes over to the
lead oxide.<a name="FNanchor_56_190" id="FNanchor_56_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_190" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> When a strong solution of lead nitrate is decomposed by
the electric current, the appearance of crystalline lead dioxide is also
observed upon the positive pole; it is also found in nature in the form
of a black crystalline substance having a specific gravity of 9·4. When
artificially produced it is a fine dark powder, resisting the action of
acids, but nevertheless when treated with strong sulphuric acid it
evolves oxygen and forms lead sulphate, and with hydrochloric acid it
evolves chlorine. The oxidising property of lead dioxide depends
of course on the facility of its transition into the more stable lead
oxide, which is easily understood from the whole history of lead compounds.
In the presence of alkalis it transforms chromium oxide into
chromic acid, whilst lead chromate, PbCrO<sub>4</sub>, is formed, remaining, however,
in solution, on account of its being soluble in caustic alkalis. The
oxidising action of lead dioxide on sulphurous anhydride is most striking,
as it immediately absorbs it, with formation of lead sulphate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
This is accompanied by a change of colour and development of heat,
PbO<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> = PbSO<sub>4</sub>. When triturated with sulphur the mixture
explodes, the sulphur burning at the expense of the oxygen of the lead
dioxide. <i>Tetrachloride of lead</i>, PbCl<sub>4</sub>, belongs to the same class of
lead compounds as PbO<sub>2</sub>. This chloride is formed by the action of
strong hydrochloric acid upon PbO<sub>2</sub>, or, in the cold, by passing a stream
of chlorine through water containing PbCl<sub>2</sub> in suspension. The resultant
yellow solution gives off chlorine when heated. With a solution
of sal ammoniac (Nicolukin, 1885) it gives a precipitate of a double
salt, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbCl<sub>6</sub> (very slightly soluble in a solution of sal ammoniac),
which when treated with strong sulphuric acid (Friedrich, 1890) gives
PbCl<sub>4</sub> as a yellow liquid sp. gr. 3·18, which solidifies at -18°, and when
heated gives PbCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>. It is not acted upon by H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> like SnCl<sub>4</sub>.
Tetrafluoride of lead (Brauner) belongs to the same class of compounds,
it easily forms double salts and decomposes with the evolution of
fluorine (Chapter II., Note 49 bis).<a name="FNanchor_56_BIS_191" id="FNanchor_56_BIS_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_BIS_191" class="fnanchor">[56 bis]</a></p>

<p>Amongst the elements of the second and third groups it was
observed that the elements were more basic in the even than in the
uneven series. It is sufficient to remember calcium, strontium, and
barium in the even, and magnesium, zinc, and cadmium in the uneven
series. In addition to this, in the even series, as the atomic weight
increases, in the same type of oxidation the basic properties increase
(the acid properties decrease); for example, in the second group, calcium,
strontium, barium. The same also appears in the fourth and all the
following groups. In the even series of the fourth group titanium,
zirconium, cerium, and thorium are found. All their highest oxides,
RO<sub>2</sub>, even the lightest, titanic oxide, TiO<sub>2</sub>, have more highly developed
basic properties than silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and in addition to this the basic
properties are more distinctly seen in zirconium dioxide, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, than
in titanic oxide, TiO<sub>2</sub>, although the acid property of combining with
bases still remains. In the heaviest oxides, cerium dioxide, CeO<sub>2</sub>, and
thorium dioxide, ThO<sub>2</sub>, no acid properties are observed, these being
both purely basic oxides. In Chapter XVII. (Note <a href="#Footnote_43_120">43</a>) we already
pointed out this higher oxide of cerium. As the above-mentioned
elements are rather rare in nature, have but little practical application,
and do not present any new forms of combination, it is unadvisable
to dwell on them in this treatise.</p>

<p><i>Titanium</i> is found in nature in the form of its anhydride or oxide,
TiO<sub>2</sub>, mixed with silicon in many minerals, but the oxide is also found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
separately in the form of semi-metallic <i>rutile</i> (sp. gr. 4·2). Another
titanic mineral is found as a mixture in other ores, known as <i>titanic
iron ore</i> (in the Thuensky mountains of the southern Ural; it is known
as <i>thuenite</i>), FeTiO<sub>3</sub>. This is a salt of ferrous oxide and titanic anhydride.
It crystallises in the rhombohedric system, has a metallic
lustre, grey colour, sp. gr. 4·5. The third mineral in which titanium is
found in considerable quantities in nature is <i>sphene</i> or <i>titanite</i>, CaTiSiO<sub>5</sub>
= CaO,SiO<sub>2</sub>,TiO<sub>2</sub>, sp. gr. 3·5, colour yellow, green, or the like, crystallises
in tablets. The fourth, but rare, titanic mineral is <i>peroffskite</i>,
calcium titanate, CaTiO<sub>3</sub>; it forms blackish-grey or brown cubic
crystals, sp. gr. 4·02, and occurs in the Ural and other localities. It
may be prepared artificially by fusing sphene in an atmosphere of water
vapour and carbonic anhydride. At the end of the last century Klaproth
showed the distinction between titanic compounds and all others
then known.<a name="FNanchor_57_192" id="FNanchor_57_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_192" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>The comparatively rare element <i>zirconium</i>, Zr = 90, is very similar
to titanium, but has a more basic character. It is rarer in nature
than titanium, and is found principally in a mineral called <i>zircon</i>,
ZrSiO<sub>4</sub> = ZrO<sub>2</sub>.SiO<sub>2</sub>, crystallising in square prisms, sp. gr. 4·5. It has
considerable hardness and a characteristic brownish-yellow colour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
is occasionally found in the form of transparent crystals, as a precious
stone called hyacinth.<a name="FNanchor_58_193" id="FNanchor_58_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_193" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Metallic zirconium was obtained, by Berzelius
and Troost, by the action of aluminium on potassium zirconofluoride in
the same way that silicon is prepared; it forms a crystalline powder,
similar in appearance to graphite and antimony, but having a very considerable
hardness, not much lustre, sp. gr. 4·15. In many respects it
resembles silicon; it does not fuse when heated, and even oxidises with
difficulty, but liberates hydrogen when fused with potash. When fused
with silica it liberates silicon. With carbon in the electrical furnace it
forms ZrC<sub>2</sub>, with hydrogen it gives ZrH<sub>2</sub> (like CaH<sub>2</sub>, Winkler, Vol. I.,
p. 621); hydrochloric and nitric acids act feebly on it, but aqua regia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
easily dissolves it. It is distinguished from silicon by the fact that
hydrofluoric acid acts on it with great facility, even in the cold and
when diluted, whilst this acid does not act on silicon at all.</p>

<p>The very similar element <i>thorium</i> (Th = 232) was distinguished by
Berzelius from zirconium. It is very rarely met with, in <i>thorite</i> and
<i>orangeite</i>, ThSiO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. The latter is isomorphous with zircon (sp. gr.
4·8).<a name="FNanchor_59_194" id="FNanchor_59_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_194" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

for intercombination, or polymerisation, is also seen in the unsaturated hydrocarbons
and carbon compounds in general. In silicon a property of the same nature is found to
be particularly developed in silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, which is not the case with carbonic anhydride.
The faculty of the molecules of silica for combining both with other molecules and
among themselves is exhibited in the formation of most varied compounds with bases,
in the formation of hydrates with a gradually decreasing proportion of water down to
anhydrous silica, in the colloid nature of the hydrate (the molecules of colloids are always
complex), in the formation of polymeric ethereal salts, and in many other properties
which will be considered in the sequel. Having come to this conclusion as to the polymeric
state of silica since the years 1850&ndash;1860, I have found it to be confirmed by all
subsequent researches on the compounds of silica, and, if I mistake not, this view has
now been very generally accepted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_124" id="Footnote_3_124"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_124"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It was only after Gerhardt, and in general subsequently to the establishment of
the true atomic weights of the elements (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_299">VII.</a>), that a true idea of the atomic
weight of silicon and of the composition of silica was arrived at from the fact that the
molecules of SiCl<sub>4</sub>, SiF<sub>4</sub>, Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c., never contain less than 28 parts of silicon.</p>

<p>The question <i>of the composition of silica</i> was long the subject of the most contradictory
statements in the history of science. In the last century Pott, Bergmann, and
Scheele distinguished silica from alumina and lime. In the beginning of the present
century Smithson for the first time expressed the opinion that silica was an acid, and
the minerals of rocks salts of this acid. Berzelius determined the presence of oxygen in
silica&mdash;namely, that 8 parts of oxygen were united with 7 of silicon. The composition of
silica was first expressed as SiO (and for the sake of shortness S only was sometimes
written instead). An investigation in the amount of silica present in crystalline minerals
showed that the amount of oxygen in the bases bears a very varied proportion to the
amount of oxygen in the silica, and that this ratio varies from 2 : 1 to 1 : 3. The
ratio 1 : 1 is also met with, but the majority of these minerals are rare. Other more
common minerals contain a larger proportion of silica, the ratio between the oxygen of
the bases and the oxygen of the silica being equal to 1 : 2, or thereabouts; such are the
augites, labradorites, oligoclase, talc, &amp;c. The higher ratio 1 : 3 is known for a widely
distributed series of natural silicates&mdash;for example, the felspars. Those silicates in which
the amount of oxygen in the bases is equal to that in the silica are termed <i>monosilicates</i>;
their general formula will be (RO)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2</sub> or (R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. Those in which the ratio of
the oxygen is equal to 1 : 2 are termed <i>bisilicates</i>, and their general formula will be
ROSiO<sub>2</sub> or R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>. Those in which the ratio is 1 : 3 will be <i>trisilicates</i>, and their
general formula (RO)<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub> or (R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>9</sub>.</p>

<p>In these formulæ the now established composition of SiO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that is, that in which the
atom of Si = 28&mdash;is employed. Berzelius, who made an accurate analysis of the composition
of felspar, and recognised it as a trisilicate formed by the union of potassium oxide and
alumina with silica, in just the same manner as the alums are formed by sulphuric acid,
gave silica the same formula as sulphuric anhydride&mdash;that is, SiO<sub>3</sub>. In this case the
formula of felspar would be exactly similar to that of the alums&mdash;that is, KAl(SiO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
like the alums, KAl(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. If the composition of silica be represented as SiO<sub>3</sub>, the atom
of silicon must be recognised as equal to 42 (if O = 16; or if O = 8, as it was before taken
to be, Si = 21).</p>

<p>The former formulæ of silica, SiO (Si = 14) and SiO<sub>3</sub> (Si = 42), were first changed into
the present one, SiO<sub>2</sub> (Si = 28), on the basis of the following arguments:&mdash;An excess of
silica occurs in nature, and in siliceous rocks free silica is generally found side by side with
the silicates, and one is therefore led to the conclusion that it has formed acid salts.
It would therefore be incorrect to consider the trisilicates as normal salts of silica, for
they contain the largest proportion of silica; it is much better to admit another formula
with a smaller proportion of oxygen for silica, and it then appears that the majority of
minerals are normal or slightly basic salts, whilst some of the minerals predominating
in nature contain an excess of silica&mdash;that is, belong to the order of acid salts.</p>

<p>At the present time, when there is a general method (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_299">VII.</a>) for the determination
of atomic weights, the volumes of the volatile compounds of silica show that its atomic
weight Si = 28, and therefore silica is SiO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, for example, the vapour density of
silicon chloride with respect to air is, as Dumas showed (1862), 5·94, and hence with respect
to hydrogen it is 85·5, and consequently its molecular weight will be 171 (instead of 170
as indicated by theory). This weight contains 28 parts of silicon and 142 parts of
chlorine, and as an atom of the latter is equal to 35·5, the molecule of silicon chloride contains
SiCl<sub>4</sub>. As two atoms of chlorine are equivalent to one of oxygen, the composition
of silica will be SiO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that is, the same as stannic oxide, SnO<sub>2</sub>, or titanic oxide, TiO<sub>2</sub>, and
the like, and also as carbonic and sulphurous anhydrides, CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>. But silica bears
but little physical resemblance to the latter compounds, whilst stannic and titanic
oxides resemble silica both physically and chemically. They are non-volatile, crystalline
insoluble, are colloids, also form feeble acids like silica, &amp;c., and they might therefore be
expected to form analogous compounds, and be isomorphous with silica, as Marignac
(1859) found actually to be the case. He obtained stannofluorides, for example an easily
soluble strontium salt, SrSnF<sub>6</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, corresponding with the already long known silicofluorides,
such as SrSiF<sub>6</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. These two salts are almost identical in crystalline
form (monoclinic; angle of the prism, 83° for the former and 84° for the latter; inclination
of the axes, 103° 46&#8242; for the latter and 103° 30&#8242; for the former), that is, they are
isomorphous. We may here add that the specific volume of silica in a solid form is 22·6,
and of stannic oxide 21·5.</p></div>

of Si and Mg is also formed (Gattermann). Warren (1888) by heating magnesium in a
stream of SiF<sub>4</sub> obtained silicon and its alloy with magnesium. Winkler (1890) found
that Mg<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>3</sub> and Mg<sub>2</sub>Si are formed when SiO<sub>2</sub> and Mg are heated together at lower temperatures,
whilst at a high temperature Si only is formed.</p></div>

forming a white mass which, after being treated with potassium hydroxide and hydrofluoric
acid, leaves a very stable yellow substance of the formula SiCO, which is formed according
to the equation, 3Si + 2CO<sub>2</sub> = SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2SiCO. It is also slowly formed when silicon is heated
with carbonic oxide. It is not oxidised when heated in oxygen. A mixture of silicon and
carbon when heated in nitrogen gives the compound Si<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>N, which is also very stable.
On this basis Schützenberger recognises a group, C<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, as capable of combining with O<sub>2</sub>
and N, like C.</p>

<p>We may add that Troost and Hautefeuille, by heating amorphous silicon in the
vapour of SiCl<sub>4</sub>, obtained crystalline silicon, and probably at the same time lower compounds
of Si and Cl were temporarily formed. In the vapour of TiCl<sub>4</sub> under the same
conditions crystalline titanium is formed (Levy, 1892).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_127" id="Footnote_5_127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_127"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> This alloy, as Beketoff and Cherikoff showed, is easily obtained by directly heating
finely divided silica (the experiment may be conducted in a test tube) with magnesium
powder (Chapter XIV., Notes <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_17_844">17</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_18_845">18</a>). The substance formed, when thrown into a solution
of hydrochloric acid, evolves spontaneously inflammable and impure silicon hydride,
so that the self-inflammability of the gas is easily demonstrated by this means.</p>

<p>In 1850&ndash;60 Wöhler and Buff obtained an alloy of silicon and magnesium by the
action of sodium on a molten mixture of magnesium chloride, sodium silicofluoride,
and sodium chloride. The sodium then simultaneously reduces the silicon and
magnesium.</p>

<p>Friedel and Ladenburg subsequently prepared silicon hydride in a pure state, and
showed that it is not spontaneously inflammable in air, at the ordinary pressure, but that,
like PH<sub>3</sub>, and like the mixture prepared by the above methods, it easily takes fire in
air under a lower pressure or when mixed with hydrogen. They prepared the pure
compound in the following manner: Wöhler showed that when dry hydrochloric acid
gas is passed through a slightly heated tube containing silicon it forms a very volatile
colourless liquid, which fumes strongly in air; this is a mixture of silicon chloride, SiCl<sub>4</sub>,
and <i>silicon chloroform</i>, SiHCl<sub>3</sub>, which corresponds with ordinary chloroform, CHCl<sub>3</sub>.
This mixture is easily separated by distillation, because silicon chloride boils at 57°, and
silicon chloroform at 36°. The formation of the latter will be understood from the
equation Si + 3HCl = H<sub>2</sub> + SiHCl<sub>3</sub>. It is an anhydrous inflammable liquid of specific
gravity 1·6. It forms a transition product between SiH<sub>4</sub> and SiCl<sub>4</sub>, and may be obtained
from silicon hydride by the action of chlorine and SbCl<sub>5</sub>, and is itself also transformed
into silicon chloride by the action of chlorine. Gattermann obtained SiHCl<sub>3</sub> by heating
the mass obtained after the action (Note <a href="#Footnote_4_125">4</a>) of Mg upon SiO<sub>2</sub>, in a stream of chlorine
(with HCl) at about 470°. Friedel and Ladenburg, by acting on anhydrous alcohol with
silicon chloroform, obtained an ethereal compound having the composition SiH(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.
This ether boils at 136°, and when acted on by sodium disengages silicon hydride, and
is converted into ethyl orthosilicate, Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, according to the equation 4SiH(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>
= SiH<sub>4</sub> + 3Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub> (the sodium seems to be unchanged), which is exactly similar
to the decomposition of the lower oxides of phosphorus, with the evolution of phosphuretted
hydrogen. If we designate the group C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, contained in the silicon ethers by
Et, the parallel is found to be exact:</p>

<p class="title">4PHO(OH)<sub>2</sub> = PH<sub>3</sub> + 3PO(OH)<sub>3</sub>; 4SiH(OEt)<sub>3</sub> = SiH<sub>4</sub> + 3Si(OEt)<sub>4</sub>.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_128" id="Footnote_6_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_128"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The amorphous silica is mixed with starch, dried, and then charred by heating the
mixture in a closed crucible. A very intimate mixture of silica and charcoal is thus
formed. In Chapter XI., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_13_523">13</a>, we saw that elements like silicon disengage more
heat with oxygen than with chlorine, and therefore their oxygen compounds cannot be
directly decomposed by chlorine, but that this can be effected when the affinity of carbon
for oxygen is utilised to aid the action. When the mass obtained by the action of Mg
upon SiO<sub>2</sub> is heated to 300° in a current of chlorine, it easily forms SiCl<sub>4</sub> (Gattermann):
besides which two other compounds, corresponding to SiCl<sub>4</sub>, are formed, namely:
Si<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, which boils at 145° and solidifies at -1°, and Si<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>, which boils at about 212°.
These substances, which answer to corresponding carbon compounds (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>),
act upon water and form corresponding oxygen compounds; for instance, Si<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O
= (SiO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub> + 6HCl gives the analogue of oxalic acid (CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>. This substance is insoluble
in water, decomposes under the action of friction and heat with an explosion, and should
be called <i>silico-oxalic acid</i>, Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (<i>see</i> later, Note <a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_135">11</a><sup>bis</sup>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_129" id="Footnote_7_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_129"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Silicon chloride shows a similar behaviour with alcohol. This is accompanied by a
very characteristic phenomenon; on pouring silicon chloride into anhydrous alcohol a
momentary evolution of heat is observed, owing to a reaction of double decomposition,
but this is immediately followed by a powerful cooling effect, due to the disengagement
of a large amount of hydrochloric acid&mdash;that is, there is an absorption of heat from the
formation of gaseous hydrochloric acid. This is a very instructive example in this
respect; here two processes occurring simultaneously&mdash;one chemical and the other
physical&mdash;are divided from each other by time, the latter process showing itself by a
distinct fall in temperature. In the majority of cases the two processes proceed simultaneously,
and we only observe the difference between the heat developed and absorbed. In
acting on alcohol, silicon chloride forms ethyl orthosilicate, SiCl<sub>4</sub> + 4HOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> = 4HCl
+ Si(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. This substance boils at 160°, and has a specific gravity 0·94. Another salt,
ethyl metasilicate, SiO(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is also formed by the action of silicon chloride on anhydrous
alcohol; it volatilises above 300°, having a sp. gr. 1·08. It is exceedingly interesting
that these two ethereal salts are both volatile, and both correspond with silica,
SiO<sub>2</sub>: the first ether corresponds to the hydrate Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, orthosilic acid, and the
second to the hydrate SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, metasilicic acid. As the nature of hydrates may
be judged from the composition of salts, so also, with equal right, can ethereal salts
serve the same purpose. The composition of an ethereal salt corresponds with that
of an acid in which the hydrogen is replaced by a hydrocarbon radicle&mdash;for instance, by
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>. And, therefore, it may be truly said that there exist at least the two silicic acids
above mentioned. We shall afterwards see that there are really several such hydrates;
that these ethereal salts actually correspond with hydrates of silica is clearly shown
from the fact that they are decomposed by water, and that in moist air they give
alcohol and the corresponding hydrate, although the hydrate which is obtained in the
residue always corresponds with the second ethereal salt only&mdash;that is, it has the
composition SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>; this form corresponds also to carbonic acid in its ordinary salts.
This hydrate is formed as a vitreous mass when the ethyl silicates are exposed to air,
owing to the action of the atmospheric moisture on them. Its specific gravity is 1·77.</p>

<p><i>Silicon bromide</i>, SiBr<sub>4</sub>, as well as silicon bromoform, SiHBr<sub>3</sub>, are substances closely
resembling the chlorine compounds in their reactions, and they are obtained in the same
manner. Silicon iodoform, SiHI<sub>3</sub>, boils at about 220°, has a specific gravity of 3·4,
reacts in the same manner as silicon chloroform, and is formed, together with silicon iodide,
SiI<sub>4</sub>, by the action of a mixture of hydrogen and hydriodic acid on heated silicon. Silicon
iodide is a solid at the ordinary temperature, fusing at about 120°; it may be distilled in
a stream of carbonic anhydride, but easily takes fire in air, and behaves with water and
other reagents just like silicon chloride. It may be obtained by the direct action of the
vapour of iodine on heated silicon. Besson (1891) also obtained SiCl<sub>3</sub>I (boils at 113°),
SiCl<sub>2</sub>I<sub>2</sub> (172°), and SiClI<sub>3</sub> (220°), and the corresponding bromine compounds. All the
halogen compounds of Si are capable of absorbing 6NH<sub>3</sub> and more. Besides which
Besson obtained SiSCl<sub>2</sub> by heating Si in the vapour of chloride of sulphur; this
compound melts at 74°, boils at 185°, and gives with water the hydrate of SiO<sub>2</sub>, HCl,
and H<sub>2</sub>S.</p></div>

the aqueous solution of silicon fluoride does not yield a hydrate of silica, but a fluo-hydrate
(Schiff), Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(OH)F, corresponding to the (pyro) hydrate Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, equal to
SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2</sub>, so that the reaction of silicon fluoride on water is expressed by the equation:
5SiF<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = 3SiH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> + Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(OH)F + HF. However, Berzelius states that the
hydrate, when well washed with water, contains no fluorine, which is probably due to the
fact that an excess of water decomposes Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(OH)F, forming hydrofluoric acid and the
compound Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. Water saturated with silicon fluoride disengages silicon fluoride
and hydrofluoric acid when treated with hydrochloric acid, the gelatinous precipitate being
simultaneously dissolved. It may be further remarked that hydrofluosilicic acid has been
frequently regarded as SiO<sub>2</sub>,6HF, because it is formed by the solution of silica in hydrofluoric
acid, but only two of these six hydrogens are replaced by metals. On concentration,
solutions of the acid begin to decompose when they reach a strength of 6H<sub>2</sub>O
per H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>, and therefore the acid may be regarded as Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O,6HF, but the corresponding
salts contain less water, and there are even anhydrous salts, R<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>, so that
the acid itself is most simply represented as H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>If gaseous silicon fluoride be passed directly into water, the gas-conducting tube becomes
clogged with the precipitated silicic acid. This is best prevented by immersing the
end of the tube under mercury, and then pouring water over the mercury; the silicon
fluoride then passes through the mercury, and only comes into contact with the water at
its surface, and consequently the gas-conducting tube remains unobstructed. The silicic
acid thus obtained soon settles, and a colourless solution with a pleasant but distinctly
acid taste is procured.</p>

<p>Mackintosh, by taking 9 p.c. of hydrofluoric acid, observed that in the course of an
hour its action on opal attained 77 p.c. of the possible, and did not exceed 1&frac12; p.c. of its
possible action on quartz during the same time. This shows the difference of the
structure of these two modifications of silica, which will be more fully described in the
sequel.</p></div>

salts of hydrofluosilicic acid may be obtained not only by the action of the acid on bases
or by double decompositions, but also by the action of hydrofluoric acid on metallic
silicates. Sulphuric acid decomposes them, with evolution of hydrofluoric acid and
silicon fluoride, and the salts when heated evolve silicon fluoride, leaving a residue of

hydrates which are known for silicon. If we suppose water to be taken up from the first
hydrates (just as formic acid is CH(OH)<sub>3</sub>, <i>minus</i> water), we shall obtain the various
lower hydrates corresponding with silicon hydride. When ignited they should, like
phosphorous and hypophosphorous acids, disengage silicon hydride, and leave a residue
of silica behind&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of the oxide corresponding to the highest hydrate&mdash;just as organic
hydrates (for example, formic acid with an alkali) form carbonic anhydride as the highest
oxygen compound. Such imperfect hydrates of silicon, or, more correctly speaking, of
silicon hydride, were first obtained by Wöhler (1863) and studied by Geuther (1865), and
were named after their characteristic colours. (<i>See</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_6_128">6</a>6).</p>

<p><i>Leucone</i> is a white hydrate of the composition SiH(OH)<sub>3</sub>. It is obtained by slowly
passing the vapour of silicon chloroform into cold water: SiHCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = SiH(OH)<sub>3</sub> + 3HCl.
But this hydrate, like the corresponding hydrate of phosphorus or carbon, does not
remain in this state of hydration, but loses a portion of its water. The carbon hydrate of
this nature, CH(OH)<sub>3</sub>, loses water and forms formic acid, CHO(OH); but the silicon
hydrate loses a still greater proportion of water, 2SiH(OH)<sub>3</sub>, parting with 3H<sub>2</sub>O, and
consequently leaving Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This substance must be an anhydride; all the hydrogen
previously in the form of hydroxyl has been disengaged, two remaining hydrogens being
left from SiH<sub>4</sub>. The other similar hydrate is also white, and has the composition Si<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O
(nearly). It may be regarded as the above white hydrate + SiO<sub>2</sub>. A yellow hydrate,
known as <i>chryseone</i> (silicone), is obtained by the action of hydrochloric acid on an alloy
of silicon and calcium; its composition is about Si<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Most probably, however,
chryseone has a more complex composition, and stands in the same relation to the hydrate
SiH<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub> as leucone does to the hydrate SiH(OH)<sub>3</sub>, because this very simply expresses
the transition of the first compound into the second with the loss of water,
SiH<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub> - H<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = SiH(OH)<sub>3</sub>. When these lower hydrates are ignited without
access of air, they are decomposed into hydrogen, silicon, and silica&mdash;that is, it may be
supposed that they form silicon hydride (which decomposes into silicon and hydrogen)
and silica (just as phosphorous and hypophosphorous acids give phosphoric acid and
phosphuretted hydrogen). When ignited in air, they burn, forming silica. They are
none of them acted on by acids, but when treated with alkalis they evolve hydrogen and
give silicates; for example, leucone: SiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 4KHO = 2SiK<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2H<sub>2</sub>. They
have no acid properties.</p></div>

from each other by their relation to polarised light; one rotates the plane of polarisation
to the right and the other to the left&mdash;in the one the hemihedral faces are right and in
the other they are left; this opposite rotatory power is taken advantage of in the construction
of polarisers. But, with this physical difference&mdash;which is naturally dependent
on a certain difference in the distribution of the molecules&mdash;there is not only no observable
difference in the chemical properties, but not even in the density of the mass. Perfectly
pure rock crystal is a substance which is most invariable with respect to its specific
gravity. The numerous and accurate determinations made by Steinheil on the specific
gravity of rock crystal show that (if the crystal be free from flaws) it is very constant
and is equal to 2·66.</p></div>

is a particular mineral first found in Styria and known as <i>tridymite</i>. Its specific gravity
2·3 and form of crystals clearly distinguish it from rock crystal; its hardness is the same
as that of quartz&mdash;that is, slightly below that of the ruby and diamond.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_138" id="Footnote_13_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_138"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> There is a distinct rise of temperature (about 4°) when amorphous silica is
moistened with water. Benzene and amyl alcohol also give an observable rise of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_BIS_139" id="Footnote_13_BIS_139"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_BIS_139"><span class="label">[13 bis]</span></a> Silica also occurs in nature in two modifications. The opal and tripoli
(infusorial earth) have a specific gravity of about 2·2, and are comparatively easily
soluble in alkalis and hydrofluoric acid. Chalcedony and flint (tinted quartzose
concretions of aqueous origin), agate and similar forms of silica of undoubted aqueous
origin, although still containing a certain amount of water, have a specific gravity of 2·6,
and correspond with quartz in the difficulty with which they dissolve. This form of
silica sometimes permeates the cellulose of wood, forming one of the ordinary kinds of
petrified wood. The silica may be extracted from it by the action of hydrofluoric acid,
and the cellulose remains behind, which clearly shows that silica in a soluble form (see
sequel) has permeated into the cells, where it has deposited the hydrate, which has lost
water, and given a silica of sp. gr. 2·6. The quartzose stalactites found in certain caves
are also evidently of a similar aqueous origin; their sp. gr. is also 2·6. As crystals
of amethyst are frequently found among chalcedonies, and as Friedau and Sarrau (1879)
obtained crystals of rock crystal by heating soluble glass with an excess of hydrate of
silica in a closed vessel, there is no doubt but that rock crystal itself is formed in the
wet way from the gelatinous hydrate. Chroustchoff obtained it directly from soluble
silica. Thus this hydrate is able to form not only the variety having the specific gravity
2·2 but also the more stable variety of sp. gr. 2·6; and both exist with a small proportion
of water and in a perfectly anhydrous state in an amorphous and crystalline
form. All these facts are expressed by recognising silica as dimorphous, and their
cause must be looked for in a difference in the degree of polymerisation.</p></div>

on a large scale for technical purposes by the action of potassium (or sodium)
hydroxide in a steam boiler on tripoli or infusorial earth, which contains a large proportion
of amorphous silica. All solutions of the alkaline silicates have an alkaline reaction,
and are even decomposed by carbonic acid. They are chiefly used by the dyer, for the
same purposes as sodium aluminate, and also for giving a hardness and polish to stucco
and other cements, and in general to substances which contain lime. A lump of chalk
when immersed in soluble glass, or better still when moistened with a solution and
afterwards washed in water (or better in hydrofluosilicic acid, in order to bind together
the free alkali and make it insoluble), becomes exceedingly hard, loses its friability,
is rendered cohesive, and cannot be levigated in water. This transformation is
due to the fact that the hydrate of silica present in the solution acts upon the lime,
forming a stony mass of calcium silicate, whilst the carbonic acid previously in combination
with the lime enters into combination with the alkali and is washed away by
the water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_142" id="Footnote_15_142"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_142"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The equation given above does not express the actual reaction, for in the first
place silica has the faculty of forming compounds with bases, and therefore the formula
SiNa<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is not rightly deduced, if one may so express oneself. And, in the second
place, silica gives several hydrates. In consequence of this, the hydrate precipitated
does not actually contain so high a proportion of water as Si(OH)<sub>4</sub>, but always less.
The insoluble gelatinous hydrate which separates out is able (before, but not after,
having been dried) to dissolve in a solution of sodium carbonate. When dried in air its
composition corresponds with the ordinary salts of carbonic acid&mdash;that is, SiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or
SiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>. If gradually heated it loses water by degrees, and, in so doing, gives various
degrees of combination with it. The existence of these degrees of hydration, having the
composition SiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><i>n</i>SiO<sub>2</sub>, or, in general, <i>n</i>SiO<sub>2</sub><i>m</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, where <i>m</i> &lt; <i>n</i>, must be recognised,
because most varied degrees of combination of silica with bases are known. The
hydrate of silica, when not dried above 30°, has a composition of nearly H<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
= (H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>2</sub>, but at 60° contains a greater proportion of silica&mdash;that is, it loses still
more water; and at 100° a hydrate of the composition SiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>2SiO<sub>2</sub>, and at 250° a
hydrate having approximately a composition SiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>7SiO<sub>2</sub> is obtained.</p>

<p>These data show the complexity of the molecules of anhydrous silica. The hydrates
of silica easily lose water and give the hydrates (SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><i>m</i></sub>, where <i>m</i> becomes
smaller and smaller than <i>n</i>. In the natural hydrates, this decrement of water proceeds
quite consecutively, and, so to say, imperceptibly, until <i>n</i> becomes incomparably greater
than <i>m</i>, and when the ratio becomes very large, anhydrous silica of the two modifications
2·6 and 2·2 is obtained. The composition (SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>10</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O still corresponds with 2·9 p.c. of
water, and natural hydrates often contain still less water than this. Thus some opals
are known which contain only 1 p.c. of water, whilst others contain 7 and even 10 p.c.
As the artificially prepared gelatinous hydrate of silica when dried has many of the
properties of native opals, and as this hydrate always loses water easily and continually,
there can be no doubt that the transition of (SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><i>m</i></sub> into anhydrous
silica, both amorphous and crystalline (in nature, chalcedony), is accomplished gradually.
This can only be the case if the magnitude of <i>n</i> be considerable, and therefore the
molecule of silica in the hydrate is undoubtedly complex, and hence the anhydrous
silica of sp. gr. 2·2 and 2·6 does not contain SiO<sub>2</sub>, but a complex molecule, Si<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>&mdash;that
is, the structure of silica is polymeric and complex, and not simple as represented above
by the formula SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_143" id="Footnote_16_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_143"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The presence of an excess of acid aids the retention of the silica in the solution,
because the gelatinous silica obtained in the above manner, but not heated to 60°&mdash;that
is, containing more water than the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;is more soluble in water containing
acid than in pure water. This would seem to indicate a feeble tendency of silica to
combine with acids, and it might even have been imagined that in such a solution the
hydrate of silica is held in combination by an excess of acid, had Graham not obtained
soluble silica perfectly free from acid, and if there were not solutions of silica free from
any acid in nature. At all events a tolerably strong solution of free silica or silicic
acid may be obtained from soluble glass diluted with water. The solution, besides silica,
will contain sodium chloride and an excess of the acid taken. If this solution remains for
some time exposed to the air, or in a closed vessel, and under various other conditions,
it is found that, after a time, insoluble gelatinous silica separates out&mdash;that is, the soluble
form of silica is unstable, like the soluble form of alumina. The analogous forms of
molybdic or tungstic acids may be heated, evaporated, and kept for a long period of time
without the soluble form being converted into the insoluble.</p></div>

the solutions from the leaves and stems penetrate into the roots and other parts in the
form of hydrosols, where they are converted into hydrogels&mdash;that is, into an insoluble form,
which is acted on with difficulty and is easily kept unaltered until the period of growth&mdash;for
example, until the following spring&mdash;when they are reconverted into hydrosols, and
the insoluble substance re-enters into the sap, and serves as a source of the hydrogels in

have a high molecular weight and a large molecular volume&mdash;in consequence of which they
do not penetrate through membranes, and are easily subject to variation in their physical
and chemical properties (owing to their complex structure and polymerism?) They have
but little chemical energy, and are generally feeble acids, if belonging to the order of
oxides or hydrates, such as the hydrates of molybdic and tungstic acids (Chapter <a href="#Page_276">XXI.</a>).
But now the number of substances capable, like colloids, of passing into aqueous solutions
and of easily separating out from them, as well as of appearing in an insoluble form, must
be supplemented by various other substances, among which soluble gold and silver
(Chapter <a href="#Page_398">XXIV.</a>) are of particular interest. So that now it may be said that the capacity
of forming colloid solutions is not limited to a definite class of compounds, but is, if not
a general, at all events, an exceedingly widely distributed phenomenon.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_147" id="Footnote_20_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_147"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> This is in accordance with the generally-accepted representation of the relations
between salts and the hydrates of acids, but it is of little help in the study of siliceous
compounds. Generally speaking, it becomes necessary to explain the property of
(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub> to combine with (RO)<sub><i>m</i></sub>, where <i>n</i> may be greater than <i>m</i>, and where R may be
H<sub>2</sub>, Ca, &amp;c. Here we are aided by those facts which have been attained by the investigation
of carbon compounds, especially with respect to glycol. Glycol is a compound having
the composition C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, only differing from alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, by an extra atom of oxygen.
This hydrate contains two hydroxyl groups, which may be successively replaced by
chlorine, &amp;c. Hence the composition of glycol should be represented as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>.
It has been found that glycol forms so-called polyglycols. Their origin will be understood
from the fact that glycol as a hydrate has a corresponding anhydride of the
composition C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, known as ethylene oxide. This substance is ethane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, in which
two hydrogens are replaced by one atom of oxygen. Ethylene oxide is not the only
anhydride of glycol, although it is the simplest one, because C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O.
Various other anhydrides of glycol are possible, and have actually been obtained, of the
composition <i>n</i>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> - (<i>n</i> - 1)H<sub>2</sub>O = (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. These imperfect anhydrides
of glycol, or <i>polyglycols</i>, still contain hydroxyls like glycol itself, and therefore
are of an alcoholic character in the same sense as glycol itself. They are obtained by
various methods, and, amongst others, by the direct combination of ethylene oxide with
glycol, because C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> + (<i>n</i> - 1)C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O = (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub><i>n</i>-1</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The most important
circumstance, from a theoretical point of view, is that these polyglycols may be distilled
without undergoing decomposition, and that the general formula given above expresses
their actual molecular composition. Hence we have here a direct combination of the anhydride
with the hydrate, and, moreover, a repeated one. The formula A<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2</sub>O may be used
to express the composition of glycol and polyglycols with respect to ethylene oxide in the
most simple manner, if A stand for ethylene oxide. When <i>n</i> = 1 we have glycol, when
<i>n</i> is greater than 1 a polyglycol. Such also is the relationship of the salts of hydrate of
silica, if A stand for silica, and if we imagine that H<sub>2</sub>O may also be taken <i>m</i> times.
Such a representation of the <i>polysilicic acids</i> corresponds with the representation of the
polymerism of silica. Laurent supposed the existence of several polymeric forms, Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,
Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, &amp;c., besides silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_148" id="Footnote_21_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_148"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> For us the latter have not a saline character, only because they are not regarded
from this point of view, but an alloy of sodium and zinc is, in a broad sense, a salt in many
of its reactions, for it is subject to the same double decompositions as sodium phosphide
or sulphide, which clearly have saline properties. The latter (sodium phosphide), when
heated with ethyl iodide, forms ethyl phosphide, and the former&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the alloy of zinc
and sodium&mdash;gives zinc ethyl; that is, the element (P, S, Zn) which was united with the
sodium passes into combination with the ethyl: RNa + EtI = REt + NaI. By combining
sodium successively with chlorine, sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, tin,
and zinc, we obtain substances having less and less the ordinary appearance of salts, but
if the alloy of sodium and zinc cannot be termed a salt, then perhaps this name cannot be
given to sodium sulphide, and the compounds of sodium with phosphorus. The following
circumstance may also be observed: with chlorine, sodium gives only one compound (with
oxygen, at the most three), with sulphur five, with phosphorus probably still more, with
antimony naturally still more, and the more analogous an element is to sodium, the more
varied are the proportions in which it is able to combine with it, the less are the alterations
in the properties which take place by this combination, and the nearer does the
compound formed approach to the class of compounds known as indefinite chemical
compounds. In this sense a siliceous alloy, containing silica and other acids, is a
salt. The oxide to a certain extent plays the same part as the sodium, whilst the silica
plays the part of the acid element which was taken up successively by zinc, phosphorus,
sulphur, &amp;c., in the above examples. Such a comparison of the silica compounds with
alloys presents the great advantage of including under one category the definite and
indefinite silica compounds which are so analogous in composition&mdash;that is, brings
under one head such crystalline substances as certain minerals, and such amorphous
substances as are frequently met with in nature, and are artificially prepared, as glass,
slags, enamels, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the compounds of silica are substances like the metallic alloys, then (1) the chemical
union between the oxides of which they are composed must be a feeble one, as it is in all
compounds formed between analogous substances. In reality such feeble agencies as
water and carbonic acid are able, although slowly, to act on and destroy the majority
of the complex silica compounds in rocks, as we saw in the preceding chapter; (2)
their formation, like that of alloys, should not be accompanied by a considerable
alteration of volume; and this is actually the case. For example, felspar has a specific
gravity of about 2·6, and therefore, taking its composition to be K<sub>2</sub>O,Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,6SiO<sub>2</sub>, we find
its volume, corresponding with this formula, to be 556·8. 2·6 = 214, the volume of K<sub>2</sub>O = 35,
of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 26, and of SiO<sub>2</sub> = 22·6. Hence the sum of the volumes of the component
oxides, 35 + 26 + 6 × 22·6 = 196, which is very nearly equal to that of the felspar; that is,
its formation is attended by a slight expansion, and not by contraction, as is the case in
the majority of other cases when combinations determined by strong affinities are
accomplished. In the case in question the same phenomenon is observed as in solutions
and alloys&mdash;that is, as in cases of feeble affinities. So also the specific gravity of glass
is directly dependent on the amount of those oxides which enter into its composition. If
in the preceding example we take the sp. gr. of silica to be, not 2·65, but 2·2, its volume
= 27·3, and the sum of the volumes will be = 224&mdash;that is, greater than that of orthoclase.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_149" id="Footnote_22_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_149"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> It is, however, easy to imagine, and experience confirms the supposition, that in a
complex siliceous compound containing for instance sodium and calcium, the whole of the
sodium may be replaced by potassium, and <i>at the same time</i> the whole of the calcium
by magnesium, because then the substitution of potassium for the sodium will produce a
change in the nature of the substance contrary to that which will occur from the calcium
being replaced by magnesium. That increase in weight, decrease in density, increase of
chemical energy, which accompanies the exchange of sodium for potassium will, so to
speak, be compensated by the exchange of calcium for magnesium, because both in
weight and in properties the sum of Na + Ca is very near to the sum of K + Mg.
<i>Pyroxene</i> or <i>augite</i> can be taken as an example; its composition may be expressed by
the formula CaMgSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>; that is, it corresponds with the acid H<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>; it is a bisilicate.
In many respects it closely resembles another mineral called &lsquo;<i>spodumene</i>&rsquo; (they are
both monoclinic). This latter has the composition Li<sub>6</sub>Al<sub>8</sub>Si<sub>15</sub>O<sub>45</sub>. On reducing both
formulæ to an equal contents of silica the following distinction will be observed between
them: spodumene (Li<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>8</sub>30SiO<sub>2</sub>; augite (CaO)<sub>15</sub>(MgO)<sub>15</sub>30SiO<sub>2</sub>. That is, the
difference between them consists in the sum of the magnesia and lime (MgO)<sub>15</sub> + (CaO)<sub>15</sub>
replacing the sum of the lithium oxide and alumina (Li<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub> + (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>8</sub>; and in the
chemical relation these sums are near to one another, because magnesium and calcium,
both in forms of oxidation and in energy (as bases), in all respects occupy a position
intermediate between lithium and aluminium, and therefore the sum of the first may be
replaced by the sum of the second.</p>

<p>If we take the composition of spodumene, as it is often represented to be,
Li<sub>2</sub>O,Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,4SiO<sub>2</sub>, the corresponding formula of augite will be (CaO)<sub>2</sub>,(MgO)<sub>2</sub>,4SiO<sub>2</sub>,
and also the amount of oxygen in the sum of Li<sub>2</sub>OAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> will be the same as in (CaO)<sub>2</sub>(MgO)<sub>2</sub>.
I may remark, for the sake of clearness, that lithium belongs to the first, aluminium to the
third group, and calcium and magnesium to the intermediate second group; lithium, like
calcium, belongs to the even series, and magnesium and aluminium to the uneven.</p>

<p>The representation of the substitutions of analogous compounds here introduced was
first deduced by me in 1856. It finds much confirmation in facts which have been subsequently
discovered&mdash;for example, with respect to tourmalin. Wülfing (1888), on the
basis of a number of analyses (especially of those by Röggs), states that all varieties contain
an isomorphous mixture of alkali and magnesia tourmalin; into the composition
of the former there enters 12SiO<sub>2</sub>,3B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,8Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2Na<sub>2</sub>O,4H<sub>2</sub>O, and of the latter
12SiO<sub>2</sub>,3B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,5Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,12MgO,3H<sub>2</sub>O. Hence it is seen that the former contains in addition
the sum of 3Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2Na<sub>2</sub>O,H<sub>2</sub>O, whilst in the latter this sum of oxides is replaced by
12MgO, in which there is as much oxygen as in the sum of the more clearly-defined base
2Na<sub>2</sub>O and less basic 3Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;that is, the relation is just the same here as between
augite and spodumene.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_150" id="Footnote_23_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_150"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> With respect to the silica compounds of the various oxides, it must be observed
that only the <i>alkali salts</i> are known in a soluble form; all the others only exist in an
insoluble form, so that a solution of the alkali compounds of silica, or soluble glass, gives
a precipitate with a solution of the salts of the majority of other metals, and this precipitate
will contain the silica compounds of the other bases. The maximum amount of
the gelatinous hydrate of silica, which dissolves in caustic potash, corresponds with the
formation of a compound, 2K<sub>2</sub>O,9SiO<sub>2</sub>. But this compound is partially decomposed, with
the precipitation of hydrate of silica, on cooling the solution. Solutions containing a
smaller amount of silica may be kept for an indefinite time without decomposing, and
silica does not separate out from the solution; but such compounds crystallise from the
solutions with difficulty. However, a crystalline bisilicate (with water) has been obtained
for sodium having the composition Na<sub>2</sub>O,SiO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> corresponding to sodium carbonate.
The whole of the carbonic acid is evolved, and a similar soluble sodium metasilicate is
obtained on fusing 3·5 parts of sodium carbonate with 2 parts of silica. If less silica be
taken a portion of the sodium carbonate remains undecomposed; however, a substance
may then be obtained of the composition Si(ONa)<sub>4</sub>, corresponding with orthosilicic acid.
It contains the maximum amount of sodium oxide capable of combining with silica under
fusion. It is a sodium orthosilicate, (Na<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>,SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Calcium carbonate, and the carbonates of the alkaline earths in general, also evolve
all their carbonic acid when heated with silica, and in some instances even form somewhat
fusible compounds. Lime forms a fusible slag of <i>calcium silicate</i>, of the composition
CaO,SiO<sub>2</sub> and 2CaO,3SiO<sub>2</sub>. With a larger proportion of silica the slags are infusible in a
furnace. The magnesium <i>slags</i> are less fusible than those with lime, and are often
formed in smelting metals. Many compounds of the metals of the alkaline earths with
silica are also met with in nature. For instance, among the magnesium compounds there
is <i>olivine</i>, (MgO)<sub>2</sub>,SiO<sub>2</sub>, sp. gr. 3·4, which occurs in meteorites, and sometimes forms a
precious stone (peridote), and occurs in slags and basalts. It is decomposed by acids, is
infusible before the blow-pipe, and crystallises in the rhombic system. <i>Serpentine</i> has
the composition 3MgO,2SiO<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O; it sometimes forms whole mountains, and is distinguished
for its great cohesiveness, and is therefore used in the arts. It is generally
tinted green; its specific gravity is 2·5; it is exceedingly infusible, even before the blowpipe.
It is acted on by acids. Among the magnesium compounds of silica, <i>talc</i> is very
widely used. It is frequently met with in rocks which are widely distributed in nature,
and sometimes in compact masses; it can be used for writing like a slate pencil or chalk,
and being greasy to the touch, is also known as <i>steatite</i>. It crystallises in the rhombic
system, and resembles mica in many respects; like it, it is divisible into laminæ, greasy
to the touch, and having a sp. gr. 2·7. These laminæ are very soft, lustrous, and
transparent, and are infusible and insoluble in acids. The composition of talc approaches
nearly to 6MgO,5SiO<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Among the crystalline silicates the following minerals are known:&mdash;<i>Wollastonite</i>
(tabular-spar), crystallises in the monoclinic system; sp. gr. 2·8; it is semi-transparent,
difficultly fusible, decomposed by acids, and has the composition of a metasilicate,
CaOSiO<sub>2</sub>. But isomorphous mixtures of calcium and magnesium silicates occur with
particular frequency in nature. The <i>augites</i> (sp. gr. 3·3), diallages, hypersthenes, hornblendes
(sp. gr. 3·1), amphiboles, common asbestos, and many similar minerals, sometimes
forming the essential parts of entire rock formations, contain various relative
proportions of the bisilicates of calcium and magnesium partially mixed with other
metallic silicates, and generally anhydrous, or only containing a small amount of water.
In the pyroxenes, as a rule, lime predominates, and in the amphiboles (also of the
monoclinic system) magnesia predominates. Details upon this subject must be looked
for in works upon mineralogy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_151" id="Footnote_24_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_151"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The majority of the siliceous minerals have now been obtained artificially under
various conditions. Thus N. N. Sokoloff showed that slags very frequently contain
peridote. Hautefeuille, Chroustchoff, Friedel, and Sarasin obtained felspar identical in
all respects with the natural minerals. The details of the methods here employed must
be looked for in special works on mineralogy; but, as an example, we will describe the
method of the preparation of felspar employed by Friedel and Sarasin (1881). From
the fact that felspar gives up potassium silicate to water even at the ordinary temperature
(Debray's experiments), they concluded that the felspar in granites had an
aqueous origin (and this may be supposed to be the case from geological data); then, in
the first place, its formation could not be accomplished unless in the presence of an
excess of a solution of potassium silicate. In order to render this argument clear I
may mention, as an example, that carnallite is decomposed by water into easily soluble
magnesium chloride and potassium chloride, and therefore if it is of aqueous origin it
could not be formed otherwise than from a solution containing an excess of magnesium
chloride, and, in the second place, from a strongly-heated solution; again, felspar itself
and its fellow-components in granites are anhydrous. On these facts were based
experiments of heating hydrates of silica with alumina and a solution of potassium
silicate in a closed vessel. The mixture was placed in a sealed platinum tube, which
was enclosed in a steel tube and heated to dull redness. When the mixture contained
an excess of silica the residue contained many crystals of rock crystal and
tridymite, together with a powder of felspar, which formed the main product of the
reaction when the proportion of hydrate of silica was decreased, and a mixture of a
solution of potassium silicate with alumina precipitated together with the silica by mixing
soluble glass with aluminium chloride was employed. The composition, properties, and
forms of the resultant felspar proved it to be identical with that found in nature. The
experiments approach very nearly to the natural conditions, all the more as felspar and
quartz are obtained together in one mixture, as they so often occur in nature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_152" id="Footnote_25_152"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_152"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The application of <i>cements</i> is based on this principle; they are those sorts of
&lsquo;hydraulic&rsquo; lime which generally form a stony mass, which hardens even under water,
when mixed with sand and water.</p>

<p>The hydraulic properties of cements are due to their containing calcareous and silico-aluminous
compounds which are able to combine with water and form hydrates, which
are then unacted on by water. This is best proved, in the first place, by the fact that
certain slags containing lime and silica, and obtained by fusion (for example, in blast-furnaces),
solidify like cements when finely ground and mixed with water; and, in the
second place, by the method now employed for the manufacture of artificial cements
(formerly only peculiar and comparatively rare natural products were used). For this
purpose a mixture of lime and clay is taken, containing about 25 p.c. of the latter; this
mixture is then heated, not to fusion, but until both the carbonic anhydride and water
contained in the clay are expelled. This mass when finely ground forms Portland cement,
which hardens under water. The process of hardening is based on the formation of
chemical compounds between the lime, silica, alumina, and water. These substances are
also found combined together in various natural minerals&mdash;for example, in the zeolites,
as we saw above. In all cases cement which has set contains a considerable amount of
water, and its hardening is naturally due to hydration&mdash;that is, to the formation of
compounds with water. Well-prepared and very finely-ground cement hardens
comparatively quickly (in several days, especially after being rammed down), with 3 parts
(and even more) of coarse sand and with water, into a stony mass which is as hard and
durable as many stones, and more so than bricks and limestone. Hence not only all
maritime constructions (docks, ports, bridges, &amp;c.), but also ordinary buildings, are made
of Portland cement, and are distinguished for their great durability. A combination of
ironwork (ties, girders) and cement is particularly suitable for the construction of aqueducts,
arches, reservoirs, &amp;c. Arches and walls made of such cements may be much
less thick than those built up of ordinary stone. Hence the production and use of
cement rapidly increases from year to year. The origin of accurate data respecting
cements is chiefly due to Vicat. In Russia Professor Schuliachenko has greatly aided
the extension of accurate data concerning Portland cement. Many works for the manufacture
of cement have already been established in various parts of Russia, and this
industry promises a great future in the arts of construction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_153" id="Footnote_26_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_153"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> <i>Glass</i> presents a similar complex composition, like that of many minerals. The
ordinary sorts of white glass contain about 75 p.c. of silica, 13 p.c. of sodium oxide, and
12 p.c of lime; but the inferior sorts of glass sometimes contain up to 10 p.c. of alumina.
The mixtures which are used for the manufacture of glass are also most varied. For
example, about 300 parts of pure sand, about 100 parts of sodium carbonate, and 50 of
limestone are taken, and sometimes double the proportion of the latter. Ordinary <i>soda-glass</i>
contains sodium oxide, lime, and silica as the chief component parts. It is generally
prepared from sodium sulphate mixed with charcoal, silica, and lime (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_513">XII.</a>),
in which case the following reaction takes place at a high temperature: Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + C + SiO<sub>2</sub>
= Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + CO. Sometimes potassium carbonate is taken for the preparation of
the better qualities of glass. In this case a glass, <i>potash-glass</i>, is obtained containing
potassium oxide instead of sodium oxide. The best-known of these glasses is the so-called
Bohemian glass or crystal, which is prepared by the fusion of 50 parts of potassium
carbonate, 15 parts of lime, and 100 parts of quartz. The preceding kinds of glass contain
lime, whilst crystal glass contains lead oxide instead. Flint glass&mdash;that is, the lead glass
used for optical instruments&mdash;is prepared in this manner, naturally from the purest
possible materials.  <i>Crystal-glass</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> glass containing lead oxide&mdash;is softer than
ordinary glass, more fusible and has a higher index of refraction. However, although
the materials for the preparation of glass be most carefully sorted, a certain amount
of iron oxides falls into the glass and renders it greenish. This coloration may
be destroyed by adding a number of substances to the vitreous mass, which are able
to convert the ferrous oxide into ferric oxide; for example, manganese peroxide
(because the peroxide is deoxidised to manganous oxide, which only gives a pale violet
tint to the glass) and arsenious anhydride, which is deoxidised to arsenic, and this is
volatilised. The manufacture of glass is carried on in furnaces giving a very high temperature
(often in regenerative furnaces, Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_379">IX.</a>). Large clay crucibles are placed
in these furnaces, and the mixture destined for the preparation of the glass, having been
first roasted, is charged into the crucibles. The temperature of the furnace is then gradually
raised. The process takes place in three separate stages. At first the mass intermixes
and begins to react; then it fuses, evolves carbonic acid gas, and forms a molten
mass; and, lastly, at the highest temperature, it becomes homogeneous and quite liquid,
which is necessary for the ultimate elimination of the carbonic anhydride and solid impurities,
which latter collect at the bottom of the crucible. The temperature is then somewhat
lowered, and the glass is taken out on tubes and blown into objects of various shapes.
In the manufacture of window-glass it is blown into large cylinders, which are then cut at
the ends and across, and afterwards bent back in a furnace into the ordinary sheets. After
being worked up, all glass objects have to be subjected to a slow cooling (<i>annealing</i>) in
special furnaces, otherwise they are very brittle, as is seen in the so-called &lsquo;Rupert's
drops,&rsquo; formed by dropping molten glass into water; although these drops preserve their
form, they are so brittle that they break up into a fine powder if a small piece be knocked
off them. Glass objects have frequently to be polished and chased. In the manufacture
of mirrors and many massive objects the glass is cast and then ground and
polished. Coloured glasses are either made by directly introducing into the glass itself
various oxides, which give their characteristic tints, or else a thin layer of a coloured
glass is laid on the surface of ordinary glass. Green glasses are formed by the oxides
of chromium and copper, blue by cobalt oxide, violet by manganese oxide, and red glass
by cuprous oxide and by the so-called purple of Cassius&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a compound of gold and
tin&mdash;which will be described later. A yellow coloration is obtained by means of the
oxides of iron, silver, or antimony, and also by means of carbon, especially for the brown
tints for certain kinds of bottle-glass.</p>

<p>From what has been said about glass it will be understood that it is impossible to
give a definite formula for it, because it is a non-crystalline or amorphous alloy of
silicates; but such an alloy can only be formed within certain limits in the proportions
between the component oxides. With a large proportion of silica the glass very easily
becomes clouded when heated; with a considerable proportion of alkalis it is easily
acted on by moisture, and becomes cloudy in time on exposure to the air; with a large
proportion of lime it becomes infusible and opaque, owing to the formation of crystalline
compounds in it; in a word, a certain proportion is practically attained among the component
oxides in order that the glass formed may have suitable properties. Nevertheless,
it may be well to remark that the composition of common glass approaches to the
formula Na<sub>2</sub>O,CaO,4SiO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The coefficient of cubical expansion of glass is nearly equal to that of platinum and
iron, being approximately 0·000027. The specific heat of glass is nearly 0·18, and the
specific gravity of common soda glass is nearly 2·5, of Bohemian glass 2·4, and of bottle
glass 2·7. Flint glass is much heavier than common glass, because it contains the
heavier oxide of lead, its specific gravity being 2·9 to 3·2.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_154" id="Footnote_27_154"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_154"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> It must be recollected that although acids seem to act only feebly on the majority
of silicates, nevertheless a finely-levigated powder of siliceous compounds is acted on by
strong acids, especially with the aid of heat, the basic oxides being taken up and gelatinous
silica left behind. In this respect sulphuric acid heated to 200° with finely-divided
siliceous compounds in a closed tube acts very energetically.</p></div>

common group by means of the periodic law, although the quadrivalency of tin and lead

spectrum in the Bunsen's flame, and the solubility of many of the compounds of
germanium, presented difficulties in the researches of Professor Winkler, who, on
analysing argyrodite by the usual method, obtained a constant loss of 7 p.c., and was
thus led to search for a new element. The presence of arsenic and antimony in the
accompanying minerals also impeded the separation of the new metal. After fusion with
sulphur and sodium carbonate, argyrodite gives a solution of a sulphide which is precipitated
by an <i>excess</i> of hydrochloric acid; germanium sulphide is soluble in ammonia
and then precipitated by hydrochloric acid, as a <i>white</i> precipitate, which is dissolved
(or decomposed) by water. After being oxidised by nitric acid, dried and ignited
germanium sulphide leaves the oxide GeO<sub>2</sub>, which is reduced to the metal when ignited
in a stream of hydrogen.</p></div>

substance, which may perhaps be the hydrate of germanious oxide, GeO, and acts as a

<p>The coating of iron by tin, guards it against the direct access of air, but it only preserves
the iron from oxidation so long as it forms a perfectly continuous coating. If
the iron is left bare in certain places, it will be powerfully oxidised at these spots,
because the tin is electro-negative with respect to the iron, and thus the oxidation
is confined entirely to the iron in the presence of tin. Hence a coating of tin over
iron objects only partially preserves them from rusting. In this respect a coating of
zinc is more effectual. However, a dense and invariable alloy is formed over the
surface of contact of the iron and tin, which binds the coating of tin to the remaining
mass of the iron. Tin may be fused with cast iron, and gives a greyish-white alloy,
which is very easily cast, and is used for casting many objects for which iron by itself
would be unsuitable owing to its ready oxidisability and porosity. The coating of copper
objects by tin is generally done to preserve the copper from the action of acid liquids,
which would attack the copper in the presence of air and convert it into soluble salts.
Tin is not acted on in this manner, and therefore copper vessels for the preparation of
food should be tinned.</p></div>

11 p.c. of tin (corresponding with the ratio Cu<sub>15</sub>Sn) is known as gun-metal. The addition
of a small quantity of phosphorus, up to 2 p.c., renders bronze still harder and more
elastic, and the alloy so formed is now used under the name of phosphor-bronze.</p>

copper or tin in its appearance or properties. It remains perfectly homogeneous on cooling,
and acquires a crystalline structure (Riche). All these signs clearly indicate that
the alloy SnCu<sub>3</sub> is a product of chemical combination, which is also seen to be the case
from its density, 8·91. Had there been no contraction, the density of the alloy would be
8·21. It is the heaviest of all the alloys of tin and copper, because the density of tin is
7·29 and of copper 8·8. The alloy SnCu<sub>4</sub>, specific gravity 8·77, has similar properties.
All the alloys except SnCu<sub>3</sub> and SnCu<sub>4</sub> split up on cooling; a portion richer in copper
solidifies first (this phenomenon is termed the <i>liquation</i> of an alloy), but the above two
alloys do not split up on cooling. In these and many similar facts we can clearly distinguish
a <i>chemical union between the metals</i> forming an alloy. The alloys of tin and
copper were known in very remote ages, before iron was used. The alloys of zinc and
tin are less used, but alloys composed of zinc, tin, and copper frequently replace the more
costly bronze. Concerning the alloys of lead <i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_46_178">46</a>.</p></div>

amongst others, by the application of Raoult's method (Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_49_96">49</a>) to solutions
of different metals in tin. Thus Heycock and Neville (1889) showed that the temperature
of solidification of molten tin (226°·4) is lowered by the presence of a small quantity of other
metals in proportion to the concentration of the solution. The following were the reductions
of the temperature of solidification of tin obtained by dissolving in it atomic proportions
of different metals (for example, 65 parts of zinc in 11,800 parts of tin); Zn 2°·53,
Cu 2°·47, Ag 2°·67, Cd 2°·16, Pb 2°·22, Hg 2°·3, Sb 2° [rise], Al 1°·34. As Raoult's method
(Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_299">VII.</a>) enables the molecular weight to be determined, the almost perfect identity
of the resultant figures (except for aluminium) shows that the molecules of copper, silver,
lead, and antimony contain <i>one atom in the molecule</i>, like zinc, mercury, and cadmium.
They obtained the same result (1890) for Mg, Na, Ni, Au, Pd, Bi and In. It should here
be mentioned that Ramsay (1889) for the same purpose (the determination of the molecular
weight of metals on the basis of their mutual solution) took advantage of the
variation of the vapour tension of mercury (<i>see</i> Vol. I., p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_134">134</a>), containing various metals
in solution, and he also found that the above-mentioned metals contain but one atom in
the molecule.</p></div>

V. Meyer found the vapour density of stannous chloride, SnCl<sub>2</sub>, to be variable between its

(this salt as a reducing agent prevents the oxidation of the stannous compound) and dissolving
the washed precipitate in nitric acid, obtained crystals of <i>stannous nitrate</i>,
Sn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,20H<sub>2</sub>O, on refrigerating the solution. This crystallo-hydrate easily melts, and
is deliquescent. Besides this, a more stable anhydrous basic salt, Sn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,SnO, is
easily formed. In general, stannous oxide as a feeble base easily forms basic salts, just
as cupric and lead oxides do. For the same reason SnX<sub>2</sub> easily forms double salts.
Thus a potassium salt, SnK<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, and especially an ammonium salt, Sn(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,
called <i>pink salt</i>, are known. Some of these salts are used in the arts, owing to their
being more stable than tin salts alone. Stannous bromide and iodide, SnBr<sub>2</sub> and SnI<sub>2</sub>,
resemble the chloride in many respects.</p>

<p>Among other stannous salts a sulphate, SnSO<sub>4</sub>, is known. It is formed as a crystalline
powder when a solution of stannous oxide in sulphuric acid is evaporated under the
receiver of an air-pump. The feeble basic character of the stannous oxide is clearly
seen in this salt. It decomposes with extreme facility, when heated, into stannic oxide
and sulphurous anhydride, but it easily forms double salts with the salts of the alkali
metals.</p>

<p>In gaseous hydrochloric acid, stannous chloride, SnCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, forms a liquid having
the composition SnCl<sub>2</sub>,HCl,3H<sub>2</sub>O (sp gr. 2·2, freezes at -27°), and a solid salt, SnCl<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O
(Engel).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_170" id="Footnote_40_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_170"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Frémy supposes the cause of the difference to consist in a difference of polymerisation,
and considers that the ordinary acid corresponds with the oxide SnO<sub>2</sub>, and
the meta-acid with the oxide Sn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, but it is more probable that both are polymeric
but in a different degree. Stannic acid with sodium carbonate gives a salt of the composition
Na<sub>2</sub>SnO<sub>3</sub>. The same salt is also obtained by fusing metastannic acid with
sodium hydroxide, whilst metastannic acid gives a salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SnO<sub>3</sub>,4SnO<sub>2</sub> (Frémy), when
treated with a dilute solution of alkali; moreover, stannic acid is also soluble in the ordinary
stannate, Na<sub>2</sub>SnO<sub>3</sub> (Weber), so that both stannic acids (like both forms of silica) are
capable of polymerisation, and probably only differ in its degree. In general, there is
here a great resemblance to silica, and Graham obtained a solution of stannic acid by the
direct dialysis of its alkaline solution. The main difference between these acids is that
the meta-acid is soluble in hydrochloric acid, and gives a precipitate with sulphuric acid
and stannous chloride, which do not precipitate the ordinary acid. Vignon (1889)
found that more heat is evolved in dissolving stannic acid in KHO than metastannic.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_171" id="Footnote_41_171"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_171"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> The formation of the compound SnCl<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O is accompanied by so great a contraction
that these crystals, although they contain water, are heavier than the anhydrous
chloride SnCl<sub>4</sub>. The penta-hydrated crystallo-hydrate absorbs dry hydrochloric acid, and
gives a liquid of specific gravity 1·971, which at 0° yields crystals of the compound
SnCl<sub>4</sub>,2HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O (it corresponds with the similar platinum compound), which melt at 20°
into a liquid of specific gravity 1·925 (Engel).</p>

<p>Stannic chloride combines with ammonia (SnCl<sub>4</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>), hydrocyanic acid, phosphoretted
hydrogen, phosphorus pentachloride (SnCl<sub>4</sub>,PCl<sub>5</sub>), nitrous anhydride and its
chloranhydride (SnCl<sub>4</sub>,N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SnCl<sub>4</sub>,2NOCl), and with metallic chlorides (for example,
K<sub>2</sub>SnCl<sub>6</sub>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SnCl<sub>6</sub>, &amp;c.) In general, a highly-developed faculty for combination is
observed in it.</p>

<p>Tin does not combine directly with iodine, but if its filings be heated in a closed tube
with a solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, it forms stannic iodide, SnI<sub>4</sub>, in the form
of red octahedra which fuse at 142° and volatilise at 295°. The fluorine compounds of
tin have a special interest in the history of chemistry, because they give a series of
double salts which are isomorphous with the salts of hydrofluosilicic acid, SiR<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, and
this fact served to confirm the formula SiO<sub>2</sub> for silica, as the formula SnO<sub>2</sub> was indubitable.
Although <i>stannic fluoride</i>, SnF<sub>4</sub>, is almost unknown in the free state, its
corresponding double salts are very easily formed by the action of hydrofluoric acid on
alkaline solutions of stannic oxide; thus, for example, a crystalline salt of the composition
SnK<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O is obtained by dissolving stannic oxide in potassium hydroxide and
then adding hydrofluoric acid to the solution. The barium salt, SnBaF<sub>6</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, is
sparingly soluble like its corresponding silicofluoride. The more soluble salt of strontium,
SnSrF<sub>6</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, crystallises very well, and is therefore more important for the purposes of
research; it is isomorphous with the corresponding salt of silicon (and titanium); the
magnesium salt contains 6H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Stannic sulphide, SnS<sub>2</sub>, is formed, as a yellow precipitate, by the action of sulphuretted
hydrogen on acid solutions of stannic salts; it is easily soluble in ammonium
and potassium sulphides, because it has an acid character, and then forms thiostannates
(see Chapter <a href="#Page_200">XX.</a>). In an anhydrous state it has the form of brilliant golden yellow
plates, which may be obtained by heating a mixture of finely-divided tin, sulphur, and
sal-ammoniac for a considerable time. It is sometimes used in this form under the
name of mosaic gold, as a cheap substitute for gold-leaf in gilding wood articles. On
ignition it parts with a portion of its sulphur, and is converted into stannous sulphide
SnS. It is soluble in caustic alkalis. Hydrochloric acid does not dissolve the anhydrous
crystalline compound, but the precipitated powdery sulphide is soluble in boiling strong
hydrochloric acid, with the evolution of hydrogen sulphide.</p></div>

salts, as a heavy white precipitate, which is insoluble in water and acids, but dissolves

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_176" id="Footnote_44_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_176"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> According to J. B. Hannay (1894) the last named decomposition (PbS + PbSO<sub>4</sub>
= 2Pb + 2SO<sub>2</sub>) is really much more complicated, and in fact a portion of the PbS is
dissolved in the Pb, forming a slag containing PbO, PbS and PbSO<sub>4</sub>, whilst a portion
of the lead volatilises with the SO<sub>2</sub> in the form of a compound PbS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is also
formed in other cases, but has not yet been thoroughly studied.</p>

<p>Besides these methods for extracting lead from PBS in its ores, roasting (the removal
of the S in the form of SO<sub>2</sub>) and smelting with charcoal with a blast in the same
manner as in the manufacture of pig iron (Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII.</a>) are also employed.</p>

<p>We may add that PbS in contact with Zn and hydrochloric acid (which has no action
upon PbS alone) entirely decomposes, forming H<sub>2</sub>S and metallic lead: PbS + Zn + 2HCl
= Pb + ZnCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>

<p>As lead is easily reduced from its ores, and the ore itself has a metallic appearance, it
is not surprising that it was known to the ancients, and that its properties were familiar
to the alchemists, who called it &lsquo;Saturn.&rsquo; Hence metallic lead, reduced from its salts in

saturni,&rsquo; &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_178" id="Footnote_46_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_178"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> Lead is used in the arts, and owing to its considerable density, it is cast, mixed
with small quantities of other metals, into shot. A considerable amount is employed
(together with mercury) in extracting gold and silver from poor ores, and in the manufacture
of chemical reagents, and especially of lead chromate. <i>Lead chromate</i>, PbCrO<sub>4</sub>,
is distinguished for its brilliant yellow colour, owing to which it is employed in considerable
quantities as a dye, mainly for dyeing cotton tissues yellow. It is formed on the tissue
itself, by causing a soluble salt of lead to react on potassium chromate. Lead chromate
is met with in nature as &lsquo;red lead ore.&rsquo; It is insoluble in water and acetic acid, hut
it dissolves in aqueous potash. The so-called pewter vessels often consist of an alloy of
5 parts of tin and 1 part of lead, and solder is composed of 1 to 2 parts of tin with &frac12; part
of lead. Amongst the alloys of lead and tin, Rudberg states that the alloy PbSn<sub>3</sub> stands

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_179" id="Footnote_47_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_179"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> The normal lead acetate, known in trade as <i>sugar of lead</i>, owing to its having a
sweetish taste, has the formula Pb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. This salt only crystallises from acid
solutions. It is capable of dissolving a further quantity of lead oxide or of metallic lead in
the presence of air. A basic salt of the composition Pb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,PbH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is then formed
which is soluble in water and alcohol. As in this salt the number of atoms is even and the
same as in the hydrate of acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>, it may be represented as
this hydrate in which two of hydrogen are replaced by lead&mdash;that is, as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(OH)(O<sub>2</sub>Pb).
This basic salt is used in medicine as a remedy for inflammation, for bandaging wounds,
&amp;c., and also in the manufacture of white lead. Other basic acetates of lead,
containing a still greater amount of lead oxide, are known. According to the above
representation of the composition of the preceding lead acetate, a basic salt of the composition
(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(O<sub>2</sub>Pb)<sub>3</sub> would be also possible, but what appear to be still more basic
salts are known. As the character of a salt also depends on the property of the base
from which it is formed, it would seem that lead forms a hydroxide of the composition
HOPbOH, containing two water residues, one or both of which may be replaced by the
acid residues. If both water residues are replaced, a normal salt, XPbX, is obtained,
whilst if only one is replaced a basic salt, XPbOH, is formed. But lead does not only
give this normal hydroxide, but also polyhydroxides, Pb(OH),<i>n</i>PbO, and if we may imagine
that in these polyhydroxides there is a substitution of both the water residues by acid
residues, then the power of lead for forming basic salts is explained by the properties of
the base which enters into their composition.</p></div>

by the ignition of lead oxalate, C<sub>2</sub>PbO<sub>4</sub>, without access of air. It is a black powder,
which easily breaks up under the action of acids, and even by the simple action of heat,
into metallic lead and lead oxide. This is the character of all suboxides. They cannot
be regarded as independent salt-forming oxides, neither can those forms of oxidation of
lead which contain more oxygen than the oxide of lead, PbO, and less than the dioxide,
PbO<sub>2</sub>. As we shall see, at least two such compounds are formed. Thus, for example,
an oxide having the composition Pb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is known, but it is decomposed by the action of
acids into lead oxide, which passes into solution, and lead dioxide, which remains behind.
Such is red lead. (See further on.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_182" id="Footnote_50_182"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_182"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> It is very instructive to observe that lead not only easily forms basic salts, but also
salts containing several acid groups. Thus, for example, lead carbonate occurs in nature
and forms compounds with lead chloride and sulphate. The first compound, known as
<i>corneous lead</i>, <i>phosgenite</i>, has the composition PbCO<sub>3</sub>,PbCl<sub>2</sub>; it occurs in nature in bright
cubical crystals, and is prepared artificially by simply boiling lead chloride with lead
carbonate. A similar compound of normal salts, PbSO<sub>4</sub>,PbCO<sub>3</sub>, occurs in nature as
<i>lanarkite</i> in monoclinic crystals. <i>Leadhillite</i> contains PbSO<sub>4</sub>,3PbCO<sub>3</sub>, and also occurs
in yellowish, monoclinic, tabular crystals. We will turn our attention to these salts of
lead, because it is very probable that their formation is allied to the formation of the
basic salts, and the following considerations may lead to the explanation of the existence
of both. In describing silica we carefully developed the conception of polymerisation,
which it is <i>also indispensable to recognise in the composition of many other
oxides</i>. Thus it may be supposed that PbO<sub>2</sub> is a similar polymerised compound to
SiO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> that the composition of lead peroxide will be Pb<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>, because lead methyl,
PbMe<sub>4</sub>, and lead ethyl, PbEt<sub>4</sub>, are volatile compounds, whilst PbO<sub>2</sub> is non-volatile, and is
very like silica in this respect, and not in the least like carbonic anhydride. Still more
should a polymeric structure, Pb<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub><i>n</i></sub>, be ascribed to lead oxide, since it differs as little
from lead dioxide in its physical properties as carbonic oxide does from carbonic
anhydride, and being an unsaturated compound is more likely to be capable of intercombination
(polymerisation) than lead dioxide. These considerations respecting the
complexity of lead oxide could have no real significance, and could not be accepted, were
it not for the existence of the above-mentioned basic and mixed salts. The oxide apparently
corresponds with the composition Pb<sub><i>n</i></sub>X<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>, and since, according to this representation, the
number of X's in the salts of lead is considerable, it is obvious that they may be diverse.
When a part of these X's is replaced by the water residue (OH) or by oxygen, X<sub>2</sub> = O, and
the other parts by an <i>acid residue</i>, X, then basic salts are obtained, but if a part of the
X's is replaced by acid residues of one kind, and the other part by acid residues of another
kind, then those mixed salts about which we are now speaking are formed. Thus, for
example, we may suppose, for a comparison of the composition of the majority of the
salts of lead, that <i>n</i> = 12, and then the above-mentioned compounds will present themselves
in the following form:&mdash;Lead oxide, Pb<sub>12</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, its crystalline hydrate, Pb<sub>12</sub>O<sub>8</sub>(OH)<sub>8</sub>,
lead chloride, Pb<sub>12</sub>Cl<sub>24</sub>, lead oxychloride, Pb<sub>12</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, the other oxychloride, Pb<sub>12</sub>(OH)<sub>8</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,
mendipite (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_51_183">51</a>), Pb<sub>12</sub>Cl<sub>8</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, normal lead carbonate, Pb<sub>12</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>12</sub>, crystalline basic
salt, Pb<sub>12</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, white lead, Pb<sub>12</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>8</sub>(HO)<sub>8</sub>, corneous lead, Pb<sub>12</sub>Cl<sub>12</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>,
lanarkite, Pb<sub>12</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, leadhillite, Pb<sub>12</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>9</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. The number 12 is only
taken to avoid fractional quantities. Possibly the polymerisation is much higher than
this. The theory of the polymerisation of oxides introduced by me in the first edition of
this work (1869) is now beginning to be generally accepted.</p></div>

lead chloride. Its formation is expressed by the equation: 2PbX(OH),PbO + PbCl<sub>2</sub>
= 2Pb(OH)Cl,PbO + PbX<sub>2</sub>. Similar basic compounds of lead are met with in nature&mdash;for
instance, <i>mendipite</i>, PbCl,2PbO, which appears in brilliant yellowish-white

compounds of lead chloride, forming the <i>Cassel's</i>, or <i>mineral yellow</i> of the composition
PbCl<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>PbO. <i>Lead iodide</i>, PbI<sub>2</sub>, is still less soluble than the chloride, and is therefore
obtained by mixing potassium iodide with a solution of a lead salt. It separates as a

linseed oil is then added, and shaken up with it. A mixture of the oil and white lead is
then found to settle at the bottom of the vessel. Although the oil is much lighter than
the water it does not float on the top, but is retained by the white lead and sinks under
the water together with it. There is not, however, any more perfect combination nor
even any solution. If the resultant mass be then treated with ether or any other liquid
capable of dissolving the oil, the latter passes into solution and leaves the white lead
unaltered.</p></div>

acid, C(OH)<sub>4</sub>, in which three-quarters of the hydrogen is replaced by lead. A salt is also
known in which all the hydrogen of this hydrate of carbonic acid is replaced by lead&mdash;namely,
the salt containing CO<sub>4</sub>Pb<sub>2</sub>. This salt is obtained as a white crystalline substance
by the action of water and carbonic acid on lead. The normal salt, PbCO<sub>3</sub>, occurs
in nature under the name of white lead ore (sp. gr. 6·47), in crystals, isomorphous with
aragonite, and is formed by the double decomposition of lead nitrate with sodium carbonate,
as a heavy white precipitate. Thus both these salts resemble white lead, but
the first-named salt is exclusively used in practice, owing to its being very conveniently
prepared, and being characterised by its great covering capacity, or &lsquo;body,&rsquo; due to its
fine state of division.</p></div>

massicot with acetic acid or sugar of lead, and leaving the mixture exposed to air (and
re-mixing from time to time), containing carbonic acid, which is absorbed from the
surface by the basic salt formed. After repeated mixings (with the addition of water),
the entire mass is converted into white lead, which is thus obtained very finely divided.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_187" id="Footnote_54_187"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_187"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> If lead hydroxide be dissolved in potash and sodium hypochlorite be added to
the solution, the oxygen of the latter acts on the dissolved lead oxide, and partially
converts it into dioxide, so that the so-called lead sesquioxide is obtained; its empirical
formula is Pb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Probably it is nothing but a lead salt&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> is referable to the type of
dioxide of lead, or its hydroxide, PbO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, in which two atoms of hydrogen are replaced
by lead, PbO(O<sub>2</sub>Pb). The brown compound precipitated by the action of dilute acids&mdash;for
example, nitric&mdash;splits up, even at the ordinary temperature, into insoluble lead
dioxide and a solution of a lead salt. This compound evolves oxygen when it is heated.
It dissolves in hydrochloric acid, forming a yellow liquid, which probably contains compounds
of the composition PbCl<sub>2</sub> and PbCl<sub>4</sub>, but even at the ordinary temperature the
latter soon loses the excess of chlorine, and then only lead chloride, PbCl<sub>2</sub>, remains. In
order to see the relation between red lead and lead sesquioxide, it must be observed that
they only differ by an extra quantity of lead oxide&mdash;that is, red lead is a basic salt of the
preceding compound, and if the compound Pb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> may be regarded as PbO<sub>3</sub>Pb, then red
lead should be looked on as PbO<sub>3</sub>Pb,PbO&mdash;that is, as basic lead plumbate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_BIS_188" id="Footnote_54_BIS_188"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_BIS_188"><span class="label">[54 bis]</span></a> Frémy obtained potassium plumbate in the following manner. Pure lead dioxide
is placed in a silver crucible, and a strong solution of pure caustic potash is poured over
it. The mixture is heated and small quantities are removed from time to time for testing,
which consists in dissolving in a small quantity of water and decomposing the resultant
solution with nitric acid. There is a certain moment during the heating when a considerable
amount of insoluble lead dioxide is precipitated on the addition of the nitric acid;
the solution then contains the salt in question, and the heating must be stopped, and a
small amount of water added to dissolve the potassium plumbate formed. On cooling
the salt separates in somewhat large crystals, which have the same composition as the
stannate&mdash;that is, PbO(KO)<sub>2</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_189" id="Footnote_55_189"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_189"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Lead dioxide is often called lead peroxide, but this name leads to error, because
PbO<sub>2</sub> does not show the properties of true peroxides, like hydrogen or barium peroxides,
but is endowed with acid properties&mdash;that is, it is able to form true salts with bases,
which is not the case with true peroxides. Lead dioxide is a normal salt-forming compound
of lead, as Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is for bismuth, CeO<sub>2</sub> for cerium, and TeO<sub>3</sub> for tellurium, &amp;c. They all
evolve chlorine when treated with hydrochloric acid, whilst true peroxides form hydrogen
peroxide. The true lead peroxide, if it were obtained, would probably have the composition
Pb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, or, in combination with peroxide of hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + Pb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,
judging from the peroxides corresponding with sulphuric, chromic, and other acids, which
we shall afterwards consider.</p>

<p>As a proof of the fact, that the form PbO<sub>2</sub>, or PbX<sub>4</sub>, is the highest normal form of any
combination of lead, it is most important to remark that it might be expected that the
action of lead chloride, PbCl<sub>2</sub>, on zinc-ethyl, ZnEt<sub>2</sub>, would result in the formation of
zinc chloride, ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, and lead-ethyl, PbEt<sub>2</sub>, but that in reality the reaction proceeds otherwise.
Half of the lead is set free, and lead tetrethyl, PbEt<sub>4</sub>, is formed as a colourless
liquid, boiling at about 200° (Butleroff, Frankland, Buckton, Cahours, and others). The
type PbX<sub>4</sub> is not only expressed in PbEt<sub>4</sub> and PbO<sub>2</sub>, but also in PbF<sub>4</sub>, obtained by
Brauner.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_190" id="Footnote_56_190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_190"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> According to Carnelley and Walker, the hydrate (PbO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O is then formed; it
loses water at 230°. The anhydrous dioxide remains unchanged up to 280°, and is then
converted into the sesquioxide, Pb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which again loses oxygen at about 400°, and forms
red lead, Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Red lead also loses oxygen at about 550°, forming lead oxide, PbO,
which fuses without change at about 600°, and remains constant as far as the limit of
the observations made (about 800°).</p>

<p>The best method for preparing pure lead dioxide consists in mixing a hot solution of
lead chloride with a solution of bleaching powder (Fehrman).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_192" id="Footnote_57_192"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_192"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> The compounds of titanium are generally obtained from rutile; the finely-ground
ore is fused with a considerable amount of acid potassium sulphate, until the titanic
anhydride, as a feeble base, passes into solution. After cooling, the resultant mass is
ground up, dissolved in cold water, and treated with ammonium hydrosulphide; a black
precipitate then separates out from the solution. This precipitate contains TiO<sub>2</sub> (as
hydrate) and various metallic sulphides&mdash;for example, iron sulphide. It is first washed
with water and then with a solution of sulphurous anhydride until it becomes colourless.
This is due to the iron sulphide contained in the precipitate, and rendering it black, being
converted into dithionate by the action of the sulphurous acid. The titanic acid left behind
is nearly pure. The considerable volatility of titanium chloride may also be taken advantage
of in preparing the compounds of titanium from rutile. It is formed by heating a
mixture of rutile and charcoal in dry chlorine; the distillate then contains <i>titanium chloride</i>,
TiCl<sub>4</sub>. It may be easily purified, owing to its having a constant boiling point of 136°.
Its specific gravity is 1·76; it is a colourless liquid, which fumes in the air, and is perfectly
soluble in water if it be not heated. When hot water acts on titanic chloride, a large
proportion of titanic acid separates out from the solution and passes into metatitanic acid.
A similar decomposition of acid solutions of titanic acid is accomplished whenever they
are heated, and especially in the presence of sulphuric acid, just as with metastannic
acid, which titanic acid resembles in many respects. On igniting the titanic acid a
colourless powder of the anhydride, TiO<sub>2</sub>, is obtained. In this form it is no longer soluble
in acids or alkalis, and only fuses in the oxyhydrogen flame; but, like silica, it dissolves
when fused with alkalis and their carbonates; as already mentioned, it dissolves when
fused with a considerable excess of acid potassium sulphate&mdash;that is, it then reacts as a
feeble base. This shows the basic character of titanic anhydride; it has at once, although
feebly developed, both basic and acid properties. The fused mass, obtained from titanic
anhydride and alkali when treated with water, parts with its alkali, and a residue is obtained
of a sparingly-soluble poly-titanate, K<sub>2</sub>TiO<sub>3</sub><i>n</i>TiO<sub>2</sub>. The hydrate, which is precipitated by
ammonia from the solutions obtained by the fusion of TiO<sub>2</sub> with acid potassium sulphate,
when dried forms an amorphous mass of the composition Ti(OH)<sub>4</sub>. But it loses water over
sulphuric acid, gradually passing into a hydrate of the composition TiO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and when
heated it parts with a still larger proportion of water; at 100° the hydrate Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> is
obtained, and at 300° the anhydride itself. The higher hydrate, Ti(OH)<sub>4</sub>, is soluble in
dilute acid, and the solution may be diluted with water; but on boiling the sulphuric acid
solution (though not the solution in hydrochloric acid), all the titanic acid separates in
a modified form, which is, however, not only insoluble in dilute acids, but even in strong
sulphuric acid. This hydrate has the composition Ti<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, but shows different properties
from those of the hydrate of the same composition described above, and therefore
this modified hydrate is called <i>metatitanic acid</i>. It is most important to note the
property of the ordinary gelatinous hydrate (that precipitated from acid solutions by
ammonia) of dissolving in acids, the more so since silica does not show this property.
In this property a transition apparently appears between the cases of common solution
(based on a capacity for unstable combination) and the case of the formation of a
hydrosol (the solubility of germanium oxide, GeO<sub>2</sub>, perhaps presents another such
instance). If titanium chloride be added drop by drop to a dilute solution of alcohol
and hydrogen peroxide, and then ammonia be added to the resultant solution, a yellow
precipitate of <i>titanium trioxide</i>, TiO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, separates out, as Piccini, Weller, and Classen
showed. This substance apparently belongs to the category of true peroxides.</p>

<p>Titanium chloride absorbs ammonia and forms a compound, TiCl<sub>4</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>, as a red-brown
powder which attracts moisture from the air and when ignited forms <i>titanium
nitride</i>, Ti<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>. Phosphuretted hydrogen, hydrocyanic acid, and many similar compounds
are also absorbed by titanium chloride, with the evolution of a considerable amount of
heat. Thus, for example, a yellow crystalline powder of the composition TiCl<sub>4</sub>,2HCN
is obtained by passing dry hydrocyanic acid vapour into cold titanium chloride.
Titanium chloride combines in a similar manner with cyanogen chloride, phosphorus
pentachloride, and phosphorus oxychloride, forming molecular compounds, for example
TiCl<sub>4</sub>,POCl<sub>3</sub>. This faculty for further combination probably stands in connection, on
the one hand, with the capacity of titanium oxide to give polytitanates, TiO(MO)<sub>2</sub>,<i>n</i>TiO<sub>2</sub>;
on the other hand, it corresponds with the kindred faculty of stannic chloride for the
formation of poly-compounds (Note <a href="#Footnote_41_171">41</a>), and lastly it is probably related to the remarkable
behaviour of titanium towards nitrogen. Metallic titanium, obtained as a grey
powder by reducing potassium titanofluoride, K<sub>2</sub>TiF<sub>6</sub>, (sp. gr. 3·55 K. Hofman 1893), with
iron in a charcoal crucible, combines directly with nitrogen at a red heat. If titanic
anhydride be ignited in a stream of ammonia, all the oxygen of the titanic oxide is
disengaged, and the compound TiN<sub>2</sub> is formed as a dark violet substance having a copper-red
lustre. A compound Ti<sub>5</sub>N<sub>6</sub> is also known; it is obtained by igniting the compound
Ti<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> in a stream of hydrogen, and is of a golden-yellow colour with a metallic lustre.
To this order of compounds also belongs the well-known and chemically historical
compound known as <i>titanium nitrocyanide</i>; its composition is Ti<sub>5</sub>CN<sub>4</sub>. This substance
appears as infusible, sometimes well-formed, cubical crystals of sp. gr, 4·3, and having a
red copper colour and metallic lustre; it is found in blast furnace slag. It is insoluble
in acids but is acted on by chlorine at a red heat, forming titanium chloride. It was at
first regarded as metallic titanium; it is formed in the blast furnace at the expense of
those cyanogen compounds (potassium cyanide and others) which are always present,
and at the expense of the titanium compounds which accompany the ores of iron.
Wöhler, who investigated this compound, obtained it artificially by heating a mixture of
titanic oxide with a small quantity of charcoal, in a stream of nitrogen, and thus
proved the direct power for combination between nitrogen and titanium. When fused
with caustic potash, all the nitrogen compounds of titanium evolve ammonia and form
potassium titanate. Like metals they are able to reduce many oxides&mdash;for example,
oxides of copper&mdash;at a red heat. Among the alloys of titanium, the crystalline compound
Al<sub>4</sub>Ti is remarkable. It is obtained by directly dissolving titanium in fused aluminium;
its specific gravity is 3·11. The crystals are very stable, and are only soluble in aqua
regia and alkalis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_193" id="Footnote_58_193"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_193"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> The formula ZrO was first given to the oxide of zirconium as a base, in this case
Zr = 45 whilst the present atomic weight is Zr = 90&mdash;that is, the formula of the oxide is
now recognised as being ZrO<sub>2</sub>. The reasons for ascribing this formula to the compounds
of zirconium are as follows. In the first place, the investigation of the crystalline forms
of the zirconofluorides&mdash;for example, K<sub>2</sub>ZrF<sub>6</sub>, MgZrF<sub>6</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;which proved to be
analogous in composition and crystalline form with the corresponding compounds of
titanium, tin, and silicon. In the second place, the specific heat of Zr is 0·067, which
corresponds with the combining weight 90. The third and most important reason for
doubling the combining weight of zirconium was given by Deville's determination of the
vapour density of <i>zirconium chloride</i>, ZrCl<sub>4</sub>. This substance is obtained by igniting
zirconium oxide mixed with charcoal in a stream of dry chlorine, and is a colourless,
saline substance which is easily volatile at 440°. Its density referred to air was found to
be 8·15, that is 117 in relation to hydrogen, as it should be according to the molecular
formula of this substance above-cited. It exhibits, however, in many respects, a saline
character and that of an acid chloranhydride, for zirconium oxide itself presents very
feebly developed acid properties but clearly marked basic properties. Thus zirconium
chloride dissolves in water, and on evaporation the solution only partially disengages
hydrochloric acid&mdash;resembling magnesium chloride, for example. Zirconium was discovered
and characterised as an individual element by Klaproth.</p>

<p>Pure compounds of zirconium are generally prepared from zircon, which is finely
ground, but as it is very hard it is first heated and thrown into cold water, by which
means it is disintegrated. Zircon is decomposed or dissolved when fused with acid
potassium sulphate, or still more easily when fused with acid potassium fluoride
(a double soluble salt, K<sub>2</sub>ZrF<sub>6</sub>, is then formed); however, zirconium compounds are
generally prepared from powdered zircon by fusing it with sodium carbonate
and then boiling in water. An insoluble white residue is obtained consisting of a
compound of the oxides of sodium and zirconium, which is then treated with hydrochloric
acid and the solution evaporated to dryness. The silica is thus converted
into an insoluble form, and zirconium chloride obtained in solution. Ammonia precipitates
<i>zirconium hydroxide</i> from this solution, as a white gelatinous precipitate,
ZrO(OH)<sub>2</sub>. When ignited this hydroxide loses water and in so doing undergoes a spontaneous
recalescence and leaves a white infusible and exceedingly hard mass of <i>zirconium
oxide</i>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, having a specific gravity of 5·4 (in the electrical furnace ZrO<sub>2</sub> fuses and
volatilises like SiO<sub>2</sub>, Moissan). Owing to its infusibility, zirconium oxide is used as a
substitute for lime and magnesia in the Drummond light. This oxide, in contradistinction
to titanium oxide, is soluble, even after prolonged ignition, in hot strong sulphuric
acid. The hydroxide is easily soluble in acids. The composition of the salts is ZrX<sub>4</sub>, or
ZrOX<sub>2</sub>, or ZrOX<sub>2</sub>,ZrO<sub>2</sub>, just as with those of its analogues. But although zirconium
oxide forms salts in the same way with acids, it also gives salts with bases. Thus it
liberates carbonic anhydride when fused with sodium carbonate, forming the salts
Zr(NaO)<sub>4</sub>, ZrO(NaO)<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. Water, however, destroys these salts and extracts the soda.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_194" id="Footnote_59_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_194"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Thorium has also been found in the form of oxide in certain pyrochlores, euxenites,
monazites, and other rare minerals containing salts of niobium and phosphates. The
compounds of thorium are prepared by decomposing thorite or orangeite with strong
sulphuric acid at its boiling point; this renders the silica insoluble, and the thorium
oxide passes into solution when the residue is treated with cold water, after having been
previously boiled with water (boiling water does not dissolve the oxide of thorium).
Lead and other impurities are separated by passing sulphuretted hydrogen through the
solution, and the thorium hydroxide is then precipitated by ammonia. If this hydroxide
be dissolved in the smallest possible amount of hydrochloric acid, and oxalic acid be then
added, thorium oxalate is obtained as a white precipitate, which is insoluble in an excess
of oxalic acid; this reaction is taken advantage of for separating this metal from many
others. It, however, resembles the cerite metals (Chapter XVII., Note <a href="#Footnote_43_120">43</a>) in this and
many other respects. The thorium hydroxide is gelatinous; on ignition it leaves an
infusible oxide, ThO<sub>2</sub>, which, when fused with borax, gives crystals of the same form as
stannic oxide or titanic anhydride; sp. gr. 9·86. But the basic properties are much more
developed in thorium oxide than in the preceding oxides, and it does not even disengage
carbonic acid when fused with sodium carbonate&mdash;that is, it is a much more energetic
base than zirconium oxide. The hydrate, ThO<sub>2</sub>, however, is soluble in a solution of
Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (Chapter XVII., Note <a href="#Footnote_43_120">43</a>). Thorium chloride, ThCl<sub>4</sub> is obtained as a distinctly
crystalline sublimate when thorium oxide, mixed with charcoal, is ignited in a stream of
dry chlorine. When heated with potassium, thorium chloride gives a metallic powder of
thorium having a sp. gr. 11·1. It burns in air, and is but slightly soluble in dilute acids.
The atomic weight of thorium was established by Chydenius and Delafontaine on the
basis of the ismorphism of the double fluorides.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">PHOSPHORUS AND THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE FIFTH GROUP</span></h2>

<p>Nitrogen is the lightest and most widely distributed representative of
the elements of the fifth group, which form a higher saline oxide of the
form R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and a hydrogen compound of the form RH<sub>3</sub>. Phosphorus,
arsenic, bismuth, and antimony belong to the uneven series of this
group. <i>Phosphorus</i> is the most widely distributed of these elements.
There is hardly any mineral substance composing the mass of the
earth's crust which does not contain some&mdash;it may be a small&mdash;amount
of phosphorus compounds in the form of the salts of phosphoric acid.
The soil and earthy substances in general usually contain from one to
ten parts of phosphoric acid in 10,000 parts. This amount, which
appears so small, has, however, a very important significance in nature.
No plant can attain its natural growth if it be planted in an artificial
soil completely free from phosphoric acid. Plants equally require the
presence of potash, magnesia, lime, and ferric oxide, among basic, and
of carbonic, sulphuric, nitric, and phosphoric anhydrides, among acid
oxides. In order to increase the fertility of a more or less poor soil,
the above-named nutritive elements are introduced into it by means of
fertilisers. Direct experiment has proved that these substances are
undoubtedly necessary to plants, but that they must be all present
simultaneously and in small quantities, and that an excess, like an
insufficiency, of one of these elements is necessarily followed by a bad
harvest, or an imperfect growth, even if all the other conditions (light,
heat, water, air) are normal. The phosphoric compounds of the soil
accumulated by plants pass into the organism of animals, in which
these substances are assimilated in many instances in large quantities.
Thus the chief component part of bones is calcium phosphate, Ca<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,
and it is on this that their hardness depends.<a name="FNanchor_1_195" id="FNanchor_1_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_195" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Phosphorus was first extracted by Brand in 1669, by the ignition
of evaporated urine. After the lapse of a century Scheele, who knew
of the existence of a more abundant source of phosphorus in bones,
pointed out the method which is now employed for the extraction of
this element. Calcium phosphate in bones permeates a nitrogenous
organic substance, which is called ossein, and forms a gelatin.
When bones are treated exclusively for the extraction of phosphorus,
neglecting the gelatin, they are burnt, in which case all the ossein is
burnt away. When, however, it is desired to preserve the gelatin, the
bones are immersed in cold dilute hydrochloric acid, which dissolves
the calcium phosphate and leaves the gelatin untouched; calcium
chloride and acid calcium phosphate, CaH<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, are then obtained in
the solution. When the bones are directly burnt in an open fire their
mineral components only are left as an ash, containing about 90 per
cent. of calcium phosphate, Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, mixed with a small amount of
calcium carbonate and other salts. This mass is treated with sulphuric
acid, and then the same substance is obtained in the solution as was
obtained from the unburnt bones immersed in hydrochloric acid&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the
acid calcium phosphate soluble in water, in which reaction naturally
the chief part of the sulphuric acid is converted into calcium sulphate:</p>

<p class="title">Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = 2CaSO<sub>4</sub> + CaH<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.<br />
Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 4HCl         = 2CaCl<sub>2</sub> + CaH<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>On evaporating the solution, crystallisable acid calcium phosphate
is obtained. The extraction of the phosphorus from this salt consists
in <i>heating it with charcoal to a white heat</i>. When heated, the
acid phosphate, CaH<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, first parts with water, and forms the
metaphosphate, Ca(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, which for the sake of simplicity may be
regarded, like the acid salt, as composed of pyrophosphate and phosphoric
anhydride, 2Ca(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = Ca<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The latter, with
charcoal, gives phosphorus and carbonic oxide, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 5C = P<sub>2</sub> + 5CO.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
So that in reality a somewhat complicated process takes place here,
yielding ultimately products according to the following equation:</p>

<p class="title">2CaH<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 5C = 4H<sub>2</sub>O + Ca<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + P<sub>2</sub> + 5CO.</p>

<p>After the steam has come over, phosphorus and carbonic oxide distil
over from the retort and calcium pyrophosphate remains behind.<a name="FNanchor_1_BIS_196" id="FNanchor_1_BIS_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_BIS_196" class="fnanchor">[1 bis]</a></p>

<p>As phosphorus melts at about 40°, it condenses at the bottom of
the receiver in a molten liquid mass, which is cast under water in
tubes, and is sold in the form of sticks. This is common or <i>yellow
phosphorus</i>. It is a transparent, yellowish, waxy substance, which is
not brittle, almost insoluble in water, and easily undergoes change in
its external appearance and properties under the action of light, heat,
and of various substances. It crystallises (by sublimation or from its
solution in carbon bisulphide) in the regular system, and<a name="FNanchor_2_197" id="FNanchor_2_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_197" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (in contradistinction
to the other varieties) is easily soluble in carbon bisulphide,
and also partially in other oily liquids. In this it recalls common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sulphur. Its specific gravity is 1·84. It fuses at 44°, and passes into
vapour at 290°; it is easily inflammable, and must therefore be
handled with great caution; careless rubbing is enough to cause phosphorus
to ignite. Its application in the manufacture of matches is
based on this.<a name="FNanchor_2_BIS_198" id="FNanchor_2_BIS_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_BIS_198" class="fnanchor">[2 bis]</a> It emits light in the air owing to its slow<a name="FNanchor_3_199" id="FNanchor_3_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_199" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> oxidation,
and is therefore kept under water (such water is phosphorescent
in the dark, like phosphorus itself). It is also very easily oxidised by
various oxidising agents and takes up the oxygen from many substances.<a name="FNanchor_3_BIS_200" id="FNanchor_3_BIS_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_BIS_200" class="fnanchor">[3 bis]</a>
Phosphorus enters into direct combination with many
metals and with sulphur, chlorine, &amp;c., with development of a considerable
amount of heat. It is very poisonous although not soluble in
water.</p>

<p>Besides this, there is a red variety of phosphorus, which differs considerably
from the above. <i>Red phosphorus</i> (sometimes wrongly called
<i>amorphous phosphorus</i>) is partially formed when ordinary phosphorus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
remains exposed to the action of light for a long time. It is also
formed in many reactions; for example, when ordinary phosphorus
combines with chlorine, bromine, iodine, or oxygen, a portion of it is
converted into red phosphorus. Schrötter, in Vienna, investigated this
variety of phosphorus, and pointed out by what methods it may be
produced in considerable quantities. Red phosphorus is a powdery red-brown
opaque substance of specific gravity 2·14. It does not combine
so energetically with oxygen and other substances as yellow phosphorus,
and evolves less heat in combining with them.<a name="FNanchor_4_201" id="FNanchor_4_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_201" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Common phosphorus
easily oxidises in the air; red phosphorus does not oxidise at all at the
ordinary temperature; hence it does not phosphoresce in the air, and
may be very conveniently kept in the form of powder. It does not, like
yellow phosphorus, fuse at 44°. After being converted into vapour at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
290° or 300°, it again passes into the ordinary variety when slowly
cooled. Red phosphorus is not soluble in carbon bisulphide and other
oily liquids, which permits of its being freed from any admixture of the
ordinary phosphorus. It is not poisonous, and is used in many cases for
which the ordinary phosphorus is unsuitable or dangerous; for example,
in the manufacture of matches, which are then not poisonous or inflammable
by accidental friction, and therefore the red variety has now
replaced the ordinary phosphorus.<a name="FNanchor_4_BIS_202" id="FNanchor_4_BIS_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_BIS_202" class="fnanchor">[4 bis]</a></p>

<p>The heads of the &lsquo;safety&rsquo; matches do not contain any phosphorus,
but only substances capable of burning and of supporting combustion.
Red phosphorus is spread over a surface on the box, and it
is the friction against this phosphorus which ignites the matches.
There is no danger of the matches taking fire accidentally, nor are
they poisonous.<a name="FNanchor_5_203" id="FNanchor_5_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_203" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This red phosphorus is prepared by heating the
ordinary phosphorus at 230° to 270°; it is evident that this must
be done in an atmosphere incapable of supporting combustion&mdash;for
example, in nitrogen, carbonic anhydride, steam, &amp;c. On a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
large scale, ordinary phosphorus is placed in closed iron vessels,<a name="FNanchor_5_BIS_204" id="FNanchor_5_BIS_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_BIS_204" class="fnanchor">[5 bis]</a> and
immersed in a bath of different proportions of tin and lead, by which
means the temperature of 250° necessary for the conversion is easily
attained. It is kept at this temperature for some time. The temperature
is at first cautiously raised, and the air is thus partially expelled
by the heat, and also by the evolution of steam (the phosphorus is
damp when put in), whilst the remaining oxygen is also partially
absorbed by the phosphorus, so that an atmosphere of nitrogen is
produced in the iron vessel. Red phosphorus enters into all the
reactions proper to yellow phosphorus, only with greater difficulty
and more slowly;<a name="FNanchor_6_205" id="FNanchor_6_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_205" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and, as its vapour tension (volatility) is less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
that of the yellow variety, it may be supposed that a polymerisation
takes place in the passage of the yellow into the red modification, just as
in the passage of cyanogen into paracyanogen, or of cyanic acid into
cyanuric acid (Chapter IX. Notes <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_39_BIS_555">39 bis</a> and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_48_565">48</a>).</p>

<p>The vapour of phosphorus is colourless; its density remains constant
between 300° and 1000° (Dumas, 1833; Mitscherlich, Deville, and
Troost, 1859, and others). The density with respect to air has been
determined as from 4·3 to 4·5. Hence, referred to hydrogen, it is
4·4 × 14·4 = 63, corresponding with a molecular weight 124, <i>i.e.</i> the
molecule of phosphorus in a state of vapour contains P<sub>4</sub>. The reader
will remember that the molecule of nitrogen contains N<sub>2</sub>, of sulphur S<sub>6</sub>
or S<sub>2</sub>, and of oxygen O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The chemical energy of phosphorus in a free state more nearly
approaches that of sulphur than nitrogen. Phosphorus is combustible and
inflames at 60°; but having in the act of combination parted with a portion
of its energy in the form of heat it becomes analogous to nitrogen,
so long as there is no question of its reduction back again into phosphorus.
Nitric acid is easily reduced to nitrogen, whilst phosphoric
acid is reduced with very much greater difficulty. All the compounds of
phosphorus are less volatile than those of nitrogen. Nitric acid, HNO<sub>3</sub>,
is easily distilled; metaphosphoric acid, HPO<sub>3</sub>, is generally said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
non-volatile; triethylamine, N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, boils at 90°, and triethylphosphine,
P(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, at 127°.</p>

<p>Phosphorus not only combines easily and directly with oxygen, but
also with chlorine, bromine, iodine, sulphur, and with certain metals,
and red phosphorus when heated combines with hydrogen also.<a name="FNanchor_6_BIS_206" id="FNanchor_6_BIS_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_BIS_206" class="fnanchor">[6 bis]</a> So, for
instance, when fused with sodium under naphtha, phosphorus gives the
compound Na<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>. Zinc, absorbing the vapour of phosphorus, gives the
phosphide Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub> (sp. gr. 4·76); tin, SnP; copper, Cu<sub>2</sub>P; even platinum
combines with phosphorus (PtP<sub>2</sub>, sp. gr. 8·77).<a name="FNanchor_6_TRI_207" id="FNanchor_6_TRI_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_TRI_207" class="fnanchor">[6 tri]</a> Iron, when combined
even with a small quantity of phosphorus, becomes brittle.<a name="FNanchor_7_208" id="FNanchor_7_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_208" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Some of
these compounds of phosphorus are obtained by the action of phosphorus
on the solutions of metallic salts, and by the ignition of metallic
oxides in the vapour of phosphorus, or by heating mixtures of phosphates
with charcoal and metals. Phosphides do not exhibit the
external properties of salts, which are so clearly seen in the chlorides
and still distinctly observable in the sulphides. <i>The phosphides of the
metals</i> of the alkalis and of the alkaline earths are even immediately
and very easily decomposed by water, whereas this is found to be the
case with only a very few sulphides, and still more rarely and indistinctly
with the chlorides. We may take calcium phosphide as an example.<a name="FNanchor_7_BIS_209" id="FNanchor_7_BIS_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_209" class="fnanchor">[7 bis]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Phosphorus is laid in a deep crucible, and covered with a clay plug,
over which lime is strewn. At a red heat the vapours of phosphorus
combine with the oxygen of the lime and form phosphoric anhydride,
which forms a salt with another portion of the lime, whilst the
liberated calcium combines with the phosphorus and forms calcium
phosphide. Its composition is not quite certain; it may be CaP
(corresponding with liquid phosphuretted hydrogen). This substance
is remarkable for the following reaction: if we take water&mdash;or, better
still, a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid&mdash;and throw calcium phosphide
into it, bubbles of gas are evolved, which take fire spontaneously
in the air and form white rings. This is owing to the fact
that the liquid hydrogen phosphide, PH<sub>2</sub>, is first formed, thus,
CaP + 2HCl = CaCl<sub>2</sub> + PH<sub>2</sub>, which, owing to its instability, very
easily splits up into the solid phosphide, P<sub>2</sub>H, and gaseous phosphide,
PH<sub>3</sub>; 5PH<sub>2</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>H + 3PH<sub>3</sub>; the latter corresponds with ammonia.
The mixture of the gaseous and liquid phosphides takes fire spontaneously
in the air, forming phosphoric acid. The same hydrogen
phosphides are formed when water acts on sodium phosphide (P<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>3</sub>).
A similar mixture of gaseous liquid and solid phosphuretted hydrogen
(Retgers 1894) is formed by heating (in a glass tube) red phosphorus
in a stream of dry hydrogen. Hence we see that there are <i>three compounds
of phosphorus with hydrogen</i>. (1) The first or solid yellow
phosphide, P<sub>2</sub>H (more probably P<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), is obtained by the action of
strong hydrochloric acid on sodium phosphide; it takes fire when
struck or at 175°. (2) The liquid, PH<sub>2</sub>, or more correctly expressed as
the molecule, P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, is a colourless liquid which takes fire spontaneously
in the air, boils at 30°, is very unstable, and is easily decomposed (by
light or hydrochloric acid) into the two other phosphides of hydrogen.
It is prepared by passing the gases evolved by the action of water
on calcium phosphide through a freezing mixture.<a name="FNanchor_8_210" id="FNanchor_8_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_210" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> And, lastly, (3),
gaseous hydrogen phosphide, <i>phosphine</i>, PH<sub>3</sub>, which is distinguished as
being the most stable. It is a colourless gas, which does not take fire
in the air. It has an odour of garlic, and is very poisonous. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
resembles ammonia in many of its properties.<a name="FNanchor_8_BIS_211" id="FNanchor_8_BIS_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_BIS_211" class="fnanchor">[8 bis]</a> It is easily decomposed
by heat, like ammonia, forming phosphorus and hydrogen; but
it is very slightly soluble in water, and does not saturate acids,
although it forms compounds with some of them which resemble
ammonium salts in their form and properties. Among them the <i>compound
with hydriodic acid</i>, PH<sub>4</sub>I, analogous to ammonium iodide, is
remarkable. This compound crystallises on sublimation in well-formed
cubes, like sal-ammoniac, which it resembles in many respects. However,
this compound does not enter into those reactions of double
decomposition which are proper to sal-ammoniac, because its saline
properties are very feebly developed. Phosphuretted hydrogen also
combines, like ammonia, with certain chloranhydrides; but they are
decomposed by water, with the evolution of phosphine. Ogier (1880)
showed that hydrochloric acid also combines with phosphine under a
pressure of 20 atmospheres at +18°, and under the ordinary pressure
at -35°, forming the crystalline phosphonium chloride PH<sub>4</sub>Cl, corresponding
to sal-ammoniac. Hydrobromic acid does the same with greater
ease, and hydriodic acid with still greater facility, forming phosphonium
iodide, PH<sub>4</sub>I.<a name="FNanchor_9_212" id="FNanchor_9_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_212" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Phosphuretted hydrogen, or phosphine</i>, PH<sub>3</sub>, is generally prepared by
the action of caustic potash on phosphorus.<a name="FNanchor_10_213" id="FNanchor_10_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_213" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Small pieces of phosphorus
are dropped into a flask containing a strong solution of caustic
potash and heated. Potassium hypophosphite, H<sub>2</sub>KPO<sub>2</sub>, is then obtained
in solution; gaseous phosphuretted hydrogen is evolved:</p>

<p class="title">P<sub>4</sub> + 3KHO + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 3(KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>) + PH<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Liquid phosphuretted hydrogen (and free hydrogen) is also formed,
together with the phosphine, so that the gaseous product, on escaping
from the water into the air, takes fire spontaneously, forming beautiful
white rings of phosphoric acid. In this experiment, as in that with
calcium phosphide, it is the liquid, P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, that takes fire; but the
phosphine set light to by it also burns, PH<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>4</sub> = PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. The same
phosphuretted hydrogen, PH<sub>3</sub>, may be obtained pure, and not spontaneously
combustible, by igniting the hydrates of phosphorous acid
(4PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = PH<sub>3</sub> + 3PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and hypophosphorous acid (2PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
= PH<sub>3</sub> + PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>); or, more simply, by the decomposition of calcium
phosphide by hydrochloric acid, because then all the liquid phosphide,
P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, is decomposed into non-volatile P<sub>2</sub>H and gaseous PH<sub>3</sub>. Pure
phosphine liquefies when cooled to -90°, boils at -85°, and solidifies
at -135° (Olszewski). When phosphorus burns in an excess<a name="FNanchor_10_BIS_214" id="FNanchor_10_BIS_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_BIS_214" class="fnanchor">[10 bis]</a> of <i>dry</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
oxygen, then only <i>phosphoric anhydride</i>, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is formed. It is
prepared by dropping pieces of phosphorus through a wide tube, fixed
into the upper neck of a large glass globe, on to a cup suspended in the
centre of the globe. These lumps are set alight by touching them with
a hot wire, and the phosphorus burns into P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The dry air necessary
for its combustion is forced into the globe through a lateral neck, and
the white flakes of phosphoric anhydride formed are carried by the
current of air through a second lateral neck into a series of Woulfe's
bottles, where they settle as friable white flakes. Phosphoric anhydride
may also be formed by passing dry air through a solution of phosphorus
in carbon bisulphide. All the materials for the preparation of this substance
must be carefully dried, because it <i>combines</i> with great eagerness
<i>with water</i>, at the same time developing a large amount of heat and
forming metaphosphoric acid, HPO<sub>3</sub>, from which the water cannot
be separated by heat. Phosphoric anhydride is a colourless snow-like
substance, which attracts moisture from the air with the utmost avidity.
It fuses at a red heat, and then <i>volatilises</i>. Its affinity for water is so
great that it takes it up from many substances. Thus it converts sulphuric
acid into sulphuric anhydride, and carbohydrates (wood, paper)
are carbonised, and give up the elements of water when brought into
contact with it.</p>

<p>When moist phosphorus slowly oxidises in the air, it not only
forms phosphorous and phosphoric acids, but also <i>hypophosphoric acid</i>,
H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, which when in a dry state easily splits up at 60° into phosphorous
and metaphosphoric acids (H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> = H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> + HPO<sub>3</sub>), but
differs from a mixture of these acids in that it forms well-characterised
salts, of which the sodium salt, H<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, is but slightly soluble in
water (the sodium salts of phosphoric and phosphorous acids are easily
soluble), and that it does not act as a reducing agent, like mixtures
containing phosphorous acid.<a name="FNanchor_11_215" id="FNanchor_11_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_215" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Judging by the general law of the formation of acids (Chapter <a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>),
the series of phosphorus compounds should include the following <i>ortho-acids</i>
and their corresponding anhydrides, answering to phosphuretted
hydrogen, H<sub>3</sub>P:&mdash;</p>

<p>The last of these (the analogue of N<sub>2</sub>O) is almost unknown. Phosphoric
anhydride (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) with a small quantity of water does not at first
give orthophosphoric acid, PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, but a compound P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, or
PHO<sub>3</sub>, whose composition corresponds with that of nitric acid; this is
<i>metaphosphoric acid</i>. Even with an excess of water, combining with
phosphoric anhydride, this metaphosphoric acid, and not the ortho-,
passes at first into solution. Metaphosphoric acid in solution only
passes into orthophosphoric acid when the solution is heated or after
a lapse of time.</p>

<p><i>Orthophosphoric acid</i><a name="FNanchor_13_217" id="FNanchor_13_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_217" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> is obtained by oxidising phosphorus with
nitric acid until the phosphorus entirely passes into solution and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
lower oxides of nitrogen cease to be evolved. The reaction takes place
best with dilute nitric acid, and when aided by heat. The resultant
solution is evaporated to a syrup. If a weighed quantity of phosphorus
(dried in a current of dry carbonic anhydride) be taken, a crystalline
mass of the acid can be obtained by evaporating the solution until it consists
only of the quantity<a name="FNanchor_14_218" id="FNanchor_14_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_218" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of phosphoric acid corresponding with the
amount of phosphorus taken (from 31 parts of P, 98 parts of solution).
The acid fuses at +39°; specific gravity of the liquid 1·88. Phosphorus
pentachloride, PCl<sub>5</sub>, and oxychloride, POCl<sub>3</sub> (see further on), give
orthophosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid with water. The two other
varieties of phosphoric acid, with which we shall presently become
acquainted, give the same ortho-acid when under the influence of acids,
with particular ease when boiled and more slowly in the cold. By
itself orthophosphoric acid (either in solution or when dry) does not
pass into the other varieties; it does not oxidise, and therefore presents
the limiting and stable form. When heated to 300°, it loses water and
passes into pyrophosphoric acid, 2H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, whilst at a
red heat it loses twice as much water and is converted into metaphosphoric
acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O + HPO<sub>3</sub>. In aqueous solution orthophosphoric
acid differs clearly from pyro- or metaphosphoric acids, because
the solutions of these latter acids give different reactions: thus orthophosphoric
acid does not precipitate albumin, does not give a precipitate
with barium chloride, and forms a yellow precipitate of silver orthophosphate,
Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, with silver nitrate (in the presence of alkalis, but
not otherwise); whilst a solution of pyrophosphoric acid, H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,
although it does not precipitate albumin or barium chloride, gives
a white precipitate of silver pyrophosphate, Ag<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, with silver
nitrate; and a solution of metaphosphoric acid, HPO<sub>3</sub>, precipitates
both albumin and barium chloride, and gives a white precipitate of
silver metaphosphate, AgPO<sub>3</sub>, with silver nitrate. These points of
distinction were studied by Graham, and are exceedingly instructive.
They show that the solution of a substance does not determine
the maximum of chemical combination with water, that solutions may
contain various degrees of combination with water, and that there is
a clear difference between the water serving for solution and that
entering into chemical combination. Graham's experiments also
showed that the water whose removal or combination determines the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
conversion of ortho- into meta- and pyrophosphoric acids differs distinctly
from water of crystallisation, for he obtained the salts of ortho-,
meta-, and pyrophosphoric acids with water of crystallisation, and they
differed in their reactions, like the acids themselves. This water of
crystallisation was expelled with greater ease than the water of constitution
of the hydrates in question.<a name="FNanchor_14_BIS_219" id="FNanchor_14_BIS_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_BIS_219" class="fnanchor">[14 bis]</a></p>

<p>Orthophosphoric acid has a pleasant acid taste and a distinctly acid
reaction; it is used as a medicine, and is not poisonous (phosphorous
acid is poisonous). Alkalis, like sodium, potassium, and ammonium
hydroxides, saturate the acid properties of phosphoric acid when taken
in the ratio 2NaHO : H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;that is, when salts of the composition
HNa<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> are formed. When taken in the ratio NaHO : H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, a
solution having an acid reaction is obtained, and when 3NaHO : H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;that
is, when the salt Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> is formed&mdash;an alkaline reaction is
obtained. Hence many chemists (Berzelius) even regarded the salts
of composition R<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> as normal, and considered phosphoric acid
to be bibasic. But the salt Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> also shows a feeble alkaline
reaction, so that it is impossible to judge the characteristic peculiarities
of acids by the reactions on litmus paper, as we already know from
many examples. Orthophosphoric acid is tribasic, because it contains
three equivalents of hydrogen replaceable by metals, forming salts,
such as NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, and Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. It is also tribasic, because
with silver nitrate its soluble salts always give Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_15_220" id="FNanchor_15_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_220" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> a salt with
three equivalents of silver, and because by double decomposition with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
barium chloride it forms a salt of the composition Ba<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and
silver and barium hardly ever give basic salts. With the metals
of the alkalis, phosphoric acid forms soluble salts, but the normal
salts of the metals of the alkaline earths, R<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and even
R<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>), are insoluble in water, but dissolve in feeble acids, such
as phosphoric and acetic, because they then form soluble acid salts,
especially RH<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_16_221" id="FNanchor_16_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_221" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Phosphoric anhydride, or any of its hydrates, when ignited with an
excess of sodium hydroxide, carbonate, &amp;c., forms normal or <i>trisodium
orthophosphate</i>, Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, but when a solution of sodium carbonate is
decomposed by orthophosphoric acid, only the salt Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> is
formed; and when an excess of sodium chloride is ignited with
orthophosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid is evolved, and the acid salt
H<sub>2</sub>NaPO<sub>4</sub> alone is formed. These facts clearly indicate the small
energy of phosphoric acid with respect to the formation of the tri-metallic
salt, which is seen further from the fact that the salt Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
has an alkaline reaction, decomposes in the presence of water and carbonic
acid, forming Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, corrodes glass vessels in which it is
boiled or evaporated, just like solutions of the alkalis, disengages, like
them, ammonia from ammonium chloride, and crystallises from solutions,
as Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, only in the presence of an excess of alkali.
At 15° the crystals of this salt require five parts of water for solution;
they fuse at 77°.</p>

<p><i>Disodium orthophosphate</i>, or common sodium phosphate, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>,
is more stable both in solution and in the solid state. As it is used in
medicine and in dyeing, it is prepared in considerable quantities, most
frequently from the impure phosphoric acid obtained by the action of
sulphuric acid on bone ash. The solution thus formed&mdash;which contains,
besides phosphoric and sulphuric acids, salts of sodium, calcium, and
magnesium&mdash;is heated, and sodium carbonate added so long as carbonic
anhydride is disengaged. A precipitate is formed containing the
insoluble salts of magnesium and calcium, whilst the solution contains
sodium phosphate, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, with a small quantity of other salts, from
which it may be easily purified by crystallisation. At the ordinary
temperature its solutions, especially in the presence of a small amount
of sodium carbonate, give finely-formed inclined prismatic crystals,
Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O; when the crystallisation takes place above 30°
they only contain 7H<sub>2</sub>O. The former crystals even lose a portion of
their water of crystallisation at the ordinary temperature (the salt
effloresces), and form the second salt with 7H<sub>2</sub>O; whilst under the
receiver of an air-pump and over sulphuric acid they also part with
this water.<a name="FNanchor_17_222" id="FNanchor_17_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_222" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> When ignited they lose the last molecule of water of
constitution, and give sodium pyrophosphate, Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.</p>

<p><i>Monosodium orthophosphate</i>, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, crystallises with one
equivalent of water; its solution has an acid reaction. At 100° the
salt only loses this water of crystallisation, and at about 200° it parts
with all its water, forming the metaphosphate NaPO<sub>3</sub>. It is prepared
from ordinary sodium phosphate by adding phosphoric acid
until the solution does not give a precipitate with barium chloride, and
then evaporating and crystallising the solution. The solution of this
salt does not absorb carbonic anhydride, and does not give a precipitate
with salts of calcium, barium, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_18_223" id="FNanchor_18_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_223" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>As a hydrate, orthophosphoric acid should be expressed, after the
fashion of other hydrates, as containing three water residues (hydroxyl
groups), <i>i.e.</i> as PO(OH)<sub>3</sub>. This method of expression indicates that
the type PX<sub>5</sub>, seen in PH<sub>4</sub>I, is here preserved, with the substitution
of X<sub>2</sub> by oxygen and X<sub>3</sub> by three hydroxyl groups. The same
type appears in POCl<sub>3</sub>, PCl<sub>5</sub>, PF<sub>5</sub>, &amp;c. And if we recognise phosphoric
acid as PO(OH)<sub>3</sub>, we should expect to find three anhydrides
corresponding with it: (1) [PO(OH)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub>O, in which two of the three
hydroxyls are preserved; this is pyrophosphoric acid, H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. (2)
PO(OH)O, where only one hydroxyl is preserved. This is metaphosphoric
acid. (3) (PO)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, that is, perfect phosphoric anhydride.
Therefore, <i>pyro- and metaphosphoric acids are imperfect anhydrides</i> (or
anhydro-acids) <i>of orthophosphoric acid</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_224" id="FNanchor_19_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_224" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pyrophosphoric acid</i>, H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, is formed by heating orthophosphoric
acid to 250° when it loses water.<a name="FNanchor_19_BIS_225" id="FNanchor_19_BIS_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_BIS_225" class="fnanchor">[19 bis]</a> Its normal salts are
formed by igniting the dimetallic salts of orthophosphoric acid of
the types HM<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. Thus from the disodium salt we obtain sodium
pyrophosphate, Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (it crystallises from water with 10H<sub>2</sub>O, is
very stable, fuses when heated, has an alkaline reaction, and does not
form ortho-salts when its solution is boiled): and from the monosodium
salt NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> the acid salt Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (easily soluble in
water) is formed; this has an acid reaction, and when ignited further
gives the meta-salt.<a name="FNanchor_20_226" id="FNanchor_20_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_226" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><i>Metaphosphoric acid</i>, HPO<sub>3</sub> (the analogue of nitric acid), is formed
by the ignition of the pyro- and ortho-acids (or, better, of their
ammonium salts), as a vitreous, hygroscopic, fused mass (glacial phosphoric
acid, <i>acidum phosphoricum glaciale</i>), soluble in water and
volatilising without decomposition. It is also formed in the first
slow action of cold water on the anhydride, but metaphosphoric acid
gradually changes into the ortho-acid when its solution is boiled, or
when it is kept for any length of time, especially in the presence of
acids.<a name="FNanchor_21_227" id="FNanchor_21_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_227" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In order to see the relation between phosphoric acid and the lower
acids of phosphorus, it is simplest to imagine the substitution of
hydroxyl in H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> or PO(OH)<sub>3</sub> by hydrogen. Then from orthophosphoric
acid, PO(OH)<sub>3</sub>, we shall obtain phosphorous acid, POH(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
and hypophosphorous acid, POH(OH); and, furthermore, phosphorous
acid should be bibasic if orthophosphoric acid was tribasic, and
hypophosphorous acid should be monobasic. This conclusion<a name="FNanchor_21_BIS_228" id="FNanchor_21_BIS_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_BIS_228" class="fnanchor">[21 bis]</a> is,
in fact, true, and hence all the acids of phosphorus may be referred
to one common type, PX<sub>5</sub>, whose representatives are PH<sub>4</sub>I and
PCl<sub>5</sub>, POCl<sub>3</sub>, PCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Phosphorous acid</i>, PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is generally obtained from phosphorus
trichloride, PCl<sub>3</sub>, by the action of water: PCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 3HCl
+ PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Both acids formed are soluble in water, but are easily
separated, because hydrochloric acid is volatile whilst phosphorous
acid volatilises with difficulty, and if a small amount of water be
originally taken the hydrochloric acid nearly all passes off directly.
Concentrated solutions of phosphorous acid give crystals of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>,
which fuse at 70°, attract moisture from the air, and deliquesce when
ignited, giving phosphine and phosphoric acid,<a name="FNanchor_22_229" id="FNanchor_22_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_229" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and are oxidised into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
orthophosphoric acid by many oxidising agents. In its salts only two
hydrogen atoms are replaced by metals (Würtz); the salts of the
alkaline metals are soluble, and give precipitates with salts of the
majority of other metals.</p>

<p>The monobasic <i>hypophosphorous acid</i>, PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, gives salts PH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Na,
(PH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ba, &amp;c.; the two remaining atoms of hydrogen (which
exist in the same form as in phosphine, PH<sub>3</sub>) are not replaceable by
metals, and this determines the property of these salts of evolving
phosphuretted hydrogen when heated (especially with alkalis). In
acting on substances liable to reduction it is this hydrogen which acts,
and, for example, <i>reduces</i> gold and mercury from the solutions of
their salts, or converts cupric into cuprous salts. In all these instances
the hypophosphorous acid is converted into phosphoric acid. Under
the action of zinc and sulphuric acid it gives phosphine, PH<sub>3</sub>. Nevertheless,
neither hypophosphorous acid nor its dry salts absorb oxygen
from the air. The salts of hypophosphorous acid are more soluble
than those of the preceding acids of phosphorus. Thus the sodium
salt PNaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> does not give a precipitate with barium chloride, and
the salts of calcium, barium, and many other metals are soluble.<a name="FNanchor_23_230" id="FNanchor_23_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_230" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
The hypophosphites are prepared by boiling an alkali with phosphorus
so long as phosphuretted hydrogen is evolved. The acid itself is
obtained from barium hypophosphite (prepared in the same manner by
boiling phosphorus in baryta water), by decomposing its solution with
sulphuric acid. By concentration of the solution of hypophosphorous
acid (it must not be heated above 130°, at which temperature it
decomposes) a syrup is formed which is able to crystallise. In the
solid state hypophosphorous acid fuses at +17°, and has the properties
of a clearly defined acid.</p>

<p>The types PX<sub>3</sub> and PX<sub>5</sub>, which are evident for the hydrogen and
oxygen compounds of phosphorus, are most clearly seen in its halogen
compounds,<a name="FNanchor_24_231" id="FNanchor_24_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_231" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> to the consideration of which we will proceed, fixing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
our attention more especially on the chlorine compounds, as being
the most important from the historical, theoretical, and practical point
of view.</p>

<p>Phosphorus burns in chlorine, forming phosphorous chloride, PCl<sub>3</sub>,
and with an excess of chlorine, phosphoric chloride, PCl<sub>5</sub>. The
oxychloride, POCl<sub>3</sub>, as the simplest chloranhydride according to the
type PX<sub>5</sub>, and also phosphoric chloride, correspond with orthophosphoric
acid, PO(OH)<sub>3</sub>, while phosphorous chloride, PCl<sub>3</sub>, corresponds
with phosphorous acid and the type PX<sub>3</sub>. Phosphoric oxychloride,
POCl<sub>3</sub>, is a colourless liquid, boiling at 110°. Phosphorus trichloride
is also a colourless liquid, boiling at 76°,<a name="FNanchor_25_232" id="FNanchor_25_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_232" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> whilst phosphoric chloride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
is a solid yellowish substance, which volatilises without melting at
about 168°. They are all heavier than water, and form types of
the <i>chloranhydrides</i> or chlorine compounds of the non-metallic elements
whose hydrates are acids, just as NaCl or BaCl<sub>2</sub> are types of halogen
metallic salts.</p>

<p>If a piece of phosphorus be dropped into a flask containing chlorine,
it burns when touched with a red-hot wire, and combines with the
chlorine. If the phosphorus be in excess, liquid <i>phosphorus trichloride</i>,
PCl<sub>3</sub>, is always formed, but if the chlorine be in excess the
solid pentachloride is obtained. The trichloride is generally prepared
in the following manner. Dry chlorine (passed through a series
of Woulfe's bottles containing sulphuric acid) is led into a retort containing
sand and phosphorus. The retort is heated, the phosphorus
melts, spreads through the sand, and gradually forms the trichloride,
which distils over into a receiver, where it condenses.
<i>Phosphoric chloride</i> or <i>phosphorus pentachloride</i>, PCl<sub>5</sub>, is prepared by
passing dry chlorine into a vessel containing phosphorus trichloride
(purified by distillation). Phosphorous chloride combines directly with
oxygen, but more rapidly with ozone or with the oxygen of potassium
chlorate (3PCl<sub>3</sub> + KClO<sub>3</sub> = 3POCl<sub>3</sub> + KCl), forming <i>phosphorus oxychloride</i>,
POCl<sub>3</sub> (Brodie). This compound is also formed by the first
action of water on phosphoric chloride; for example, if two vessels,
one containing phosphoric chloride and the other water, are placed
under a bell jar, after a certain time the crystals of the chloride
disappear and hydrochloric acid passes into the water. The aqueous
vapour acts on the pentachloride, and the following reaction occurs:
PCl<sub>5</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = POCl<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl, the result being that liquid phosphorus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
oxychloride is found in one vessel, and a solution of hydrochloric acid in
the other. However, an excess of water directly transforms phosphoric
chloride into orthophosphoric acid, PCl<sub>5</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 5HCl,<a name="FNanchor_26_233" id="FNanchor_26_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_233" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
since POCl<sub>3</sub> reacts with water (3H<sub>2</sub>O), forming 3HCl and phosphoric
acid PO(OH)<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The above chlorine compounds serve not only as a type of the
chloranhydrides, but also as a means for the preparation of other
<i>acid chloranhydrides</i>. Thus the conversion of acids XHO into chloranhydrides,
XCl, is generally accomplished by means of <i>phosphorus
pentachloride</i>. This fact was discovered by Chancel, and adopted by
Gerhardt as an important method for studying organic acids. By this
means organic acids, containing, as we know, RCOOH (where R is a
hydrocarbon group, and where carboxyl may repeat itself several times
by replacing the hydrogen of hydrocarbon compounds), are converted
into their chloranhydrides, RCOCl. With water they again form the
acid, and resemble the chloranhydrides of mineral acids in their
general properties.</p>

<p>Since carbonic acid, CO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, contains two hydroxyl groups, its
perfect chloranhydride, COCl<sub>2</sub>, <i>carbonic oxychloride</i>, <i>carbonyl chloride</i>
or <i>phosgene gas</i>, contains two atoms of chlorine, and differs from
the chloranhydrides of organic acids in that in them one atom of
chlorine is replaced by the hydrocarbon radicle RCOCl, if R be a
monatomic radicle giving a hydrocarbon RH. It is evident, on the
one hand, that in RCOCl the hydrogen is replaced by the radicle
COCl, which is also able to replace several atoms of hydrogen (for
example, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(COCl)<sub>2</sub> corresponds with the bibasic succinic acid);
and, on the other hand, that the reactions of the chloranhydrides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
organic acids will answer to the reactions of carbonyl chloride, as the reactions
of the acids themselves answer to those of carbonic acid. Carbonyl
chloride is obtained directly from dry carbon monoxide and chlorine<a name="FNanchor_27_234" id="FNanchor_27_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_234" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
exposed to the action of light, and forms a colourless gas, which easily
condenses into a liquid, boiling at +8°, specific gravity 1·43, and having
the suffocating odour belonging to all chloranhydrides. Like all chloranhydrides,
it is immediately decomposed by water, forming carbonic
anhydride, according to the equation COCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl,
and thus expresses the type proper to all chloranhydrides of both
mineral and organic acids.<a name="FNanchor_28_235" id="FNanchor_28_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_235" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In order to show the general method for the preparation of acid
chloranhydrides, we will take that of acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>·COOH, as an example.
Phosphorus pentachloride is placed in a glass retort, and acetic
acid poured over it; hydrochloric acid is then evolved, and the substance
distilling over directly after is a very volatile liquid, boiling at 50°,
and having all the properties of the chloranhydrides. With water it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
forms hydrochloric and acetic acids. The reaction here taking place
may be explained thus: the substitution of the oxygen taken from the
acetic acid (from its carboxyl) by two atoms of chlorine from the
PCl<sub>5</sub> should be as follows: CH<sub>3</sub>·COOH + PCl<sub>5</sub> = CH<sub>3</sub>·COHCl<sub>2</sub> + POCl<sub>3</sub>.
But the compound CH<sub>3</sub>·COHCl<sub>2</sub> does not exist in a free state (because
it would indicate the possibility of the formation of compounds of
the type CX<sub>6</sub>, and carbon only gives those of the type CX<sub>4</sub>); it
therefore splits up into HCl and the chloranhydride CH<sub>3</sub>·COCl. The
general scheme for the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride with
hydrates ROH is exactly the same as with water; namely, ROH with
PCl<sub>5</sub>, gives POCl<sub>3</sub> + HCl + RCl&mdash;that is a chloranhydride.<a name="FNanchor_28_BIS_236" id="FNanchor_28_BIS_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_BIS_236" class="fnanchor">[28 bis]</a></p>

<p>Containing, as they do, chlorine, which easily reacts with hydrogen,
phosphorus pentachloride, trichloride, and oxychloride enter into
reaction with ammonia, and give a series of amide and nitrile compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of phosphorus. Thus, for example, when ammonia acts on the
oxychloride we obtain sal-ammoniac (which is afterwards removed by
water) and an orthophosphoric triamide, PO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, as a white insoluble
powder on which dilute acids and alkalis do not act, but which,
when fused with potassium hydroxide, gives potassium phosphate and
ammonia like other amides. When ignited, the triamide liberates
ammonia and forms the nitrile PON, just as urea, CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
gives off ammonia and forms the nitrile CONH. This nitrile, called
<i>monophosphamide</i>, PON, naturally corresponds with metaphosphoric
acid, namely, with its ammonium salt. NH<sub>4</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O = PO<sub>2</sub>·NH<sub>2</sub>,
an as yet unknown amide, and PO<sub>2</sub>·NH<sub>2</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O gives the nitrile PON.
This relation is confirmed by the fact that PON, moistened with water,
gives metaphosphoric acid when ignited. It is the analogue of nitrous
oxide, NON. It is a very stable compound, more so than the preceding.<a name="FNanchor_29_237" id="FNanchor_29_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_237" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>The most important analogue of phosphorus is <i>arsenic</i>, the metallic
aspect of which and the general character of its compounds of the types
AsX<sub>3</sub> and AsX<sub>5</sub> at once recall the metals. The hydrate of its highest
oxide, arsenic acid (ortho-arsenic acid), H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>, is an oxidising agent,
and gives up a portion of its oxygen to many other substances; but,
nevertheless, it is very like phosphoric acid. Mitscherlich established
the conception of isomorphism by comparing the salts of these acids.<a name="FNanchor_30_238" id="FNanchor_30_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_238" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Arsenic occurs <i>in nature</i>, not only combined with metals, but also,
although rarely, native and also in combination with sulphur in two
minerals&mdash;one red, <i>realgar</i>, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, and the other yellow, <i>orpiment</i>,
As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> (Chapter XX., Note <a href="#Footnote_29_295">29</a>29). Arsenic occurs, but more rarely, in
the form of salts of arsenic acid&mdash;for instance, the so-called cobalt and
nickel blooms, two minerals which are found accompanying other cobalt
ores, are the arsenates of these metals. Arsenic is also found in certain
clays (ochres) and has been discovered in small quantities in some
mineral springs, but it is in general of rarer occurrence in nature than
phosphorus. Arsenic is most frequently extracted from arsenical
pyrites, FeSAs, which, when roasted without access of air, evolves the
vapour of arsenic, ferrous sulphide being left behind. It is also obtained
by heating arsenious anhydride with charcoal, in which case carbonic
oxide is evolved. In general, the oxides and other compounds are very
easily reduced. Solid <i>arsenic</i> is a steel-grey brittle <i>metal</i>, having a
bright lustre and scaly structure. Its specific gravity is 5·7. It is
opaque and infusible, but volatilises as a yellow vapour which on cooling
deposits rhombohedral crystals.<a name="FNanchor_30_BIS_239" id="FNanchor_30_BIS_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_BIS_239" class="fnanchor">[30 bis]</a> The vapour density of arsenic is
150 times greater than that of hydrogen&mdash;that is, its molecule, like that
of phosphorus, contains 4 atoms, As<sub>4</sub>. When heated in the air, arsenic
easily oxidises into white arsenious anhydride, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, but even at the
ordinary temperature it loses its lustre (becomes dull), owing to the
formation of a coating of a lower oxide. The latter appears to be as
volatile as arsenious anhydride, and it is probable that it is owing to
the presence of this compound that the vapours of arsenious compounds,
when heated with charcoal (for example, in the reducing flame of a blow-pipe),
have the characteristic smell of garlic, because the vapour of
arsenic itself has not this odour.</p>

<p>Arsenic easily combines with bromine and chlorine;<a name="FNanchor_31_240" id="FNanchor_31_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_240" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> nitric acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and aqua regia also oxidise it into the higher oxide, or rather its hydrate,
arsenic acid.<a name="FNanchor_32_241" id="FNanchor_32_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_241" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> As far as is known, it does not decompose steam, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
it acts exceedingly slowly on those acids, like hydrochloric, which are
not capable of oxidising.</p>

<p><i>Arseniuretted hydrogen</i>, <i>arsine</i>, AsH<sub>3</sub>, resembles phosphuretted
hydrogen in many respects. This colourless gas, which liquefies into a
mobile liquid at -40°, has a disagreeable garlic-like odour, is only
slightly soluble in water, and is exceedingly poisonous. Even in a
small quantity it causes great suffering, and if present to any considerable
amount in air it even causes death. The other compounds of arsenic
are also poisonous, with the exception of the insoluble sulphur compound
and some compounds of arsenic acid. Arseniuretted hydrogen, AsH<sub>3</sub>,
is obtained by the action of water on the alloy of arsenic and sodium,
sodium hydroxide and arseniuretted hydrogen being formed. It is
also formed by the action of sulphuric acid on the alloy of arsenic and
zinc: Zn<sub>3</sub>As<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = 2AsH<sub>3</sub> + 3ZnSO<sub>4</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_33_242" id="FNanchor_33_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_242" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The oxygen compounds
of arsenic are very easily reduced by the action of hydrogen at the
moment of its evolution from acids, and the reduced arsenic then
combines with the hydrogen; hence, if a certain amount of an oxygen
compound of arsenic be put into an apparatus containing zinc and
sulphuric acid (and thus serving for the evolution of hydrogen), the
hydrogen evolved will contain arseniuretted hydrogen. In this case it
is diluted with a considerable amount of hydrogen. But its presence
in the most minute quantities may be easily recognised from the fact
that it is <i>easily decomposed</i> by heat (200° according to Brunn) into
metallic arsenic and hydrogen, and therefore if such impure hydrogen
he passed through a moderately-heated tube metallic arsenic will be
deposited as a bright layer on the part of the tube which was heated
(<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_30_BIS_239">30 bis</a>). This reaction is so sensitive that it enables the
most minute traces of arsenic to be discovered; hence it is employed
in medical jurisprudence, as a test in poisoning cases. It is easy to
discover the presence of arsenic in common zinc, copper, sulphuric and
hydrochloric acids, <i>&amp;c.</i> by this method. It is obvious that in testing
for poison by Marsh's apparatus it is necessary to take zinc and sulphuric
acid quite free from arsenic. The arsenic deposited in the tube
may be driven as a volatile metal from one place to another in the
current of hydrogen evolved, owing to its volatility. This forms a
distinction between arseniuretted and antimoniuretted hydrogen, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
is decomposed by heat in just the same way as arseniuretted hydrogen,
but the mirror given by Sb is not so volatile as that formed by As.</p>

Woulfe's bottle, and when the gas comes off, a solution containing arsenic is poured through the
funnel. The presence of AsH<sub>3</sub> is recognised from the deposition of a mirror of arsenic when the
gas-conducting tube is heated. If the escaping hydrogen be lighted, and a porcelain dish be held
in the flame, a film of arsenic is deposited on it. The gas is dried by passing through the tube
containing calcium chloride. This apparatus is used for the detection of arsenic by Marsh's test.</p></div>

<p>If hydrogen contains arseniuretted hydrogen, it also gives metallic
arsenic when it burns, because in the reducing flame of hydrogen the
oxygen attracted combines entirely with the hydrogen and not with
the arsenic, so that if a cold object, such as a piece of china, be held in
the hydrogen flame the arsenic will be deposited upon it as a metallic
spot.<a name="FNanchor_34_243" id="FNanchor_34_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_243" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The most common compound of arsenic is the solid and volatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
<i>arsenious anhydride</i>, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which corresponds with phosphorous and
nitrous anhydrides. This very poisonous, colourless, and sweet-tasting
substance is generally known under the name of arsenic, or <i>white
arsenic</i>. The corresponding hydrate is as yet unknown; its solutions,
when evaporated, yield crystals of arsenious anhydride. It is chiefly
prepared for the dyer, and is also used as a vermin killer, and sometimes
in medicine; it is a product from which all other compounds of arsenic
can be prepared. It is obtained as a by-product in roasting cobalt
and other ores containing arsenic. Arsenical pyrites are sometimes
purposely roasted for the extraction of arsenious anhydride. When
arsenical ores are burnt in the air, the sulphur and arsenic are converted
into the oxides As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>. The former is a solid at the ordinary
temperature, and the latter gaseous, and therefore the arsenious anhydride
is deposited as a sublimate in the cooler portion of the flues
through which the vapours escape from the furnace. It collects in
condensing chambers especially constructed in the flues. The deposit
is collected, and after being distilled gives arsenious anhydride in the
form of a vitreous non-crystalline mass. This is one of the varieties of
arsenious anhydride, which is also known in two crystalline forms.
When sublimed&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> when it rapidly passes from the state of vapour
to the solid state&mdash;it appears in the regular system in the form of octahedra.<a name="FNanchor_35_244" id="FNanchor_35_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_244" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
It is obtained in the same form when it is crystallised from
acid solutions. The specific gravity of the crystals is 3·7. The other
crystalline form (in prisms) belongs to the rhombohedral system, and is
also formed by sublimation when the crystals are deposited on a heated

<p>Solutions of arsenious anhydride have a sweet metallic taste, and
give <i>a feeble acid reaction</i>. Its solubility increases with the admixture
of acids and alkalis. This shows the property of arsenious anhydride
of forming salts with acids and alkalis. And in fact compounds of it
with hydrochloric acid (Note <a href="#Footnote_31_240">31</a>31), sulphuric anhydride (<i>see</i> further on),
and with the alkali oxides are known.<a name="FNanchor_37_246" id="FNanchor_37_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_246" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> If silver nitrate be added to
a solution of arsenious anhydride, it does not give any precipitate unless
a certain amount of the arsenious anhydride is saturated with an alkali&mdash;for
instance, ammonia. It then gives a precipitate of silver arsenite,
Ag<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>3</sub>. This is yellow, soluble in an excess of ammonia, and anhydrous;
it distinctly shows that arsenious acid is tribasic, and that it
differs in this respect from phosphorous acid, in which only two atoms of
hydrogen can be replaced by metals.<a name="FNanchor_38_247" id="FNanchor_38_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_247" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The feeble acid character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
arsenious anhydride is confirmed by the formation of saline compounds
with acids. In this respect the most remarkable example is the
anhydrous compound with sulphuric acid, having the composition
As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,SO<sub>3</sub>. It is formed in the roasting of arsenical pyrites in those
spaces where the arsenious anhydride condenses, a portion of the
sulphurous anhydride being converted into sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>,
at the expense of the oxygen of the air. The compound in question
forms colourless tabular crystals, which are decomposed by water with
formation of sulphuric acid and arsenious anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_39_248" id="FNanchor_39_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_248" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><i>Antimony</i> (stibium), Sb = 120, is another analogue of phosphorus.
In its external appearance and the properties of its compounds it resembles
the metals still more closely than arsenic. In fact, antimony
has the appearance, lustre, and many of the characteristic properties of
the metals. Its oxide, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, exhibits the earthy appearance of rust
or of lime, and has distinctly basic properties, although it corresponds
with nitrous and phosphorous anhydride, and is able, like them, to give
saline compounds with bases. At the same time antimony presents, in
the majority of its compounds, an entire analogy with phosphorus and
arsenic. Its compounds belong to the type SbX<sub>3</sub> and SbX<sub>5</sub>. It is
found in nature chiefly in the form of sulphide, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>. This substance
sometimes occurs in large masses in mineral veins and is known in
mineralogy under the name of antimony glance or <i>stibnite</i>, and commercially
as <i>antimony</i> (Chapter XX., Note <a href="#Footnote_29_295">29</a>). The most abundant
deposits of antimony ore occur in Portugal (near Oporto on the Douro).
Besides which antimony partially or totally replaces arsenic in some
minerals; thus, for example, a compound of antimony sulphide and
arsenic sulphide with silver sulphide is found in red silver ore. But in
every case antimony is a rather rare metal found in few localities. In
Russia it is known to occur in Daghestan in the Caucasus. It is
extracted chiefly for the preparation of alloys with lead and tin,
which are used for casting printing type.<a name="FNanchor_40_249" id="FNanchor_40_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_249" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Some of its compounds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
also used in medicine, the most important in this respect being antimony
pentasulphide, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> (<i>sulfur auratum antimonii</i>), and tartar emetic,
which is a double salt derived from tartaric acid and has the composition
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>K(SbO)O<sub>6</sub>. Even the native antimony sulphide is used in
large quantities as a purgative for horses and dogs. Metallic antimony
is extracted from the glance, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, by roasting, when the sulphur
burns away and the antimony oxidises, forming the oxide Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which
is then heated with charcoal, and thus reduced to a <i>metallic state</i>. The
reduction may be carried on in the laboratory on a small scale by
fusing the sulphide with iron which takes up the sulphur.<a name="FNanchor_40_BIS_250" id="FNanchor_40_BIS_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_BIS_250" class="fnanchor">[40 bis]</a></p>

<p>Metallic antimony has a white colour and a brilliant lustre; it
remains untarnished in the air, for the metal does not oxidise at the
ordinary temperature. It crystallises in rhombohedra, and always
shows a distinctly crystalline structure which gives it quite a different
aspect from the majority of the metals yet known. It is most like
tellurium in this respect. Antimony is brittle, so that it is very easily
powdered; its specific gravity is 6·7, it melts at about 432°, but only
volatilises at a bright red heat. When heated in the air&mdash;for instance,
before the blow-pipe&mdash;it burns and gives white odourless fumes, consisting
of the oxide. This oxide is termed antimonious oxide, although
it might as well be termed antimonious anhydride. It is given the
first name because in the majority of cases its compounds with acids
are used, but it forms compounds with the alkalis just as easily.</p>

<p>Antimonious oxide, like arsenious anhydride, crystallises either in
regular octahedra or in rhombic prisms; its specific gravity is 5·56; when
heated it becomes yellow and then fuses, and when further heated in air
it oxidises, forming an oxide of the composition Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Antimonious
oxide is insoluble in water and in nitric acid, but it easily dissolves in
strong hydrochloric acid and in alkalis, as well as in tartaric acid or
solutions of its acid salts. When dissolved in the latter it forms tartar
emetic. It is precipitated from its solutions in alkalis and acids (by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the action of acids on the former and alkalis on the latter). It occurs
native but rarely. As a base it gives salts of the type SbOX (as if the
basic salts = SbX<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and hardly ever forms salts, SbX<sub>3</sub>. In the
antimonyl salts, SbOX, the group SbO is univalent, like potassium or
silver. The oxide itself is (SbO)<sub>2</sub>O, the hydroxide, SbO(OH), &amp;c.;
tartar emetic is a salt in which one hydrogen of tartaric acid is replaced
by potassium and the other by antimonyl, SbO. Antimonious oxide is
very easily separated from its salts by any base, but it must be observed
that this separation does not take place in the presence of tartaric acid,
owing to the property of tartaric acid of forming a soluble double salt&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
tartar emetic.<a name="FNanchor_41_251" id="FNanchor_41_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_251" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>If metallic antimony, or antimonious oxide, be oxidised by an excess
of nitric acid and the resultant mass be carefully evaporated to dryness,
<i>metantimonic acid</i>, SbHO<sub>3</sub>, is formed. Its corresponding potassium
salt, 2SbKO<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, is prepared by fusing metallic antimony with
one-fourth its weight of nitre and washing the resultant mass with
cold water. This potassium salt is only slightly soluble in water (in
50 parts) and the sodium salt is still less so. An ortho-acid, SbH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,
also appears to exist;<a name="FNanchor_41_BIS_252" id="FNanchor_41_BIS_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_BIS_252" class="fnanchor">[41 bis]</a> it is obtained by the action of water on
antimony pentachloride, but it is very unstable, like the pentachloride,
SbCl<sub>5</sub>, itself, which easily gives up Cl<sub>2</sub>, leaving antimony trichloride,
SbCl<sub>3</sub>, and this is decomposed by water, forming an oxychloride&mdash;SbOCl,
only slightly soluble in water. When antimonic acid is heated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to an incipient red heat, it parts with water and forms the anhydride,
Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, of a yellow colour and specific gravity 6·5.<a name="FNanchor_42_253" id="FNanchor_42_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_253" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>The heaviest analogue of nitrogen and phosphorus is <i>bismuth</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Bi = 208. Here, as in the other groups, the basic, metallic, properties
increase with the atomic weight. Bismuth does not give any
hydrogen compound and the highest oxide, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, is a very feeble
acid oxide. Bismuthous oxide, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is a base, and bismuth itself
a perfect metal. To explain the other properties of bismuth it must
further be remarked that in the eleventh series it follows mercury,
thallium and lead, whose atomic weights are near to that of bismuth,
and that therefore it resembles them and more especially its nearest
neighbour, lead. Although PbO and PbO<sub>2</sub>, represent types different
from Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, they resemble them in many respects, even in
their external appearance, moreover the lower oxides both of Pb and Bi
are basic and the higher acid, which easily evolve oxygen. But judging
by the formula, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is a more feeble base than PbO. They both easily
give basic salts.</p>

<p>Bismuth forms compounds of two types, BiX<sub>3</sub> and BiX<sub>5</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_43_254" id="FNanchor_43_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_254" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> which
entirely recall the two types we have already established for the
compounds of lead. Just as in the case of lead, the type PbX<sub>2</sub>, is
basic, stable, easily formed, and passes with difficulty into the higher
and lower types, which are unstable, so also in the case of bismuth the
type of combination BiX<sub>3</sub> is the usual basic form. The higher type of
combination, BiX<sub>5</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_44_255" id="FNanchor_44_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_255" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in fact behaves toward this stable type, BiX<sub>3</sub>, in
exactly the same manner as lead dioxide does to the monoxide; and
bismuthic acid is obtained by the action of chlorine on bismuth oxide
suspended in water, in exactly the same way as lead dioxide is obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
from lead oxide. It is an oxidising agent like lead dioxide, and even
the acid character in bismuthic acid is only slightly more developed
than in lead dioxide. Here, as in the case of lead (minium), intermediate
compounds are easily formed in which the bismuth of the
lower oxide plays the part of a base combined with the acid which is
formed by the higher form of the oxidation of bismuth.</p>

<p class="caption" style="width: 400px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 85.&mdash;Furnace used for the extraction of bismuth
from its ores.</p></div>

<p>In nature, bismuth occurs in only a few localities and in small
quantities, most frequently in a native state, and more rarely as oxide
and as a compound of bismuth sulphide with the sulphides of other
metals, and sometimes in gold ores. It is extracted from its native ores
by simple fusion in the furnace shown in fig. <a href="#fig_85">85</a>. This furnace contains
an inclined iron retort, into
the upper extremity of
which the ore is charged,
and the molten <i>metal</i> flows
from the lower extremity.
It is refined by re-melting,
and the pure metal may be
obtained by dissolving in
nitric acid, decomposing the
resultant salt with water,
and reducing the precipitate
by heating it with charcoal.
Bismuth is a metal which
crystallises very well from a molten state. Its specific gravity is 9·8;
it melts at 269°, and if it be melted in a crucible, allowed to cool slowly,
and the crust broken and the remaining molten liquid poured out, perfect
rhombohedral crystals of bismuth are obtained on the sides of the
crucible.<a name="FNanchor_44_BIS_256" id="FNanchor_44_BIS_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_BIS_256" class="fnanchor">[44 bis]</a> It is brittle, has a grey-coloured fracture with a reddish
lustre, is not hard, and is but very slightly ductile and malleable; it
volatilises at a white heat and easily oxidises. It recalls antimony and
lead in many of its properties. When oxidised in air, or when the
nitrate is ignited, bismuth forms the <i>oxide</i>, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, as a white powder
which fuses when heated and resembles massicot. The addition of an
excess of caustic potash to a solution of a bismuthous salt gives a white
precipitate of the hydroxide, BiO(OH), which loses its water and gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the anhydrous oxide when boiled with a solution of caustic potash.
Both the hydroxide and oxide easily dissolve in acids and form bismuthous
salts.</p>

<p><i>Bismuthous oxide</i>, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is a feeble and unenergetic base. The
normal hydroxide of the oxide Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is Bi(OH)<sub>3</sub>; it parts with water
and forms a metahydroxide (bismuthyl hydroxide), BiO(OH). Both of
these hydroxides have their corresponding saline compounds of the
composition BiX<sub>3</sub> and BiOX. And the form BiOX is nothing else but
the type of the basic salt, because 3ROX = RX + R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. It is evident
that in the type BiX<sub>3</sub> the bismuth replaces three atoms of hydrogen.
And indeed with phosphoric acid solutions of the bismuthous salts
give a precipitate of the composition BiPO<sub>4</sub>. On the other hand, in
the form of compounds BiOX or Bi(OH)<sub>2</sub>X, the univalent group (BiO)
or (BiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is combined with X. Many bismuth salts are formed
according to the type BiOX. For instance the carbonate, (BiO)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,
which corresponds with the other carbonates M<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. It is obtained
as a white precipitate when a solution of sodium carbonate is added to
a solution of a bismuth salt.<a name="FNanchor_45_257" id="FNanchor_45_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_257" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The compound radicle BiO is not a
special natural grouping, as it was formerly represented to be; it is
simply a mode of expression for showing the relation between the compound
in question and the compounds of other oxides.</p>

<p>Three <i>salts of nitric acid</i> are known containing bismuthous
oxide. If metallic bismuth or its oxide be dissolved in nitric acid, it
forms a colourless transparent solution containing a salt which separates
in large transparent crystals containing Bi(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O. When
heated at 80° these crystals melt in their water of crystallisation, and
in so doing lose a portion of their nitric acid together with water,
forming a salt whose empirical formula is Bi<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>. If the preceding
salt belongs to the type BiX<sub>3</sub>, this one should belong to the form
BiOX, because it = BiO(NO<sub>3</sub>) + Bi(H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)(NO<sub>3</sub>). This salt may be
heated to 150° without change. When the first colourless crystalline
salt dissolves in water <i>it is decomposed</i>. There is no decomposition if
an excess of acid be added to the water&mdash;that is to say, the salt is able
to exist in an acid solution without decomposing, without separation of
the so-called basic salt&mdash;but by itself it cannot be kept in solution; water
decomposes this salt, acting on it like an alkali. In other words the
basic properties of bismuthic oxide are so feeble that even water acts by
taking up a portion of the acid from it. Here we see one of the most
striking facts, long since observed, confirming that action of water on
salts about which we have spoken in Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_417">X.</a> and elsewhere. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
action on water may be expressed thus:&mdash;BiX<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = Bi(OH)<sub>2</sub>X
+ 2XH. A salt of the type Bi(OH)<sub>2</sub>X is obtained in the precipitate.
But if the quantity of acid, HX, be increased, the salt BiX<sub>3</sub> is
again formed and passes into solution. The quantity of the salt BiOX
which passes into solution on the addition of a given quantity of acid
depends indisputably on the amount (mass) of water (Muir). The
solution, which is perfectly transparent with a small amount of water,
becomes cloudy and deposits the salt of the type BiOX, when
diluted. The white flaky precipitate of Bi(OH)<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> formed from the
normal salt Bi(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> by mixing it with five parts of water, and in
general with a small amount of water, is used in medicine under the
name of magistery of bismuth.<a name="FNanchor_46_258" id="FNanchor_46_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_258" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Metallic bismuth is used in the preparation of fusible alloys. The
addition of bismuth to many metals renders them very hard, and at the
same time generally lowers their melting point to a considerable extent.
Thus Wood's metal, which contains one part of cadmium, one part of
tin, two parts of lead, and four parts of bismuth, fuses at about 60°, and
in general many alloys composed of bismuth, tin, lead, and antimony
melt below or about the boiling point of water.<a name="FNanchor_47_259" id="FNanchor_47_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_259" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as in group II., side by side with the elements zinc, cadmium,
and mercury in the uneven series, we found calcium, strontium, and
barium in the even series; and as in group IV., parallel to silicon, germanium,
tin, and lead, we noticed thallium, zirconium, cerium, and
thorium; so also in group V. we find, beside those elements of the uneven
series just considered by us, a series of analogues in the even series,
which, with a certain degree of similarity (mainly quantitative, or relative
to the atomic weights), also present a series of particular (qualitative)
independent points of distinction. In the even series are known <i>vanadium</i>,
which stands between titanium and chromium, <i>niobium</i>, between
zirconium and molybdenum, and <i>tantalum</i>, situated near tungsten (an
element of group VI. like chromium and molybdenum). Just as bismuth
is similar in many respects to its neighbour lead, so also do these neighbouring
elements resemble each other, even in their external appearance,
not to mention the quality of their compounds, naturally taking into
account the differences of type corresponding with the different groups.
The occurrence in group V. determines the type of the oxides, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
and R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and the development of an acid character in the higher
oxides. The occurrence in the even series determines the absence of
volatile compounds, RH<sub>3</sub>, for these metals, and a more basic character
of the oxides of a given composition than in the uneven series, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_48_260" id="FNanchor_48_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_260" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Vanadium, niobium, and tantalum belong to the category of rare metals,
and are exceedingly difficult to obtain pure, more especially owing to
their similarity to, and occurrence with, chromium, tungsten and other
metals, and also in combination among themselves; therefore it is
natural that they have been far from completely studied, although since
1860 chemists have devoted not a little time to their investigation.
The researches carried out by Marignac, at Geneva, on niobium,
and by Sir Henry Roscoe, at Manchester, on vanadium deserve
special attention. The undoubted external resemblance of the compounds
of chromium and vanadium, as well as the want of completeness
in the knowledge of the compounds of vanadium, long caused
its oxides to be considered analogous in atomic composition to those
formed by chromium. The higher oxide of vanadium was therefore
supposed to have the formula VO<sub>3</sub>. But the fact of the matter is,
that the chemical analogy of the elements does not hold in one
direction only; vanadium is at one and the same time the analogue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
chromium, and consequently of the elements like sulphur of group VI,
and also the analogue of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony; just as
bismuth stands in respect to lead and antimony. Investigation has
shown that the compounds of vanadium are always accompanied by those
of phosphorus as well as of iron, and that it is even more difficult to
separate it from the compounds of phosphorus than from those of iron
and tungsten. We should have to extend our description considerably
if we wished to give the complete history, even of vanadium alone, not
to mention niobium and tantalum, all the more as questions would not
unfrequently arise concerning the compounds of these elements which
have not yet been fully elucidated. We shall therefore limit ourselves
to pointing out the most important features in the history of these
elements, the more so since the minerals themselves in which they occur
are exceedingly rare and only accessible to a few investigators.</p>

<p>An important point in the history of the members of this group
is the circumstance that they form volatile compounds with chlorine,
similar to the compounds of the elements of the phosphorus group,
namely, of the type RX<sub>5</sub>. The vapour densities of the compounds
of this kind were determined, and served as the most important
basis for the explanation of the atomic composition of these molecules.
In this we see the power of general and fundamental laws, like the
law of Avogadro-Gerhardt. An oxychloride, VOCl<sub>3</sub>, is known for
vanadium, which is the perfect analogue of phosphorus oxychloride.
It was formerly considered to be vanadium chloride, for just as in
the case of uranium (Chapter <a href="#Page_276">XXI.</a>), its lower oxide, VO, was considered
to be the metal, because it is exceedingly difficultly reduced&mdash;even
potassium does not remove all the oxygen, besides which it has
a metallic appearance, and decomposes acids like a metal; in a word, it
simulates a metal in every respect. <i>Vanadium oxychloride</i> is obtained
by heating the trioxide, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, mixed with charcoal, in a current of hydrogen;
the lower oxide of vanadium is then formed, and this, when
heated in a current of dry chlorine, gives the oxychloride VOCl<sub>3</sub> as a
reddish liquid which does not act on sodium and may be purified by
distillation over this metal. It fumes in the air, giving reddish vapours;
it reacts on water, forming hydrochloric and vanadic acids; hence,
on the one hand it is very similar to phosphorus oxychloride, and on
the other hand to chromium oxychloride, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (Chapter <a href="#Page_276">XXI.</a>).
It is of a yellow colour, its specific gravity is 1·83, it boils at 120°, and
its vapour density is 86 with respect to hydrogen; therefore the above
formula expresses its molecular weight.<a name="FNanchor_49_261" id="FNanchor_49_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_261" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Vanadic anhydride</i>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, is obtained either in small quantities
from certain clays where it accompanies the oxides of iron (hence some
sorts of iron contain vanadium) and phosphoric acid, or from the rare
minerals: <i>volborthite</i>, CuHVO<sub>4</sub>, or basic vanadate of copper; <i>vanadinite</i>,
PbCl<sub>2</sub>3Pb<sub>3</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; lead vanadate, Pb<sub>3</sub>(VO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. The latter
salts are carefully ignited for some time with one-third of their weight of
nitre; the fused mass thus formed is powdered and boiled in water: the
yellow solution obtained contains potassium vanadate. The solution
is neutralised with acid, and barium chloride added; a meta-salt,
Ba(VO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is then precipitated as an almost insoluble white powder,
which gives a solution of vanadic acid when boiled with sulphuric
acid. (The precipitate is at first yellow, as long as it remains amorphous,
but it afterwards becomes crystalline and white.) The solution
thus obtained is neutralised with ammonia, which thus forms ammonium
(meta) vanadate, NH<sub>4</sub>VO<sub>3</sub>, which, when evaporated, gives colourless
crystals, insoluble in water containing sal-ammoniac; hence this
salt is precipitated by adding solid sal-ammoniac to the solution.
Ammonium vanadate, when ignited, leaves vanadic acid behind. In
this it differs from the corresponding chromium salt, which is deoxidised
into chromium oxide when ignited. In general, vanadic acid
has but a small oxidising action. It is reduced with difficulty, like
phosphoric or sulphuric acid, and in this differs from arsenic and
chromic acids. Vanadic acid, like chromic acid, separates from its solution
as the anhydride V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and not in a hydrous state. Vanadic
anhydride, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, forms a reddish-brown mass, which easily fuses and re-solidifies
into transparent crystals having a violet lustre (another point
of resemblance to chromic acid); it dissolves in water, forming a yellow
solution with a slightly acid reaction.<a name="FNanchor_50_262" id="FNanchor_50_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_262" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Niobium and tantalum</i><a name="FNanchor_51_263" id="FNanchor_51_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_263" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> occur as acids in rare minerals, and are
mainly extracted from <i>tantalite</i> and <i>columbite</i>, which are found in
Bavaria, Finland, North America, and in the Urals. These minerals
are composed of the ferrous salts of niobic and tantalic acids; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
contain about 15 per cent. of ferrous oxide in isomorphous mixture
with manganous oxide, in combination with various proportions of
tantalic and niobic anhydrides. These minerals are first fused with
a considerable amount of potassium bisulphate, and the fused mass
is boiled in water, which dissolves the ferrous and potassium salts and
leaves an insoluble residue of impure niobic and tantalic acids. This
raw product is then treated with ammonium sulphide, in order to
extract the tin and tungsten, which pass into solution. The residue
containing the acids (according to Marignac) is then treated with hydrofluoric
acid, in which it entirely dissolves, and potassium fluoride is
added to the resultant hot solution; on cooling, a sparingly soluble
double fluoride of potassium and tantalum separates out in fine crystals,
while the much more soluble niobium salt remains in solution. The
difference in the solubility of these double salts in water acidified with
hydrofluoric acid (in pure water the solution becomes cloudy after a
certain time) is so great that the tantalum compound requires 150 parts
of water for its solution, and the niobium compound only 13 parts.
The Greenland columbite (specific gravity 5·36) only contains niobic
acid, and that from Bodenmais, Bavaria (specific gravity 6·06) almost
equal quantities of tantalic and niobic acids. Having isolated tantalic
and niobic salts, Marignac found that the relation between the potassium
and fluorine in them is very variable&mdash;that is, that there exist
various double salts of fluoride of potassium, and of the fluorides of
the metals of this group, but that with an excess of hydrofluoric acid
both the tantalum and niobium compounds contain seven atoms of
fluorine to two of potassium, whence it must be concluded that the
simplest formula for these double salts will be K<sub>2</sub>RF<sub>7</sub> = RF<sub>5</sub>,2KF;
that is, that the type of the higher compounds of niobium and tantalum
is RX<sub>5</sub>, and hence is similar to phosphoric acid. A chloride, TaCl<sub>5</sub>,
may be obtained from pure tantalic acid by heating it with charcoal
in a current of chlorine. This is a yellow crystalline substance, which
melts at 211°, and boils at 241°; its vapour density with respect to
hydrogen is 180, as would follow from the formula TaCl<sub>5</sub>. It is completely
decomposed by water into tantalic and hydrochloric acids.
<i>Niobium pentachloride</i> may be prepared in the same manner; it fuses
at 194°, and boils at 240°. When treated with water this substance
gives a solution containing niobic acid, which only separates out on
boiling the solution. Delafontaine and Deville found its vapour
density to be 9·3 (air = 1), as is shown by its formula NbCl<sub>5</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_52_264" id="FNanchor_52_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_264" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

ash, chiefly calcium phosphate. The salts of phosphoric acid are also found in the mass
of the earth as separate minerals; for example, the <i>apatites</i> contain this salt in a
crystalline form, combined with calcium chloride or fluoride, CaR<sub>2</sub>,3Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, where
R = F or Cl, sometimes in a state of isomorphous mixture. This mineral often crystallises
in fine hexagonal prisms; sp. gr. 3·17 to 3·22. Vivianite is a hydrated ferrous phosphate,

<i>tagilite</i>, Cu<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. Lead and aluminium form similar salts. They are
nearly all insoluble in water. The turquoise, for instance, is hydrated phosphate of alumina,
(Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O, coloured with a salt of copper. Sea and other waters always contain
a small amount of phosphates. The ash of sea-plants, as well as of land-plants, always
contains phosphates. Deposits of calcium phosphate are often met with; they are termed
<i>phosphorites</i> and <i>osteolites</i>, and are composed of the fossil remains of the bones of animals;
they are used for manure. Of the same nature are the so-called guano deposits from
Baker's Island, and entire strata in Spain, France, and in the Governments of Orloff
and Kursk in Russia. It is evident that if a soil destined for cultivation contain very
little phosphoric acid, the fertilisation by means of these minerals will be beneficial,
but, naturally, only if the other elements necessary to plants be present in the soil.</p></div>

it is possible to obtain a fresh quantity of the acid salt from the residue, and in this
manner to extract all the phosphorus. It is usual to take burnt bones, but mineral
phosphorites, osteolites, and apatites may also be employed as materials for the extraction
of phosphorus. Its extraction for the
manufacture of matches is everywhere extending,
and in Russia, in the Urals, in the Government of
Perm, it has attained such proportions that the
district is able to supply other countries with phosphorus.
A great many methods have been proposed
for facilitating the extraction of phosphorus, but
none of them differ essentially from the usual one,
because the problem is dependent on the liberation
of phosphoric acid by the action of acids, and on its
ultimate reduction by charcoal. Thus the calcium
phosphate may be mixed directly with charcoal and
sand, and phosphorus will be liberated on heating
the mixture, because the silica displaces the phosphoric
anhydride, which gives carbonic oxide and
phosphorus with the charcoal. It has also been
proposed to pass hydrochloric acid over an incandescent
mixture of calcium phosphate and charcoal;
the acid then acts just as the silica does, liberating
phosphoric anhydride, which is reduced by the
charcoal. It is necessary to prevent the access of air in the condensation of the vapours
of phosphorus, because they take fire very easily; hence they are condensed under water
by causing the gaseous products to pass through a vessel full of water. For this purpose
the condenser shown in fig. <a href="#fig_83">83</a> is usually employed.</p></div>

by a large surface of phosphorus proceeds so uniformly, regularly, and rapidly, that it
may serve, as Ikeda (Tokio, 1893) has shown, for demonstrating the law of the velocity
(rate) of reaction, which is considered in theoretical chemistry, and shows that the rate
of reaction is proportional to the active mass of a substance&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> <i>dx</i>/<i>dt</i> = <i>k</i>(A - <i>x</i>) where
<i>t</i> is the time, A the initial mass of the reacting substance&mdash;in this case oxygen&mdash;<i>x</i>
the amount of it which has entered into reaction, and <i>k</i> the coefficient of proportionality.
Ikeda took a test-tube (diameter about 10 mm.), and covered its outer surface with a
coating of phosphorus (by melting it in a test-tube of large diameter, inserting the
smaller test-tube, and, when the phosphorus had solidified, breaking away the outer test-tube),
and introduced it into a definite volume of air, contained in a Woulfe's bottle
(immersed in a water bath to maintain a constant temperature), one of whose orifices
was connected with a mercury manometer showing the fall of pressure, <i>x</i>. Knowing
that the initial pressure of the oxygen (in air nearly 750 × ·0209) was about 155 mm. = A,
the coefficient of the rate of reaction <i>k</i> is given, by the law of the variation of the rate of
reaction with the mass of the reacting substance, by the equation:

phosphorus, but even the alkalis are attacked&mdash;that is, phosphorus acts as a reducing
agent. In fact it reduces many substances, for instance, copper from its salts.
When phosphorus is heated with sodium carbonate, the latter is partially reduced to
carbon. If phosphorus be placed under water slightly warmed, and a stream of oxygen
be passed over it, it will burn under the water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_201" id="Footnote_4_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_201"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The thermochemical determinations for phosphorus and its compounds date from
the last century, when Lavoisier and Laplace burnt phosphorus in oxygen in an ice
calorimeter. Andrews, Despretz, Favre, and others have studied the same subject. The
most accurate and complete data are due to Thomsen. To determine the heat of
combustion of yellow phosphorus, Thomsen oxidised it in a calorimeter with iodic acid in
the presence of water, and a mixture of phosphorous and phosphoric acids was thus
formed (was not any hypophosphoric acid formed?&mdash;Salzer), and the iodic acid converted
into hydriodic acid. It was first necessary to introduce two corrections into the calorimetric
result obtained, one for the oxidation of the phosphorous into phosphoric acid,
knowing their relative amounts by analysis, and the other for the deoxidation of the
iodic acid. The result then obtained expresses the conversion of phosphorous into
hydrated phosphoric acid. This must be corrected for the heat of solution of the hydrate
in water, and for the heat of combination of the anhydride with water, before we can
obtain the heat evolved in the reaction of P<sub>2</sub> with O<sub>5</sub> in the proportion for the formation
of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. It is natural that with so complex a method there is a possibility of many
small errors, and the resultant figures will only present a certain degree of accuracy
after repeated corrections by various methods. Of such a kind are the following figures
determined by Thomsen, which we express in thousands of calories:&mdash;P<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>5</sub> = 370;
P<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 400; P<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>5</sub> + a mass of water = 405. Hence we see that P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
= 30; 2PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + an excess of water = 5. Experiment further showed that crystallised
PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, in dissolving in water, evolves 2·7 thousand calories, and that fused (39°) PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
evolves 5·2 thousand calories, whence the heat of fusion of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 2·5 thousand calories.
For phosphorous acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>, Thomsen obtained P<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 250, and the solution of
crystallised H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> in water = -0·13, and of fused H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> = +2·9. For hypophosphorous
acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>, the heats of solution are nearly the same (-0·17 and +2·1), and the heat
of formation P<sub>2</sub> + O + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 75; hence its conversion into 2H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> evolves 175 thousand
calories, and the conversion of 2H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> into 2H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 150 thousand calories. For the
sake of comparison we will take the combination of chlorine with phosphorus, also
according to Thomsen, per 2 atoms of phosphorus, P<sub>2</sub> + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> = 151, P<sub>2</sub> + 5Cl<sub>2</sub> = 210 thousand
calories. In their reaction on an excess of water (with the formation of a solution),
2PCl<sub>3</sub> = 130, 2PCl<sub>5</sub> = 247, and 2POCl<sub>3</sub> = 142 thousand calories.</p>

<p>Besides which we will cite the following data given by various observers: heat of
fusion for P (that is, for 31 parts of phosphorus by weight) -0·15 thousand calories; the
conversion of yellow into red phosphorus for P, from +19 to +27 thousand calories;
P + H<sub>3</sub> = 4·3, HI + PH<sub>3</sub> = 24, PH<sub>3</sub> + HBr = 22 thousand calories.</p>

<p>At the ordinary temperature (20° C.) phosphorus is not oxidised by pure oxygen;
oxidation only takes place with a slight rise of temperature, or the dilution of the oxygen
with other gases (especially nitrogen or hydrogen), or a decrease of pressure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_BIS_202" id="Footnote_4_BIS_202"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_BIS_202"><span class="label">[4 bis]</span></a> Ordinary phosphorus takes fire at a temperature (60°) at which no other known
substance will burn. Its application to the manufacture of matches is based on this
property. In order to illustrate the easy inflammability of common (yellow) phosphorus,
its solution in carbon bisulphide may be poured over paper; this solvent quickly
evaporates, and the free phosphorus spread over a large surface takes fire spontaneously,
notwithstanding the cooling effect produced by the evaporation of the bisulphide. The
majority of <i>phosphorus matches</i> are composed of common phosphorus mixed with some
oxidising substance which easily gives up oxygen, such as lead dioxide, potassium
chlorate, nitre, &amp;c. For this purpose common phosphorus is carefully triturated under
warm water containing a little gum; lead dioxide and potassium nitrate are then added
to the resultant emulsion, and the match ends, previously coated with sulphur or paraffin,
are dipped into this preparation. After this the matches are dipped into a solution
of gum and shellac, in order to preserve the phosphorus from the action of the air.
When such a match containing particles of yellow phosphorus is rubbed over a rough
surface, it becomes (especially at the point of rupture of the brittle gummy coating)
slightly heated, and this is sufficient to cause the phosphorus to take fire and burn at
the expense of the oxygen of the other ingredients.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_203" id="Footnote_5_203"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_203"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In the so-called &lsquo;safety&rsquo; or Swedish matches (which are not poisonous, and do not
take fire from accidental friction) a mixture of red phosphorus and glass forms the
surface on which the matches are struck, and the matches themselves do not contain any
phosphorus at all, but a mixture of antimonious sulphide, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> (or similar combustible
substances) and potassium chlorate (or other oxidising agents). The combustion,
when once started by contact with the red phosphorus, proceeds by itself
at the expense of the inflammatory and combustible elements contained in the tip of the
match. The mixture applied on the match itself must not be liable to take fire from a blow
or friction. The mixture forming the heads of the &lsquo;safety&rsquo; matches has the following
approximate composition: 55&ndash;60 parts of chlorate of potassium, 5&ndash;10 parts of peroxide of
manganese (or of K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), about 1 part of sulphur or charcoal, about 1 part of pentasulphide
of antimony, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, and 30&ndash;40 parts of rouge and powdered glass. This mixture
is stirred up in gum or glue, and the matches are dipped into it. The paper on which
the matches are struck is coated with a mixture of red phosphorus and trisulphide of
antimony, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, stirred up in dextrine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_205" id="Footnote_6_205"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_205"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The specific heat of the yellow variety is 0·189&mdash;that is, greater than that of the red
variety, which is 0·170. The sp. gr. of the yellow is 1·84, and of the red prepared at 260°
2·15, and of that prepared at 580° and above (<i>i.e.</i> &lsquo;metallic&rsquo; phosphorus, <i>see</i> below)
= 2·34. At 230° the pressure of the vapour of ordinary phosphorus = 514 millimetres
of mercury, and of the red = 0&mdash;that is to say, the red phosphorus does not form
any vapour at this temperature; at 447° the vapour tension of ordinary phosphorus is at
first = 5500 mm., but it gradually diminishes, whilst that of red phosphorus is equal to
1636 mm.</p>

<p>Hittorf, by heating the lower portion of a closed tube containing red phosphorus to
530° and the upper portion to 447°, obtained crystals of the so-called &lsquo;metallic&rsquo; phosphorus
at the upper extremity. As the vapour tensions (according to Hittorf, at 530° the vapour
tension of yellow phosphorus = 8040 mm., of red = 6139 mm., and of metallic = 4130 mm.)
and reactions are different, <i>metallic phosphorus</i> may be regarded as a distinct variety.
It is still less energetic in its chemical reaction than red phosphorus, and it is denser
than the two preceding varieties: sp. gr. = 2·34. It does not oxidise in the air; is
crystalline, and has a metallic lustre. It is obtained when ordinary phosphorus is heated
with lead for several hours at 400° in a closed vessel, from which the air has been exhausted.
The resultant mass is then treated with dilute nitric acid, which first dissolves the lead
(phosphorus is electro-negative to lead, and does not, therefore, act on the nitric acid at
first) and leaves brilliant rhombohedral crystals of phosphorus of a dark violet colour
with a slight metallic lustre, which conduct an electric current incomparably better
than the yellow variety; this also is characteristic of the metallic state of phosphorus.</p>

<p>The researches of Lemoine partially explain the passage of yellow (ordinary) phosphorus
into its other varieties. He heated a closed glass globe containing either ordinary or
red phosphorus, in the vapour of sulphur (440°), and then determined the amount of the
red and yellow varieties after various periods of time, by treating the mixture with carbon
bisulphide. It appeared that after the lapse of a certain time a mixture of definite and
equal composition is obtained from both&mdash;that is, between the red and yellow varieties a
state of equilibrium sets in like that of dissociation, or that observed in double decompositions.
But at the same time, the progress of the transformation appeared to be
dependent on the relative quantity of phosphorus taken per volume of the globe
(<i>i.e.</i> upon the pressure). Neglecting the latter, we will cite as an example the amounts
of the red phosphorus transformed into the ordinary, and of the ordinary not converted
into red, per 30 grams of red or yellow taken per litre capacity of the globe,
heated to 440°. When red phosphorus was taken, 4·75 grams of yellow phosphorus were
formed after two hours, four grams after eight hours, three grams after twenty-four hours,
and the last limit remained constant on further heating. When thirty grams of yellow
phosphorus were taken, five grams remained unaltered after two hours, four grams
after eight hours, and after twenty-four hours and more three grams as before.
Troost and Hautefeuille showed that liquid phosphorus in general changes more easily
into the red than does phosphorus vapour, which, however, is able, although slowly, to
deposit red phosphorus.</p>

<p>The question presents itself as to whether phosphorus in a state of vapour is the
ordinary or some other variety? Hittorf (1865) collected many data for the solution of
this problem, which leave no doubt that (as experimental figures show) the density
of the vapour of phosphorus is always the same, although the vapour tension of the
different varieties and their mixtures is very variable. This shows that the different
varieties of phosphorus only occur in a liquid and solid state, as indeed is implied
in the idea of polymerisation. Strictly speaking, the vapour of phosphorus is a
particular state of this substance, and the molecular formula P<sub>4</sub> refers only to it, and not
to any other definite state of phosphorus. But Raoult's solution method showed that
in a benzene solution the fall of the freezing point indicates for ordinary phosphorus a
molecule P<sub>4</sub>, judging by the determinations of Paterno and Nasini (1888), Hirtz (1890),
and Beckmann (1891), who obtained for sulphur by the same method a molecular weight
= S<sub>6</sub>, in conformity with the vapour density. Further research in this direction will
perhaps show the possibility of finding the molecular weight of red phosphorus, if a
means be discovered for dissolving it without converting it into the yellow variety.</p>

<p>I think it will not be out of place here to draw the reader's attention to the fact that
red phosphorus, which we must recognise as polymeric with the yellow, stands nearer to
nitrogen, whose molecule is N<sub>2</sub>, in its small inclination towards chemical reactions,
although judging by its small vapour tension it must be more complex than ordinary
(yellow and white) phosphorus.</p></div>

with nitrogen gives rise to the supposition that similar compounds exist with phosphorus
also. Such a compound was obtained by Granger (1892) by heating mercury with iodide
of phosphorus in a closed tube at 275°-300°. After removing the iodide of mercury
formed, there remain fine rhombic crystals having a metallic lustre, and composition
Hg<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>. This compound is stable, does not alter at the ordinary temperature and only
decomposes at a red heat; when heated in air it burns with a flame. Nitric and hydrochloric
acids do not act upon it, but it is easily decomposed by aqua regia. A phosphide
of copper, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>, was obtained by Granger (1893) by heating a mixture of water,
finely divided copper and red phosphorus in a sealed tube to 130°. The excess of
copper was afterwards washed away by a solution of NH<sub>3</sub> in the presence of air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_208" id="Footnote_7_208"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_208"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The metallic compounds of phosphorus possess a great chemical interest, because
they show a transition from metallic alloys (for instance, of Sb, As) to the sulphides, halogen
salts, and oxides, and on the other hand to the nitrides. Although there are already
many fragmentary data on the subject, the interesting province of the metallic phosphides
cannot yet be regarded as in any way generalised. The varied applications (phosphor-iron,
phosphor-bronze, &amp;c.), which the phosphides have recently acquired should
give a strong incentive to the complete and detailed study of this subject, which
would, in my opinion, help to the explanation of chemical relations beginning with alloys
(solutions) and ending with salts and the compounds of hydrogen (hydrides), because the
phosphor-metals, as is proved by direct experiment, stand in the same relation to phosphuretted
hydrogen as the sulphides do towards sulphuretted hydrogen, or as the metallic
chlorides to hydrochloric acid.</p></div>

hydrogen. Thus BP also gives PH<sub>3</sub> (<i>see</i> Chapter XVII., Note <a href="#Footnote_12_78">12</a>). According to Lüpke
(1890) phosphuretted hydrogen is formed by phosphide of tin. The latter is prepared by
treating molten tin covered with a layer of carbonate of ammonium, with red phosphorus;
200&ndash;300 c.c. of water are then poured into a flask, 3&ndash;5 grams of this phosphide of tin
dropped in, and after driving out the air by a stream of carbonic acid, hydrochloric acid
(sp. gr. 1·104) is poured in. The disengagement of phosphuretted hydrogen takes place on
heating the flask in a water bath. The following is another easy method for preparing
PH<sub>3</sub>. A mixture of 1 part of zinc dust (fume) and 2 parts of red phosphorus are heated
in an atmosphere of hydrogen (the mixture burns in air). Combination takes place
accompanied by a flash, and a grey mass of Zn<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub> is formed which gives PH<sub>3</sub> when treated

These compounds form a branch of organic chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_212" id="Footnote_9_212"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_212"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The periodic law and direct experiment (the molecular weight) show that PH<sub>3</sub> is the
normal compound of P and H and that it is more simple than PH<sub>2</sub> or P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, just as
methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, is more simple than ethane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, whose empirical composition is CH<sub>3</sub>.
The formation of liquid phosphuretted hydrogen may be understood from the law of
substitution. The univalent radicle of PH<sub>3</sub> is PH<sub>2</sub>, and if it is combined with H in PH<sub>3</sub>
it replaces H in liquid phosphuretted hydrogen, which thus gives P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. This substance
corresponds with free amidogen (hydrazine), N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_246">VI.</a>) Probably P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> is able
to combine with HI, and perhaps also with 2HI, or other molecules&mdash;that is, to give a
substance corresponding to phosphonium iodide.</p>

<p><i>Phosphonium iodide</i>, PH<sub>4</sub>I, may be prepared, according to Baeyer, in large quantities
in the following manner:&mdash;100 parts of phosphorus are dissolved in dry carbon
bisulphide in a tubulated retort: when the mixture has cooled, 175 parts of iodide
are added little by little, and the carbon bisulphide is then distilled off, this being done
towards the end of the operation in a current of dry carbonic anhydride at a moderate
temperature. The neck of the retort is then connected with a wide glass tube, and the
tubulure with a funnel furnished with a stopcock, and containing 50 parts of water.
This water is added drop by drop to the phosphorous iodide, and a violent reaction takes
place, with the evolution of hydriodic acid and phosphonium iodide. The latter collects
as crystals in the glass tube and the retort itself. It is purified by further distillations;
more than 100 parts may be obtained. Baeyer expresses the reaction by the
equation P<sub>2</sub>I + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = PH<sub>4</sub>I + PO<sub>2</sub>; and the compound PO<sub>2</sub> may be represented as
phosphorous phosphoric anhydride: P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 4PO<sub>2</sub>. As a better proportion we
may take 400 grams of phosphorus, 680 grams of iodine, and 240 grams of water, and
express the formation thus: 13P + 9I + 21H<sub>2</sub>O = 3H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + 7PH<sub>4</sub>I + 2HI (Chapter XI.,
Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_77_704">77</a>).</p>

<p>Phosphonium iodide and even phosphine act as reducing agents in solutions of
many metallic salts. Cavazzi showed that with a solution of sulphurous anhydride phosphine
gives sulphur and phosphoric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_213" id="Footnote_10_213"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_213"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The air must first be expelled from the flask by hydrogen, or some other gas which
will not support combustion, as otherwise an explosion might take place owing to the
spontaneous inflammability of the phosphuretted hydrogen.</p>

<p>The combustion of phosphuretted hydrogen in oxygen also takes place under water
when the bubbles of both gases meet, and it is very brilliant. The phosphuretted
hydrogen obtained by the action of phosphorus on caustic potash always contains free
hydrogen, and often even the greater part of the gas evolved consists of hydrogen.</p>

<p><i>Pure phosphuretted hydrogen</i> (not containing hydrogen or liquid or solid phosphides)
is obtained by the action of a solution of potash on phosphonium iodide:
PH<sub>4</sub>I + KHO = PH<sub>3</sub> + KI + H<sub>2</sub>O (in just the same way as ammonia is liberated from
ammonium chloride). The reaction proceeds easily, and the purity of the gas is seen
from the fact that it is entirely absorbed by bleaching powder and is not spontaneously
inflammable. Its mixture with oxygen explodes when the pressure is diminished
(Chapter XVIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_8_130">8</a>). The vapours of bromine, nitric acid, &amp;c., cause it to again
acquire the property of inflaming in the air; that is, they partially decompose it,
forming the liquid hydride, P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Oppenheim showed that when red phosphorus is
heated at 200° with hydrochloric acid in a closed tube it forms the compound
PCl<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>), together with phosphine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_BIS_214" id="Footnote_10_BIS_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_BIS_214"><span class="label">[10 bis]</span></a> If there be a deficiency of oxygen, <i>phosphorous anhydride</i> P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is formed. It
was obtained by Thorpe and Tutton (1890) and is easily volatilised, melts at 22°·5, boils
without change (in an atmosphere of N<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub>) at 173°, and is therefore easily separated
from P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which volatilises with difficulty. The vapour density shows that the molecular
weight is double, <i>i.e.</i> P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (like As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). Although colourless, phosphorous anhydride
(its density in a state of fusion at 24° = 1·936) turns yellow and reddens in sun-light
(possibly red phosphorus separates out ?), and decomposes at 400° forming hypophosphorous
anhydride P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Note <a href="#Footnote_11_215">11</a>) and phosphorus. It passes into P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in air and
oxygen, and when slightly heated in oxygen becomes luminous, and ultimately takes
fire. Cold water slowly transforms P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> into phosphoric acid, but hot water gives an
explosion and leads to the formation of PH<sub>3</sub>, (P<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O = PH<sub>3</sub> + 3PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Alkalis
act in the same manner. It takes fire in chlorine and forms POCl<sub>3</sub> and PO<sub>2</sub>Cl, and
combines with sulphur at 160°, forming P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (the molecular formula is double this) a
substance which volatilises in vacuo and is decomposed by water into H<sub>2</sub>S and phosphoric
acid, <i>i.e.</i> it may be regarded as P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, in which O<sub>2</sub> has been replaced by two atoms of
sulphur. Judging from the above, the mixture of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> formed in the combustion
of phosphorus in air is transformed into P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in an excess of oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_215" id="Footnote_11_215"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_215"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Salzer proved the existence of hypophosphoric acid (it is also called subphosphoric
acid), in which many chemists did not believe. Drawe (1888) and Rammelsberg (1892) investigated
its salts. It may be obtained in a free state by the following method. The
solution of acid produced by the slow oxidation of moist phosphorus is mixed with a
solution (25 p.c.) of sodium acetate. A salt, Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, crystallises out on cooling;
it is soluble in 45 parts of water, and gives a precipitate of Pb<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> with lead salts
(Ag<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> with salts of silver). The lead salt is decomposed by a current of hydrogen
sulphide, when lead sulphide is precipitated, while the solution, evaporated under the
receiver of an air-pump, gives crystals of H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, which easily lose water and
give H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. The salts in which the H<sub>4</sub> is replaced by Ni<sub>2</sub>, or NiNa<sub>2</sub>, or CdNa<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.,
are insoluble in water.</p>

<p>In order to see the relation between phosphoric acid and hypophosphoric acid which
does not contain the elements of phosphorous acid (because it does not reduce either
gold or mercury from their solutions), but which nevertheless is capable of being oxidised
(for example, by potassium permanganate) into phosphoric acid, it is simplest to apply
the law of substitution. This clearly indicates the relation between oxalic acid, (COOH)<sub>2</sub>,
and carbonic acid, OH(COOH). The relation between the above acids is exactly the
same if we express phosphoric acid as OH(POO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), because in this case P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, or
(POO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, will correspond with it just as oxalic does with carbonic acid. A similar
relationship exists between hyposulphuric or dithionic acid, (SO<sub>2</sub>OH)<sub>2</sub>, and sulphuric
acid, OH(SO<sub>2</sub>OH), as we shall find in the following chapter. Dithionic acid corresponds
with the anhydride S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, intermediate between SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub>; oxalic acid with C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
intermediate between CO and CO<sub>2</sub>; hypophosphoric acid corresponds with the anhydride
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, intermediate between P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and the analogue of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>.</p></div>

established by Graham (<i>see</i> p. <a href="#Page_163">163</a>), is of such importance for the theory of hydrates and

thought has been far from exhausted. At the present time many such instances are
known both in organic (for instance, the difference between the reactions of the solutions
of certain anhydrides and hydrates of acids), and inorganic chemistry (for example, the
difference between the rose and purple cobalt compounds, Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_317">XXII.</a> &amp;c.) They

among inorganic substances are only considered as a simple difference in degrees of
affinity, distinguishing the water of constitution (hydration), crystallisation, and solution
without penetrating into the difference of the structure or distribution of the elements,
which exists here and gives rise to a distinct isomerism of solutions. In my opinion the
progress of chemistry, especially with regard to solutions, should make rapid strides when
the cause of the isomerism of solutions, for instance, of ortho- and pyrophosphoric acids,
has become as clear to us as the cause of many well-studied instances of the isomerism,
polymerism, and metamerism of organic compounds. Here it forms one of those many
important problems which remain for the chemistry of the future in a state of only
indistinct presentiments and in the form of facts empirically known but insufficiently

When heated it fuses like silver chloride, and if kept fused for some length of time
it gives a white pyrophosphate (the decomposition which causes this is not known).
It is soluble in aqueous solutions of phosphoric, nitric, and even acetic acids, of
ammonia, and many of its salts. If silver nitrate acts on a dimetallic orthophosphate&mdash;for
instance, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;it still gives Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, nitric acid being disengaged:
Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> + 3AgNO<sub>3</sub> = Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaNO<sub>3</sub> + HNO<sub>3</sub>. When alcohol is added to silver
orthophosphate, Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, dissolved in syrupy phosphoric acid, it precipitates a

Ag<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, which is immediately decomposed by water into the normal salt and phosphoric
acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_221" id="Footnote_16_221"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_221"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> The researches of Thomsen showed that in very dilute aqueous solutions the
majority of monobasic acids&mdash;nitric, acetic, hydrochloric, &amp;c. (but hydrofluoric acid more
and hydrocyanic less)&mdash;HX evolve the following amounts of heat (in thousands of calories)
with caustic soda: NaHO + 2HX = 14; NaHO + HX = 14; 2NaHO + HX = 14; that is, if
<i>n</i> be a whole number <i>n</i>NaHO + HX = 14 and NaHO + <i>n</i>HX = 14. Hence reaction here only
takes place between one molecule of NaHO and one molecule of acid, and the remaining
quantity of acid or alkali does not enter into the reaction. In the case of bibasic acids,
H<sub>2</sub>R&#8243; (sulphuric, dithionic, oxalic, sulphuretted hydrogen, &amp;c.), NaHO + 2H<sub>2</sub>R&#8243; = 14;
NaHO + H<sub>2</sub>R&#8243; = 14; 2NaHO + H<sub>2</sub>R&#8243; = 28; <i>n</i>NaHO + H<sub>2</sub>R&#8243; = 28; that is, with an excess of
acid (NaHO + 2H&#8242;<sub>2</sub>R&#8243;) 14 thousand units of heat are developed, and with an excess of alkali
28. When phosphoric acid is taken (but not all tribasic acids&mdash;for instance, not citric) the
general character of the phenomenon is similar to the preceding, namely, NaHO + 2H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
= 14·7; NaHO + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 14·8; 2NaHO + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 27·1; 3NaHO + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 34·0;
6NaHO + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 35·3; or, in general terms, NaHO + <i>n</i>H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 14 (approximately) and
<i>n</i>NaHO + H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = 35 and not 42, which shows a peculiarity of phosphoric acid. In the
case of energetic acids, when one equivalent (23 grams) of sodium (in the form of
hydroxide) replaces one equivalent (1 gram) of hydrogen (with the formation of water
and in dilute solutions), 14,000 heat units are evolved; and this is true for phosphoric
acid when in H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, Na or Na<sub>2</sub> replaces H or H<sub>2</sub>, but when Na<sub>3</sub> replaces H<sub>3</sub> less heat is
developed. This will be seen from the following scheme based on the preceding
figures: H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + NaHO = 14·8; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + NaHO = 12·3; Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> + NaHO = 5·9;
with Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + NaHO, a very small amount of heat is evolved, as may be judged from
the fact that Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + 3NaHO = 1·3, but still heat is evolved. It must be supposed
that in acting on phosphoric acid in the presence of a large quantity of water, a certain
portion of the sodium hydroxide remains as alkali uncombined with the acid. Thus, on
increasing the mass of the alkali, heat is still evolved, and a fresh interchange between
Na and H takes place. Hence water shows a decomposing action on the alkali phosphates.
The same decomposing action of water is seen, but to a less extent, with Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, as
may be judged both from the reactions of this salt and from the amount of heat
developed by NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> with NaHO. Such an explanation is in accordance with many
facts concerning the decomposition of salts by water already known to us. Recent
researches made by Berthelot and Louguinine have confirmed the above deductions made
by me in the first edition (1871) of this work. At the present time views of this nature are
somewhat generally accepted, although they are not sufficiently strictly applied in other
cases. As regards PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> it may be said that: on the substitution of the first hydrogen
this acid acts as a powerful acid (like HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>); on the substitution of the
second hydrogen as a weaker acid (like an organic acid); and on the substitution of
the third, as an alcohol, for instance phenol, having the properties of a feeble acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_223" id="Footnote_18_223"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_223"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The <i>ammonium orthophosphates</i> resemble the sodium salts in many respects, but
the instability of the di- and tri-metallic salts is seen in them still more clearly than in
the sodium salts; thus (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and even (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, lose ammonia in the air
(especially when heated, even in solutions); NH<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> alone does not disengage ammonia
and has an acid reaction. The crystals of the first salt contain 3H<sub>2</sub>O, and are only
formed in the presence of an excess of ammonia; both the others are anhydrous, and
may be obtained like the sodium salts. When ignited these salts leave metaphosphoric
acid behind; for example, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> = 2NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + HPO<sub>3</sub>. Ammonia also enters
into the composition of many double phosphates. Ammonium sodium orthophosphate,
or simply phosphate, NH<sub>4</sub>NaHPO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, crystallises in large transparent crystals from
a mixture of the solutions of disodium phosphate and ammonium chloride (in which
case sodium chloride is obtained in the mother liquid), or, better still, from a solution of
monosodium phosphate saturated with ammonia. It is also formed from the phosphates
in urine when it ferments. This salt is frequently used in testing metallic compounds
by the blow-pipe, because when ignited it leaves a vitreous metaphosphate, NaPO<sub>3</sub>,
which, like borax, dissolves metallic oxides, forming characteristic tinted glasses.</p>

<p>When a solution of trisodium phosphate is added to a solution of a magnesium salt it
gives a white precipitate of the normal orthophosphate Mg<sub>2</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O. If the trisodium
salt be replaced by the ordinary salt, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, a precipitate is also formed, and
MgHPO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O is obtained. It might be thought that the normal salt Mg<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> would
be precipitated if disodium phosphate was added to ammonia and a salt of magnesium, but
in reality <i>ammonium magnesium orthophosphate</i>, MgNH<sub>4</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, is precipitated as
a crystalline powder, which loses ammonia and water when ignited, and gives a pyrophosphate,
Mg<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. This salt occurs in nature as the mineral struvite, and in various
products of the changes of animal matter. If we consider that the above salt parts with
ammonia with difficulty, and that the corresponding salt of sodium is not formed under
the same conditions (MgNaPO<sub>4</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O is obtained by the action of magnesia on disodium
phosphate), if we turn our attention to the fact that the salts of calcium and barium do
not form double salts as easily as magnesium, and remember that the salts of magnesium
in general easily form double ammonium salts, we are led to think that this
salt is not really a normal, but an acid salt, corresponding with Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, in which Na<sub>2</sub>
is replaced by the equivalent group NH<sub>3</sub>Mg.</p>

<p>The common normal <i>calcium phosphate</i>, Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, occurs in minerals, in animals,
especially in bones, and also probably in plants, although the ash of many portions of
plants, as a rule, contains less lime than the formation of the normal salt requires. Thus
100 parts of the ash (from 5,000 parts of grain) of rye grain contain 47·5 of phosphoric
anhydride and only 2·7 of lime, and even the ash of the whole of the rye (including the
straw) contains twice as much phosphoric anhydride as lime, and the normal salt contains
almost equal weights of these substances. Only the ash of grasses, and especially of
clover, and of trees, contains in the majority of cases more lime than is required for the
formation of Ca<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. This salt, which is insoluble in water, dissolves even in such
feeble acids as acetic and sulphurous, and even in water containing carbonic acid. The
latter fact is of immense importance in nature, since by reason of it rain water is able to
transfer the calcium phosphates in the soil into solutions which are absorbed by plants.
The solubility of the normal salt in acids takes place by virtue of the formation of an
acid salt, which is evident from the quantity of acid required for its solution, and more
especially from the fact that the acid solutions when evaporated give crystalline scales
of the acid calcium phosphate, CaH<sub>4</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, soluble in water. This solubility of the acid
salt forms the basis of the treatment by acids of bones, phosphorites, guano, and other
natural products containing the normal salt and employed for fertilising the soil. The
perfect decomposition requires at least 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, but in reality less is taken,
so that only a portion of the normal salt is converted into the acid salt. Hydrochloric
acid is sometimes used. (In practice such mixtures are known as <i>superphosphates</i>).
Certain experiments, however, show that a thorough grinding, the presence of organic, and
especially of nitrogenous, substances, and the porous structure of some calcium phosphates
(for example, in burnt bones), render the treatment of phosphoric manures by acids superfluous&mdash;that
is, the crop is not improved by it.</p></div>

CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are meta-acids, or higher normal acids (NH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) with the loss of a
molecule of water.</p>

<p>In order to see the relation between the ortho-, pyro-, and metaphosphoric acids, the
first thing to remark in them is that the anhydride P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is combined with 3, 2, and 1
molecules of water. In the absence of data for the molecular weight of ortho- and pyrophosphoric
acids it is necessary to mention that all existing data for metaphosphoric acid
indicate (Note <a href="#Footnote_21_227">21</a>) that its molecule is much more complex and contains at least H<sub>3</sub>P<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>
or H<sub>6</sub>P<sub>6</sub>O<sub>18</sub>. The explanation of the problems which here present themselves can, it seems
to me, be only looked for after a detailed study of the phenomena of the polymerisations
of mineral substances, and of those complex acids, such as phosphomolybdic, which we
shall hereafter describe (Chapter <a href="#Page_276">XXI.</a>) A similar instance is exhibited in the solubility
of hydrate of silica (produced by the action of silicon fluoride on water) in fused metaphosphoric
acid, with the formation, on cooling, of an octahedral compound (sp. gr., 3·1)
containing SiO<sub>2</sub>,P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. A certain indication (but no proof) that ordinary orthophosphoric
acid is polymerised is given by Staudenmaier (1893), who obtained a salt,
K<sub>5</sub>H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, by the action of a solution of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> upon K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>; and a compound,
KH<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, corresponding to the doubled molecule of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, by the action of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
upon H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> itself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_226" id="Footnote_20_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_226"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The method of preparation of the acid itself consists in converting the sodium salt,
Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, by double decomposition with water and a salt of lead, into insoluble lead
pyrophosphate, Pb<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, which is then suspended in water and decomposed by sulphuretted
hydrogen; lead sulphide is thus precipitated, and pyrophosphoric acid remains in
solution. This solution cannot be heated, or the pyro-acid will pass into the ortho-, but
must be evaporated under the receiver of an air-pump. It concentrates to a syrup and
crystallises, and when ignited in this form loses water, and forms metaphosphoric acid.
It resembles orthophosphoric acid in many respects; its salts with the alkalis are also
soluble, and the others insoluble in water but soluble in acids. When heated in solution
with acid it gives orthophosphoric acid, as well as when fused with an excess of alkali.</p>

<p>Witt heated ammonium chloride with phosphoric acid (hydrochloric acid was evolved),
ignited the residue to drive off ammonia, and obtained pyrophosphoric acid in the
residue.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_227" id="Footnote_21_227"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_227"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> As when using phenolphthalein as an indicator in neutralising by an alkali metaphosphoric
acid is monobasic, and orthophosphoric acid is bibasic, it is possible by means
of this difference to follow the transition of meta- into orthophosphoric acid. Sabatier
(1888) carried on an investigation of this nature, and found that the rate of transformation
is dependent on the temperature, and is subject to the general laws of the rate of
chemical transformations which belongs to physical chemistry.</p>

<p>Metaphosphoric acid has a particular interest in respect to the variations to which
its salts are subject. The metaphosphates are formed by the ignition of the acid orthophosphates,
MH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, or MNH<sub>4</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, or of the acid pyrophosphates, M<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, or
M<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, water and ammonia being given off in the process. The properties of the
metaphosphates, which have a similar composition to nitrates&mdash;for instance, NaPO<sub>3</sub>, or
Ba(PO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&mdash;vary according to the duration of the ignition to which the ortho-, or pyrophosphates
from which they are prepared have been subjected. When the salts NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>
or NH<sub>4</sub>NaHPO<sub>4</sub> are strongly ignited, a salt NaPO<sub>3</sub> is formed, which deliquesces in the
air, and gives a gelatinous precipitate with salts of the alkaline earths. But, as Graham
(in 1830&ndash;40), and many others, especially Fleitmann and Henneberg (in 1840&ndash;50), and
Tamman (in the nineties), observed, under other conditions the salts of the same composition
acquire other properties. The above chemists recognise five polymeric forms of
metaphosphates, (HPO<sub>3</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>. We will follow the nomenclature and researches of Fleitmann.</p>

<p><i>Monometaphosphoric acid.</i> The salts are distinguished for their insolubility in
water; even the salts NaPO<sub>3</sub>, KPO<sub>3</sub>, are insoluble. They are obtained by igniting the
monometallic orthophosphates&mdash;for example, RH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;up to the temperature at which
all water is evolved (316°), but not to fusion. No double salts are known.</p>

<p><i>Dimetaphosphoric acid</i>, on the contrary, easily forms double salts&mdash;for example,
KNaP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, and also the copper potassium salt, &amp;c. The copper salt is obtained by evaporating
a solution of copper oxide in orthophosphoric acid. A blue ortho-salt, CuRHO<sub>4</sub>,
first separates from the solution, then a light-blue pyro-salt, Cu<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>; and above 350°,
when metaphosphoric acid itself begins to volatilise, the dimetaphosphate, CuP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, is
formed. The residue is washed with water, and decomposed with a hot solution of sodium
sulphide, when the sodium salt, Na<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, is obtained in solution. This salt, when evaporated
with alcohol, gives crystals containing 2 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O, which, however, retain their
solubility (in 7 parts of water) after the water is driven off at 100°. When fused, these
crystals give a deliquescent salt (hexa-metaphosphate). The solution of the salt has a
neutral reaction, which only after prolonged boiling becomes acid, owing to the formation
of orthophosphate, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The soluble salts of dimetaphosphoric acid give the
insoluble silver salt, Ag<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, with silver nitrate, and a precipitate of BaP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O
with barium chloride.</p>

<p><i>Trimetaphosphoric acid</i> is obtained as the sodium salt Na<sub>3</sub>P<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub> when any other
metaphosphate of sodium is fused and <i>slowly</i> cooled, then dissolved in a slight excess
of warm water, and the resultant solution evaporated. The crystals contain 6 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O,
and dissolve in four parts of water. An acid reaction is only obtained, as with the preceding
salt, after prolonged boiling with water. The acid is a true analogue of nitric
acid, because <i>all its metallic salts are soluble</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hexametaphosphoric acid.</i> Fleitmann so named the ordinary metaphosphoric acid
(glacial) which attracts moisture. The deliquescent sodium salt is obtained, like the trimetaphosphate,
only by <i>rapid</i> cooling. It is also formed by fusing silver oxide with
an excess of phosphoric acid. The sodium salt is soluble in water, and gives viscous,
elastic precipitates with salts of Ba, Ca, and Mg. Lubert (1893) obtained salts of Ag,
Pb, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Jawein and Thillot (1889), who investigated the sodium salts of metaphosphoric acid
by Raoult's method, came to the conclusion that the salts of di- and tri-metaphosphoric
acid behave in such a manner that their molecule must be represented as non-polymerised
NaPO<sub>3</sub>, whilst those of hexametaphosphoric acid behave as (NaPO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. At all events,
the series of salts which Fleitmann and Henneberg regard as monometaphosphates&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
as non-polymerised&mdash;are most probably the most polymerised, because they are insoluble.</p>

<p>According to Tamman's researches, vitreous metaphosphoric acid contains a mixture
consisting chiefly of two varieties, differing in the solubility and degree of stability of
their salts. The least stable corresponds to Fleitmann's hexa-acid, and gives three
isomeric salts. Tamman came to the conclusion that there exist polymers also in the
form of penta-, ortho-, and deca-metaphosphoric acids. Without going into details upon
this subject, I do not think it superfluous to point out that the undoubted capability of
metaphosphoric acid to polymerise should be connected with its faculty of combining
with water, whilst the degree of polymerisation and the number of polymeric forms
cannot yet be considered as sufficiently explained.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_BIS_228" id="Footnote_21_BIS_228"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_BIS_228"><span class="label">[21 bis]</span></a> The bibasity of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>, established by Würtz, has been proved by many direct
experiments (see, for instance, Note <a href="#Footnote_22_229">22</a>), among which we may mention that Amat (1892)
took a mixture of the aqueous solutions of Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>3</sub> and NaHO and added absolute
alcohol to it. Two layers were formed; the upper, alcoholic, contained all the excess
of NaHO, whilst the lower only contained the salt Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>3</sub>, which was therefore unable
to react with the excess of NaHO. Amat also obtained NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub> by saturating H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>
with soda until he obtained a neutral reaction with methyl-orange. The replacement
of one atom of H by sodium here, as in phosphoric acid (Note <a href="#Footnote_16_221">16</a>), gives more heat than
the replacement of the second atom. For the third atom there is no formation of a salt,
and therefore no evolution of heat. The monometallic salts&mdash;for example, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;or
the ammonia salts, when heated to 160°, give, as Amat had previously shown, a salt
of bibasic pyrophosphorous acid, Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_229" id="Footnote_22_229"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_229"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Phosphorous acid, when subjected to the action of nascent hydrogen (zinc and sulphuric
acid), evolves phosphine, and when boiled with an excess of alkali it evolves
hydrogen (PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3KHO = PK<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>); owing to its liability to oxidation, it is
a reducing agent&mdash;for instance, it reduces cupric chloride to cuprous chloride, and precipitates
silver from the nitrate and mercury from its salts.</p>

<p>These reactions are perhaps connected with the fact that in this acid one atom of
hydrogen should be considered as in the same condition as in phosphuretted hydrogen,
which is expressed by the formula PHO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, if we represent it as PH<sub>4</sub>X, with the substitution
of two of the hydrogen atoms by oxygen and of HX by two of hydroxyl. The
direct passage of phosphorous chloride into phosphorous acid would, however, indicate
that all the three atoms of hydrogen in it occur in the form of hydroxyl, because no
difference is known between the three atoms of chlorine in PCl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;they all react alike, as
a rule. However, Menschutkin, by acting on alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, with phosphorous chloride,
obtained hydrochloric acid and a substance P(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)Cl<sub>2</sub>, and from it by the action of
bromine he obtained ethyl bromide, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Br, and a compound PBrOCl<sub>2</sub>, which proves,
to a certain extent, the existence of a difference between the three atoms of chlorine in
phosphorous chloride. If we turn our attention to the formation of phosphine by the
ignition of phosphorous acid, we see that 4PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> only evolve 3H in the form of PH<sub>3</sub>,
and therefore the residue&mdash;that is, 3PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&mdash;will still contain one hydrogen of the
same nature as in phosphine, because in 4PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> we should recognise four such hydrogens
as in phosphine. We arrive at the same conclusion by examining the decomposition
of hypophosphorous acid, 2PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = PH<sub>3</sub> + PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. In the two molecules of the monobasic
hypophosphorous acid taken, there are only two atoms of hydrogen replaceable by
metals, whilst in the molecule of the resultant phosphoric acid there are three. Perhaps
relations of this nature determine the relative stability of the dimetallic salts of orthophosphoric
acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_231" id="Footnote_24_231"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_231"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Fluorine and bromine give PX<sub>3</sub> and PX<sub>5</sub>, like chlorine. With respect to iodine
PI<sub>5</sub> is, in a chemical sense, a very unstable substance, and generally <i>phosphorus tri-iodide</i>
only is formed (from yellow or red phosphorus and iodine in the requisite proportions).
It is a red crystalline substance, fuses at 55°, is easily decomposed by water,
forming phosphorous and hydriodic acids, and when heated it evolves iodine vapours
and forms phosphorus di-iodide, PI<sub>2</sub>. This substance may be obtained in the same
manner as the preceding by taking a smaller proportion of iodine (8 parts of iodine to
1 part of phosphorus, whilst the tri-iodide requires 12·3); it also forms red crystals, which
melt at 110°. When decomposed by water it not only gives phosphorous and hydriodic
acids, but also phosphine and a yellow substance (a lower oxide of phosphorus). In its
composition di-iodide of phosphorus corresponds with liquid phosphuretted hydrogen,
PH<sub>2</sub>, and probably its molecular weight is much higher: P<sub>2</sub>I<sub>4</sub> or P<sub>3</sub>I<sub>6</sub>, &amp;c. As the iodine
compounds of phosphorus give hydriodic and phosphorous acids with water, and as both
these substances are reducing agents in the presence of water (and hydrates), iodide of
phosphorus also acts as a reducing agent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_232" id="Footnote_25_232"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_232"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> In a liquid state the density of phosphorous chloride at 10° = 1·597, and therefore
its molecular volume = 137·5/1·597 = 86·0, and that of phosphorus oxychloride is equal to
153·5/1·693 = 90·7; hence the addition of oxygen has produced considerable increase in
volume, just as in the conversion of sulphur dichloride, SCl<sub>2</sub>, into sulphuryl chloride,
SOCl<sub>2</sub>, the volume changes from 64 to 71. It is the same with the boiling-points; phosphorus
trichloride boils at 70°, the oxychloride at 100°, sulphur dichloride at 64°, and
sulphuryl chloride at 78°&mdash;that is, the addition of oxygen raises the boiling points.</p>

<p><i>The vapour density</i> of phosphorus trichloride and oxychloride corresponds with their
formulæ (Cahours, Würtz)&mdash;namely, is equal to half the molecular weight referred to
hydrogen. But it is not so with phosphorus pentachloride. Cahours showed that the
vapour density of phosphorus pentachloride referred to air = 3·65, to hydrogen = 52·6,
whilst according to the formula PCl<sub>5</sub> it should be = 104·2. Hence this formula corresponds
with four, and not with two, molecules. This shows that the vapour of phosphoric
chloride contains two and not one molecule, that in a state of vapour it splits up, like
sal-ammoniac, sulphuric acid, &amp;c. The products of disruption must here be phosphorous
chloride, PCl<sub>3</sub>, and chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, bodies which easily re-form phosphoric chloride, PCl<sub>5</sub>,
at a lower temperature. This decomposition of phosphoric chloride in its conversion
into vapour is confirmed by the fact that the vapour of this almost colourless substance
shows the greenish-yellow colour proper to chlorine. This dissociation of phosphoric
chloride has been considered by some chemists as a sign that phosphorus, like nitrogen,
does not give volatile compounds of the type PX<sub>5</sub>, and that such substances are only
obtained as unstable molecular compounds which break up when distilled; for example,
PH<sub>3</sub>,HI, PCl<sub>3</sub>,Cl<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>,HCl, &amp;c. To prove that the molecule PCl<sub>5</sub> actually exists,
Würtz in 1870 observed that when mixed with the vapour of phosphorous chloride the
vapour of phosphoric chloride distils over (from 160° to 190°) perfectly colourless, and
has a density which is really near to the formula&mdash;namely, to 104&mdash;and the same density
was determined for the pentachloride in an atmosphere of chlorine. Hence at low
temperatures and in admixture with one of the products of dissociation, there is no
longer that decomposition which occurs at higher temperatures&mdash;that is, we have here a
case of dissociation proceeding at moderate temperatures.</p>

<p>An important proof in favour of the type PX<sub>5</sub> is exhibited by phosphorus pentafluoride
PF<sub>5</sub>, obtained by Thorpe as a colourless gas which only corrodes glass after
the lapse of time; it may be kept over mercury, and has a normal density. It is formed
when liquid arsenic trifluoride, AsF<sub>3</sub>, is added to phosphoric chloride surrounded by a
freezing mixture: 3PCl<sub>5</sub> + 5AsF<sub>3</sub> = 3PF<sub>5</sub> + 5AsCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>In general, fluorine and phosphorus give stable compounds: PF<sub>3</sub>, POF<sub>3</sub>, and PF<sub>5</sub>,
as would be expected from the fact that in passing from Cl to I (<i>i.e.</i> as the atomic
weight of the halogen increases) the stability of the compounds with P and the tendency
to give PX<sub>5</sub> (Note <a href="#Footnote_24_231">24</a>) decreases. <i>Phosphorus trifluoride</i> is obtained by heating a mixture
of ZnF<sub>2</sub> and PBr<sub>3</sub>, by the action of AsF<sub>3</sub> upon PCl<sub>3</sub>, by heating phosphide of copper
with PbF<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. It is a strong-smelling gas, which liquefies at -10° under a pressure
of 40 atmospheres, giving a colourless liquid. It dissolves easily in (is absorbed by,
reacts with) water, and acts upon glass; when mixed with Cl<sub>2</sub> it combines with it
(Poulenc, 1891), forming PCl<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>, a colourless gas of normal density, which is transformed
into a liquid at 8°, decomposes into PF<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> at 250°, and, with a small amount
of water, gives <i>oxy-fluoride</i> of phosphorus, POF<sub>3</sub> (with a large amount of water it gives
PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), which Moissan (1891) obtained by the action of dry HF upon P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and Thorpe
and Tutton (1890) by heating a mixture of cryolite and P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. It is a gas of normal
density, like PF<sub>3</sub>, and was obtained by Moissan by the action of fluorine upon PF<sub>3</sub>
(PSF<sub>3</sub>, <i>see</i> Chapter XX., Note <a href="#Footnote_20_286">20</a>). Thus the forms PX<sub>3</sub> and PX<sub>5</sub> not only exist in many
solid and non-volatile substances, but also as vapours.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_233" id="Footnote_26_233"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_233"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Phosphorus oxychloride is obtained by the action of phosphoric chloride on
hydrates of acids (because alkalis decompose phosphorus oxychloride), according to the
equation PCl<sub>5</sub> + RHO = POCl<sub>3</sub> + RCl + HCl, where RHO is an acid. The reaction only
proceeds according to this equation with monobasic acids, but then RCl is volatile, and
therefore a mixture is obtained of two volatile substances, the acid chloride and phosphorus
oxychloride, which are sometimes difficult to separate; whilst if the hydrate
be polybasic the reaction frequently proceeds so that an anhydride is formed:
RH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + PCl<sub>5</sub> = RO + POCl<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl. If the anhydride be non-volatile (like boric), or
easily decomposed (like oxalic), it is easy to obtain pure oxychloride. Thus phosphorus
oxychloride is often prepared by acting on boric or oxalic acid with phosphoric
chloride. It is also formed when the vapour of phosphoric chloride is passed over
phosphoric anhydride, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 3PCl<sub>5</sub> = 5POCl<sub>3</sub>. This forms an excellent example in proof
of the fact that the formation of one substance from two does not necessarily show that
the resultant compound contains the molecules of these substances in its molecule. But
other oxychlorides of phosphorus are also formed by the interaction of phosphoric anhydride
and chloride; thus at 200° the chloranhydride, PO<sub>2</sub>Cl, or chloranhydride of metaphosphoric
acid, is formed (Gustavson). The chloranhydride of pyrophosphoric acid,
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>, was obtained (Hayter and Michaelis), together with NOCl, &amp;c., by the action
of NO upon cold PCl<sub>3</sub>, as a fuming liquid boiling at 210°.</p></div>

reaction between carbonic oxide and chlorine, but when once started it will proceed
rapidly in diffused light. An excess of chlorine (which gives its coloration to the
colourless phosgene) aids the completion of the reaction, and may afterwards be removed
by metallic antimony. Porous substances, like charcoal, aid the reaction. Phosgene
may be prepared by passing a mixture of carbonic anhydride and chlorine over incandescent
charcoal. Lead or silver chloride, when heated in a current of carbonic oxide,
also partially form phosgene gas. Carbon tetrachloride, CCl<sub>4</sub>, also forms it when heated
with carbonic anhydride (at 400°), with phosphoric anhydride (200°), and most easily of all
with sulphuric anhydride (2SO<sub>3</sub> + CCl<sub>4</sub> = COCl<sub>2</sub> + S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, this is pyrosulphuryl chloride).
Chloroform, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, is converted into carbonyl chloride when heated with SO<sub>2</sub>(OH)Cl
(the first chloranhydride of sulphuric acid); CHCl<sub>3</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub>HCl = COCl<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl
(Dewar), and when oxidised by chromic acid.</p>

acids&mdash;for instance, BCl<sub>3</sub>, and SiCl<sub>4</sub>&mdash;and here we shall describe those which correspond
with sulphuric acid in the following chapter. It may be mentioned here that when hydrochloric
acts on nitric acid (aqua regia, Vol. I. p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_467">467</a>) there is formed, besides chlorine,
the oxychlorides NOCl and NO<sub>2</sub>Cl, which may be regarded as chloranhydrides of nitric
and nitrous acids (nitrogen chloride, Vol. I. p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_476">476</a>). The former boils at -5°, the latter
at +5°, the specific gravity of the first at -12° = 1·416, and at -18° = 1·433 (Geuther),
and of the second = 1·3; the first is obtained from nitric oxide and chlorine, the second
from nitric peroxide and chlorine, and also by the action of phosphoric chloride on nitric
acid. If the gases evolved by aqua regia be passed into cold and strong sulphuric acid,
they form crystals of the composition NHSO<sub>3</sub> (like chamber crystals), which melt at 86°,
and with sodium chloride form acid sodium sulphate and the oxychloride NOCl. This
chloranhydride of nitric acid is termed <i>nitrosyl chloride</i>.</p>

<p><i>Cyanogen chloride</i>, CNCl, is the gaseous chloranhydride of cyanic acid; it is formed
by the action of chlorine on aqueous mercury cyanide, Hg(CN)<sub>2</sub> + 2Cl<sub>2</sub> = HgCl<sub>2</sub> + 2CNCl.
When chlorine acts on cyanic acid, it forms not only this cyanogen chloride, but also polymerides
of it&mdash;a liquid, boiling at 18°, and a solid, boiling at 190°. The latter corresponds
with cyanuric acid, and consequently contains C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>. Details concerning these
substances must be looked for in works on organic chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_BIS_236" id="Footnote_28_BIS_236"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_BIS_236"><span class="label">[28 bis]</span></a> This reaction indeed proceeds very easily and completely with a number of
hydroxides, if they do not react on hydrochloric acid and phosphorus oxychloride, which
is the case when they have alkaline properties. When the hydroxide is bibasic and
is present in excess, it not unfrequently happens that the elements of water are taken
up: R(OH)<sub>2</sub> + PCl<sub>5</sub> = RO + 2HCl + POCl<sub>3</sub>. The anhydride RO may then be converted
into chloranhydride, RO + PCl<sub>5</sub> = RCl<sub>2</sub> + POCl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, phosphorus pentachloride
brings about the substitution of O by Cl<sub>2</sub>. Thus carbonyl chloride, COCl<sub>2</sub>, boron
chloride, 2BCl<sub>3</sub>, and succinic chloride, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., are respectively obtained by the
action of phosphoric chloride on carbonic, boric, and succinic anhydrides. Phosphorus
pentachloride reacts in a similar manner on the aldehydes, RCHO, forming RCHCl<sub>2</sub>,
and on the chloranhydrides themselves&mdash;for example, with acetic chloride, CH<sub>3</sub>.COCl
(when heated in a closed tube), it forms a substance having the composition CH<sub>3</sub>CCl<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Phosphorus trichloride and oxychloride act in a similar manner to phosphoric chloride.
When phosphorus trichloride acts on an acid, 3RHO + PCl<sub>3</sub> = 3RCl + P(HO)<sub>3</sub>. If a salt
is taken, then by the action of phosphorus oxychloride a corresponding chloranhydride
and salt of orthophosphoric acid are easily formed: 3R(KO) + POCl<sub>3</sub> = 3RCl + PO(KO)<sub>3</sub>.
The chloranhydride RCl is always more volatile than its corresponding acid, and distils
over before the hydrate RHO. Thus acetic acid boils at 117°, and its chloranhydride
at 50°. Phosphoric and phosphorous acids are very slightly volatile, whilst their
chloranhydrides are comparatively easily converted into vapour. The faculty of the
chloranhydrides to react at the expense of their own chlorine determines their great
importance in chemistry. For instance, suppose we require to know the molecular
formula of some hydrate which does not pass into a state of vapour and does not give a
chloranhydride with hydrochloric acid&mdash;that is, which has not any basic or alkaline
properties; we must then endeavour to obtain this chloranhydride by means of
phosphoric chloride, and it frequently happens that the corresponding chloranhydride is
volatile. The resultant chloranhydride is then converted into vapour, and its composition
is determined; and if we know its composition we are able to decide that of its
corresponding hydrate. Thus, for example, from the formula of silicon chloride, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, or
of boron chloride, BCl<sub>3</sub>, we can judge the composition of their corresponding hydrates,
Si(HO)<sub>4</sub>, B(HO)<sub>3</sub>. Having obtained the chloranhydride RCl or RCl<sub><i>n</i></sub>, it is possible by its
means to obtain many other compounds of the same radicle R according to the equation
MX + RCl = MCl + RX. M may be = H, K, Ag, or other metal. The reaction proceeds
thus if M forms a stable compound with chlorine&mdash;for example, silver chloride, hydrochloric
acid, and R, an unstable substance. Hence, a chloranhydride is frequently
employed for the formation of other compounds of a given radicle; for instance, with
ammonia they form amides RNH<sub>2</sub>, and with salts ROK, with anhydrides R<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_237" id="Footnote_29_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_237"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The reaction of ammonia on phosphorus pentachloride is more complex than the
preceding. This is readily understood: to the oxychloride, POCl<sub>3</sub>, tere corresponds a
hydrate PO(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and a salt PO(NH<sub>4</sub>O)<sub>3</sub>, and consequently also an amide PO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,
whilst the pentachloride, PCl<sub>5</sub>, has no corresponding hydrate P(OH)<sub>5</sub>, and therefore there
is no amide P(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>. The reaction with ammonia will be of two kinds: either instead of
5 mol. NH<sub>3</sub>, only 3 mol. NH<sub>3</sub> or still less will act; <i>i.e.</i> PCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, PCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. are
formed; or else the pentachloride will act like a mixture of chlorine with the trichloride,
and then as the result there will be obtained the products of the action of chlorine on those
amides which are formed from phosphorus trichloride and ammonia. It would appear
that both kinds of reaction proceed simultaneously, but both kinds of products are unstable,
at all events complex, and in the result there is obtained a mixture containing
sal-ammoniac, &amp;c. The products of the first kind should react with water, and we should
obtain, for example, PCl<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = 3HCl and PO(HO)(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. This substance has
not actually been obtained, but the compound PONH(NH<sub>2</sub>) derived from it by elimination
of the elements of water is known, and is termed <i>diphosphamide</i>; it is, however, more
probable that it is a nitrile than an amide, because only amides contain the group NH<sub>2</sub>.
It is a colourless, stable, insoluble powder, which possibly corresponds with pyrophosphoric
acid, more especially since when heated it evolves ammonia and gives and leaves
phosphoryl nitride, PON&mdash;that is, the nitrile of metaphosphoric acid. The amide corresponding
with the pyrophosphate P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> should be P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, and the nitriles
corresponding to the latter would be P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>N(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>ON<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>). The
composition of the first is the same as that of the above diphosphamide. The third
pyrophosphoric nitrile has a formula P<sub>2</sub>N<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, and this is the composition of the body
known as <i>phospham</i>, PHN<sub>2</sub> (in a certain sense this is the analogue of N<sub>3</sub>H polymerised,
Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_246">VI.</a>) Indeed, phospham has been obtained by heating the products of the action
of ammonia on phosphoric chloride, as an insoluble and alkaline powder, which gives
ammonia and phosphoric acid when subjected to the action of water. The same substance
is obtained by the action of ammonium chloride on phosphoric chloride (PNCl<sub>2</sub> is
first formed, and reacts further with ammonia, forming phospham), and by igniting the
mass which is formed by the action of ammonia on phosphorus trichloride. Formerly the
composition of phospham was supposed to be PHN<sub>2</sub>, now there is reason to think that its
molecular weight is P<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>The above compounds correspond with normal salts, but nitriles and amides corresponding
to acid salts are also possible, and they will be acids. For example, the amide
PO(HO)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>), and its nitrile, will be either PN(HO)<sub>2</sub> or PO(HO)(NH), but at all
events of the composition PNH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and having acid properties. The ammonium salt of
this <i>phosphonitrilic acid</i> (it is called phosphamic acid), PNH(NH<sub>4</sub>)O<sub>2</sub>, is obtained by
the action of ammonia on phosphoric anhydride, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 4NH_3 = H<sub>2</sub>O + 2PNH(NH<sub>4</sub>)O<sub>2</sub>.
A non-crystalline soluble mass is thus formed, which is dissolved in a dilute solution of
ammonia and precipitated with barium chloride, and the resultant barium salt is then
decomposed with sulphuric acid, and thus a solution of the acid of the above composition
is obtained.</p>

<p>It is evident from the theory of the formation of amides and nitriles (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_379">IX.</a>)
that very many compounds of this kind can correspond with the acids of phosphorus;
but as yet only a few are known. The easy transitions of the ortho-, meta-, and pyrophosphoric
acids, by means of the hydrogen of ammonia, into the lower acids, and conversely,
tend to complicate the study of this very large class of compounds, and it is rarely
that the nature of a product thus obtained can be judged from its composition; and this
all the more that instances of isomerism and polymerism, of mixture between water of
crystallisation and of constitution, &amp;c., are here possible. Many data are yet needed
to enable us to form a true judgment as to the composition and structure of such
compounds. As the best proof of this we will describe the very interesting and most
fully investigated compound of this class, PNCl<sub>2</sub>, called <i>chlorophosphamide</i>, or nitrogen
chlorophosphorite. It is formed in small quantities when the vapour of phosphoric
chloride is passed over ignited sal-ammoniac. Besson (1892) heated the compound
PCl<sub>5</sub>8NH<sub>3</sub> (which is easily and directly formed from PCl<sub>5</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>) under a pressure of
about 50 mm. (of mercury) to 200°, and obtained brilliant crystals of PNCl<sub>2</sub>, which melted
at 106° (in the residue after the distillation of sal-ammoniacal phospham). The chlorine
in it is very stable&mdash;quite different from that in phosphoric chloride. Indeed, the resultant
substance is not only insoluble in water (though soluble in alcohol and ether), but
it is not even moistened by it, and distils over, together with steam, without being decomposed.
In a free state it easily crystallises in colourless prisms, fuses at 114°, boils at 250°
(Gladstone, Wichelhaus), and when fused with potash gives potassium chloride and the
amidonitrile of phosphoric acid. Judging from its formula and the simplicity of its composition
and reactions, it might be thought that the molecular weight of this substance
would be expressed by the formula PCl<sub>2</sub>N, that it corresponds with PON and with PCl<sub>5</sub>
(like POCl_3), with the substitution of Cl_3 by N, just as in POCl_3 two atoms of chlorine
are replaced by oxygen; but all these surmises are incorrect, because its vapour density
(referred to hydrogen&mdash;Gladstone, Wichelhaus) = 182&mdash;that is, the molecular formula
must be three times greater, P<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>. The polymerisation (tripling) is here of exactly
the same kind as with the nitriles.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_238" id="Footnote_30_238"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_238"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> It is necessary to remark that, although arsenic is so closely analogous to phosphorus
(especially in the higher forms of combination, RX<sub>3</sub> and RX<sub>5</sub>), at the same time
it exhibits a certain resemblance and even isomorphism with the corresponding compounds
of sulphur (especially the metallic compounds of the type MAs, corresponding
with MS). Thus compounds containing metals, arsenic, and sulphur are very frequently
met with in nature. Sometimes the relative amounts of arsenic and sulphur vary, so
that an isomorphous substitution between the arsenides and sulphides must be recognised.
Besides FeS<sub>2</sub> (ordinary pyrites), and FeAs<sub>2</sub>, iron forms an arsenical pyrites containing
both sulphur and arsenic, which from its composition, FeAsS or FeS<sub>2</sub>FeAs<sub>2</sub>,
resembles the two preceding.</p></div>

variety of metallic arsenic, whilst the brown product which is formed together with it in
Marsh's apparatus is a lower hydride AsH. Schuller and McLeod (1894), however, recognise
a peculiar yellow variety of arsenic.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_240" id="Footnote_31_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_240"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Hydrochloric acid dissolves arsenious anhydride in considerable quantities, and
this is probably owing to the formation of unstable compounds in which the arsenious
anhydride plays the part of a base. A compound called <i>arsenious oxychloride</i>, having
the composition AsOCl, is even known. It is formed when arsenious anhydride is added
little by little to boiling arsenic trichloride, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + AsCl<sub>3</sub> = 3AsOCl. It is a transparent
substance, which fumes in air, and combines with water to form a crystalline mass having
the composition As<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. When heated it decomposes into arsenious chloride and
a fresh oxychloride of a more complex composition, As<sub>6</sub>O<sub>8</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>· Arsenic trichloride, when
treated with a small quantity of water, forms the crystalline compound, As<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,
mentioned above. These compounds resemble the basic salts of bismuth and aluminium.
The existence of these compounds shows that arsenic is of a more metallic
or basic character than phosphorus. Nevertheless <i>arsenic trichloride</i>, AsCl<sub>3</sub>, resembles
phosphorus trichloride in many respects. It is obtained by the direct action of chlorine
on arsenic, or by distilling a mixture of common salt, sulphuric acid, and arsenious anhydride.
The latter mode of preparation already indicates the basic properties of the oxide.
Arsenious chloride is a colourless oily liquid, boiling at 130°, and having a sp. gr. of 2·20. It
fumes in air like other chloranhydrides, but it is much more slowly and imperfectly decomposed
by water than phosphorus trichloride. A considerable quantity of water is required
for its complete decomposition into hydrochloric acid and arsenious anhydride. It forms
an excellent example of the transition from true metallic chlorides to true chloranhydrides
of the acids. It hardly combines with chlorine, <i>i.e.</i> if AsCl<sub>5</sub> is formed it is very unstable.
<i>Arsenic tribromide</i>, AsBr<sub>3</sub>, is formed as a crystalline substance, fusing at 20° and boiling
at 220°, by the direct action of metallic arsenic on a solution of bromine in carbon
bisulphide, the latter being then evaporated. The specific gravity of arsenic tribromide
is 3·36. Crystalline arsenic tri-iodide, AsI<sub>3</sub>, having a sp. gr. 4·39, may be obtained in a
like manner; it may be dissolved in water, and on evaporation separates out from the
solution in an anhydrous state&mdash;that is, it is not decomposed&mdash;and consequently behaves
like metallic salts. <i>Arsenic trifluoride</i>, AsF<sub>3</sub>, is obtained by heating fluor spar and
arsenious anhydride with sulphuric acid. It is a fuming, colourless, and very poisonous
liquid, which boils at 63° and has a sp. gr. of 2·73. It is decomposed by water. It is very
remarkable that fluorine forms a pentafluoride of arsenic also, although this compound
has not yet been obtained in a separate state, but only in combination with potassium
fluoride. This compound, K<sub>3</sub>AsF<sub>8</sub>, is formed as prismatic crystals when potassium
arsenate, K<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>, is dissolved in hydrofluoric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_241" id="Footnote_32_241"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_241"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> <i>Arsenic acid</i>, H<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>, corresponding with orthophosphoric acid, is formed by
oxidising arsenious anhydride with nitric acid, and evaporating the resultant solution
until it attains a sp. gr. of 2·2; on cooling it separates in crystals having the above
composition. This hydrate corresponds with the normal salts of arsenic acid; but on
dissolving in water (without heating), and on cooling a strong solution, crystals containing
a greater amount of water, namely, (AsH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, separate. This water, like water of
crystallisation, is very easily expelled at 100°. At 120° crystals having a composition
identical with that of pyrophosphoric acid, As<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, separate, but water, on dissolving
this hydrate with the development of heat, forms a solution in no way differing from a
solution of ordinary arsenic acid, so that it is not an independent pyroarsenic acid that
is formed. Neither is there any true analogue of metaphosphoric acid, although the
compound AsHO<sub>3</sub> is formed at 200°, and on solidifying forms a mass having a pearly
lustre and sparingly soluble in cold water; but on coming into contact with warm water
it becomes very hot, and gives ordinary orthoarsenic acid in solution. Arsenic acid
forms three series of salts, which are perfectly analogous to the three series of orthophosphates.
Thus the normal salt, K<sub>3</sub>AsO<sub>4</sub>, is formed by fusing the other potassium
arsenates with potassium carbonate; it is soluble in water and crystallises in needles
which do not contain water. Di-potassium arsenate, K<sub>2</sub>HAsO<sub>4</sub>, is formed in solution
by mixing potassium carbonate and arsenic acid until carbonic anhydride ceases to be
evolved; it does not crystallise, and has an alkaline reaction; hence it corresponds
perfectly with the sodium phosphate. As was mentioned above, arsenic acid itself
acts as an oxidising agent; for example, it is used in the manufacture of aniline dyes
for oxidising the aniline, and it is prepared in large quantities for this purpose.
When sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through its solution, sulphuric acid and
arsenious anhydride are obtained in solution. Arsenic acid is very easily soluble in
water, and its solution has an exceedingly acid reaction, and when boiled with hydrochloric
acid evolves chlorine, like selenic, chromic, manganic, and certain other higher
metallic acids.</p>

<p><i>Arsenic anhydride</i>, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, is produced when arsenic acid is heated to redness. It
must be carefully heated, as at a bright red heat it decomposes into oxygen and arsenious
anhydride. Arsenic anhydride is an amorphous substance almost entirely insoluble in
water, but it attracts moisture from the air, deliquesces, and passes into the acid. Hot
water produces this transformation with great ease.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_242" id="Footnote_33_242"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_242"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The formation of arseniuretted hydrogen is accompanied by the absorption of 37,000
heat units, while phosphine evolves 18,000 (Ogier), and ammonia 27,000. Sodium (0·6 p.c.)
amalgam, with a strong solution of As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, gives a gas containing 86 vols. of arsenic and
14 vols. of hydrogen (Cavazzi).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_243" id="Footnote_34_243"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_243"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> This spot, or the metallic ring which is deposited on the heated tube, may easily be
tested as to whether it is really due to arsenic or proceeds from some other substance
reduced in the hydrogen flame&mdash;for instance, carbon or antimony. The necessity for distinguishing
arsenic from antimony is all the more frequently encountered in medical
jurisprudence, from the fact that preparations of antimony are very frequently used as
medicine, and antimony behaves in the hydrogen apparatus just like arsenic, and therefore
in making an investigation for poisoning by arsenic it is easy to mistake it for
antimony. The best method to distinguish between the metallic spots of arsenic and
antimony is to test them with a solution of sodium hypochlorite, free from chlorine, because
this will dissolve arsenic and not antimony. Such a solution is easily obtained by
the double decomposition of solutions of sodium carbonate and bleaching powder. A
solution of potassium chlorate acts in the same manner, only more slowly. Further
particulars must be looked for in analytical works.</p>

<p>Arseniuretted hydrogen, like phosphuretted hydrogen, is only slightly soluble in water,
has no alkaline properties&mdash;that is, it does not combine with acids&mdash;and acts as a
reducing agent. When passed into a solution of silver nitrate it gives a blackish brown
precipitate of metallic silver, the arsenic being oxidised. If acting on copper sulphate
and similar salts, arseniuretted hydrogen sometimes forms arsenides&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it reduces the
metallic salt with its hydrogen, and is itself reduced to arsenic. Sulphuric, and even
hydrochloric, acid reduces arseniuretted hydrogen to arsenic, and it is still more easily
decomposed by arsenious chloride, and with phosphorous chloride it gives the compound
PAs. Arseniuretted hydrogen gives metallic arsenic with an acid solution of arsenious
anhydride (Tivoli).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_244" id="Footnote_35_244"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_244"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> According to Mitscherlich's determination, the vapour density of arsenious anhydride
is 199 (H = 1)&mdash;that is, it answers to the molecular formula As<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. Probably this is connected
with the fact that the molecule of free arsenic contains As<sub>4</sub>. V. Meyer and Biltz,
however, showed (1889) that at a temperature of about 1,700° the vapour density of arsenic
corresponds with the molecule As<sub>2</sub>, and not As<sub>4</sub>, as at lower temperatures.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_245" id="Footnote_36_245"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_245"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Arsenious anhydride is obtained in an amorphous form after prolonged heating at
a temperature near to that at which it volatilises, or, better still, by heating it in a closed
vessel. It then fuses to a colourless liquid, which on cooling forms a transparent vitreous
mass, whose specific gravity is only slightly less than that of the crystalline anhydride.
On cooling, this vitreous mass undergoes an internal change, in which it crystallises
and becomes opaque, and acquires the appearance of porcelain. The following difference
between the vitreous and opaque varieties is very remarkable: when the vitreous variety
is dissolved in strong and hot hydrochloric acid it gives crystals of the anhydride on
cooling, and this crystallisation <i>is accompanied by the emission of light</i> (which is visible
in the dark), and the entire liquid glows as the crystals begin to separate. The opaque
variety does not emit light when the crystals separate from its hydrochloric acid solution.
It is also remarkable that the vitreous variety passes into the opaque form when it is
pounded&mdash;that is, under the action of a series of blows. Thus, several varieties of
arsenious anhydride are known, but as yet they are not characterised by any special
chemical distinctions, and even differ but little in their specific gravities, so that it cannot
be said that the above differences are due to any isomeric transformation&mdash;that is, to an
arrangement of the atoms in the molecule&mdash;but probably only depend on a difference in
the distribution of the molecules, or, in other terms, are physical and not chemical
variations. One part of the vitreous anhydride requires twelve parts of boiling water
for its solution, or twenty-five parts at the ordinary temperature. The opaque variety is
less soluble, and at the ordinary temperature requires about seventy parts of water for
its solution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_246" id="Footnote_37_246"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_246"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Arsenious anhydride does not oxidise in air, either in a dry state or in solution,
but in the presence of alkalis it absorbs oxygen from the air, and acts as an excellent
reducing agent. This probably is connected with the fact that arsenic acid is much
more energetic than arsenious acid, and that it is arsenic acid which is formed by the
oxidation of the latter in the presence of alkalis. Arsenious anhydride is easily reduced
to arsenic by many metals, even by copper.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_247" id="Footnote_38_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_247"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> The feebleness of the acid properties of arsenious anhydride is seen in the fact that if
it be dissolved in ammonia water, and then a still stronger solution of ammonia be added,
prismatic crystals separate having the composition of ammonium metarsenite, NH<sub>4</sub>AsO<sub>3</sub>.
This ammonium salt deliquesces in air, and loses all its ammonia. The magnesium salt
is tri-metallic, Mg<sub>3</sub>(AsO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; it is insoluble in water, and is formed by mixing an ammoniacal
solution of arsenious anhydride with an ammoniacal solution of a magnesium salt.
It is insoluble even in ammonia, although it dissolves in an excess of acids. Magnesium
hydroxide gives the same salt with arsenious solutions, and hence magnesia is one of
the best antidotes for arsenic poisoning. <i>The arsenites of copper</i> are much used in
the manufacture of colours, more especially of pigments. They are distinguished by
their insolubility in water and by their remarkably vivid green colour, but at the same
time by their poisonous character. Not only do such pigments applied to wall papers or
other materials easily dust off from them, but they give exhalations containing AsH<sub>3</sub>. The
cupric salts, CuX<sub>2</sub>, when mixed with an alkaline solution of arsenious acid, give a green
precipitate of a copper salt called <i>Scheele's green</i>. Its composition is probably CuHAsO<sub>3</sub>.
Ammonia dissolves it, and gives a colourless solution, containing cuprous arsenate&mdash;that
is, the cupric compound is reduced and the arsenic subjected to a further oxidation.
The so-called <i>Schweinfurt green</i> was still more used, especially in former times; it is
an insoluble green cupric salt, which resembles the preceding in many respects, but
has a different tint. It is prepared by mixing boiling solutions of arsenious acid and
cupric acetate. Arsenious acid forms an insoluble compound with ferric hydroxide, resembling
the phosphate; and this is the reason why freshly precipitated oxide of iron is
employed as an <i>antidote for arsenic</i>. The freshly precipitated oxide of iron, taken immediately
after poisoning by arsenic, converts the arsenious acid into an insoluble state,
by forming a compound on which the acids of the stomach have no action, so that the
poisoning cannot proceed. It is remarkable that the inhabitants of certain mountainous
countries accustom themselves to taking arsenic, as a means which, according to
their experience, helps to overcome the fatigue of mountain ascents. Arsenious anhydride
and certain of its salts are also used in medicine, naturally only in small quantities.
When taken internally arsenic passes into the blood, and is mainly excreted by the
urine.</p></div>

soluble arsenious and arsenic acids, and remains in solution. The purest antimony is
easily obtained from tartar emetic, by heating it with a small quantity of nitre. Metallic
antimony also occurs, although rarely, native; and as it is very easily obtained, it was

SbO(SbO<sub>3</sub>) = Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Oxide of antimony is also formed when antimonic acid is
ignited; it then loses water and oxygen, and gives this intermediate oxide as a white
infusible powder, of sp. gr. 6·7. It is somewhat soluble in water, and gives a solution
which turns litmus paper red.</p></div>

to the conclusion that it is monobasic, but all the salts still contain water, so that their
general type is mostly: MSbO<sub>3</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O, for example, M = Li, Hg (salts of the suboxide),
&frac12; Pb, &amp;c. The type of the ortho-salts, M<sub>2</sub>SbO<sub>4</sub>, is quite unknown, although it is reproduced
in the thio-compounds, for instance, Schlippe's salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SbS<sub>4</sub>, but this salt also contains
water of crystallisation, 9H<sub>2</sub>O (Chapter XX., Note <a href="#Footnote_29_295">29</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_253" id="Footnote_42_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_253"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Among the other compounds of antimony, <i>antimoniuretted hydrogen</i>, SbH<sub>3</sub>, resembles
arseniuretted hydrogen in its mode of formation and properties (it splits up at
150°, Brunn 1890; when liquified, it boils at -65° and solidifies at -92°), whilst the halogen
compounds differ in many respects from those of arsenic. When chlorine is passed over
an excess of antimony powder, it forms <i>antimony trichloride</i>, SbCl<sub>3</sub>, but if the chlorine
be in excess it forms the <i>pentachloride</i>, SbCl<sub>5</sub>. The trichloride is a crystalline substance
which melts at 72° and distils at 230°, whilst the pentachloride is a yellow
liquid, which splits up into chlorine and the trichloride when heated; at 140° it begins
to give off chlorine abundantly, carrying away the vapour of the trichloride with it; and
at 200° the decomposition is complete, and pure antimonious chloride only passes over.
This property of antimony pentachloride has caused it to be applied in many cases for
the transference of chlorine; all the more that when it has given up its chlorine, it
leaves the trichloride, which is able to absorb a fresh amount of chlorine; and therefore
many substances which are unable to react directly with gaseous chlorine do so with
antimony pentachloride, and in the presence of a small quantity of it chlorine will act on
them, just as oxygen is able, in the presence of nitrogen oxides, to oxidise substances
which could not be oxidised by means of free oxygen. Thus carbon bisulphide is not
acted on by chlorine at low temperatures&mdash;this reaction requires a high temperature&mdash;but
in the presence of antimony pentachloride its conversion into carbon tetrachloride
takes place at low temperatures. Antimony tri- and pentachloride, having the
character of chloranhydrides, fume in air, attract moisture, and are decomposed by
water, forming antimonious and antimonic acids. But in the first action of water the
trichloride does not evolve all its chlorine as hydrochloric acid, which is intelligible in
view of the fact that antimonious anhydride is also a base, and is therefore able to
react with acids; indeed antimony sulphide dissolved in an excess of hydrochloric acid
(hydrogen sulphide is evolved) gives an aqueous solution of antimony trichloride, which,
when carefully distilled, even gives the anhydrous compound. Antimony trichloride is
only decomposed by an excess of water, and then not completely, for with a large quantity
of water it forms <i>powder of algaroth</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> antimony oxychloride. The first action of
water consists in the formation of <i>oxychloride</i>, SbOCl&mdash;that is, a salt corresponding to
oxide of antimony as a base. If antimony oxide or antimony chloride be dissolved in an
excess of hydrochloric acid, and the solution diluted with a considerable amount of
water, then this same powder of algaroth is precipitated. The composition varies with
the relative amount of water; namely, between the limits SbOCl and Sb<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The
latter compound is, as it were, a basic salt of the former, because its composition
= 2(SbOCl)Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>With bromine and iodine, antimony forms compounds similar to those with chlorine.
Antimonious bromide, SbBr<sub>3</sub>, crystallises in colourless prisms, melts at 94°, and boils at
270°; antimonious iodide, SbI<sub>3</sub>, forms red crystals of sp. gr. 5·0; antimony trifluoride,
SbF<sub>3</sub> separates from a solution of antimonious oxide in hydrofluoric acid, and SbF<sub>5</sub> is
formed by a similar treatment of antimonic acid. The latter gives easily-soluble double
salts with the fluorides of the metals of the alkalis.</p>

<p>De Haën (1887) obtained very stable double soluble salts, SbF<sub>3</sub>,KCl (100 parts of
water dissolve 57 parts of salt), SbF<sub>3</sub>,K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c., which he proposed to make use of in
the arts as very easily crystallisable and soluble salts of antimony.</p>

<p>Engel, by passing hydrochloric acid gas into a saturated solution of antimonious
chloride at 0°, obtained a compound HCl,2SbCl<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and with the pentachloride a
compound SbCl<sub>5</sub>,5HCl,10H<sub>2</sub>O. Bismuth trichloride, BiCl<sub>3</sub>, gives a similar compound.</p>

<p>Saunders (1892) obtained 5RbCl,3SbCl<sub>3</sub> and RbCl,SbCl<sub>3</sub>. Ditte and Metzner (1892)
showed that Sb and Bi dissolve in hydrochloric acid only owing to the participation of
the oxygen of the air or of that dissolved in the acid.</p></div>

or BiHO<sub>3</sub>, known as bismuthic acid, and the pyrohydrate, Bi<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. <i>Bismuth pentoxide</i>
is obtained by the prolonged passage of chlorine through a boiling solution of potassium
hydroxide (sp. gr. 1·38), containing bismuth oxide in suspension; the precipitate is
washed with water, with boiling nitric acid (but not for long, as otherwise the bismuthic
acid is decomposed), then again with water, and finally the resultant bright red powder of
the hydrate BiHO<sub>3</sub> is dried at 125°. The prolonged action of nitric acid on bismuthic
anhydride, Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, results in the formation of the compound Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, which decomposes
in moist air, forming Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The density of bismuthic anhydride is 5·10, of the tetroxide,
Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, 3·60, and of bismuthic acid, BiHO<sub>3</sub>, 5·75. <i>Pyrobismuthic acid</i>, Bi<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, forms
a brown powder, which loses a portion of its water at 150°, and decomposes on further
heating, with the evolution of oxygen and water. It is obtained by the action of potassium
cyanide on a solution of bismuth nitrate. The meta-salts of bismuthic acid are
known, for example KBiO<sub>3</sub>. They generally occur, however, in combinations with metabismuthic
acid itself. Thus André (1891) took a solution of the double salt of BiBr<sub>3</sub> and
KBr, treated it with bromine after adding ammonia, and obtained a red-brown precipitate,
which after being washed (for several weeks) had the composition KBiO<sub>3</sub>,HBiO<sub>3</sub>
When washed with dilute nitric acid this salt gave bismuthic acid.</p></div>

bismuth to a bright red heat in a stream of nitrogen. A greenish vapour was deposited
in the cooler portions of the apparatus in the form of a grey powder, which under the

necessary for this transformation, other gases such as hydrogen and carbonic oxide do not
favour the transition. The resultant amorphous bismuth fuses at 410° (the crystalline

salt formed. The ultimate product, on which an excess of water has apparently no
action whatever, is a substance having the composition BiO(NO<sub>3</sub>).BiO(OH). In the
latter salt we see the limit of change, and this limit appears to show that the type
of the saline compounds of bismuthic oxide is of the form Bi<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>, and not BiX<sub>3</sub>;
but it is very probable, on the basis of the examples which we considered in the case of
lead, that this type should be still further polymerised in order to give a correct idea of the
type of the bismuthous compounds. If we refer all the bismuthous compounds to this
type, Bi<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>, we shall obtain the following expression for the composition of the nitrates:
normal salt, Bi<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>, first basic salt, Bi<sub>2</sub>O(OH)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, magistery of bismuth,
Bi<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and the limiting form Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)(NO<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p>The general character of bismuthous oxide in its compounds is well exemplified
in the nitrate; bismuthous chloride, BiCl<sub>3</sub>, which is obtained by heating bismuth
in chlorine, or by dissolving it in aqua regia, and then distilling without access of
air, is also decomposed by water in exactly the same manner, and forms basic
salts&mdash;for instance, first, BiOCl, like the above salt of nitric acid. Bismuth
chloride boils at 447° and probably its formula is BiCl<sub>3</sub>. Polymerisation may take
place in some compounds and not in others. A volatile compound of the composition
Bi(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub> is also known as a liquid which is insoluble in water and decomposes with
explosion when heated at 130°. Double salts containing chloride of bismuth are:
2(KCl)BiCl<sub>3</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O (from a solution of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and KCl in hydrochloric acid) and
KClBiCl<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O. Bigham (1892) also obtained KBr(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in tabular crystals by treating
the above-named double salt with strong sulphuric acid. The composition of this salt
recalls that of alum.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_259" id="Footnote_47_259"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_259"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> As the metals contained in alloys like the above (bismuth, lead, tin, cadmium) are
difficultly volatile and their alloys are fusible, they may be employed in the place of mercury
in many physical experiments conducted at or above 70°, and they offer the advantage
that they do not give any vapour having an appreciable tension (mercury at 100°, 0·75 mm.)
Bismuth expands in passing into a molten state, but it has a temperature of maximum
density. According to Luedeking the mean coefficient of expansion of liquid bismuth is
0·0000442 (between 270° and 303°), and of solid bismuth 0·0000411.</p></div>

tube at 400°, they lose a portion of their chlorine and form a green crystalline mass
of sp. gr. 2·88, which is deliquescent in air and has the composition VOCl<sub>2</sub>. Only
its vapour density is unknown, and it would be extremely important to determine
whether its molecular composition is that given above, or whether it corresponds with
the formula V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>. Another less volatile oxychloride, VOCl, is formed with it as
a brown insoluble substance, which is, however, soluble in nitric acid like the preceding.
Roscoe obtained a still less chlorinated substance, namely, (VO)<sub>2</sub>Cl; but it may only
consist of a mixture of VO and VOCl. At all events, we here find a graduated series such
as is met with in the compounds of very few other elements.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_262" id="Footnote_50_262"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_262"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Strong acids and alkalis dissolve vanadic anhydride in considerable quantities,
forming yellow solutions. When it is ignited, especially in a current of hydrogen, it
evolves oxygen and forms the lower oxides; V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (acid solutions of a green colour, like
the salts of chromic oxide), V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the lowest oxide, VO. The latter is the metallic
powder which is obtained when the vanadium oxychloride is heated in an excess of
hydrogen, and was formerly mistaken for metallic vanadium. When a solution of
vanadic acid is treated with metallic zinc it forms a blue solution, which seems to contain
this oxide. It acts as a reducing agent (and forms a close analogue to chromous oxide,
CrO). Metallic <i>vanadium</i> can only be obtained from vanadium chloride which is quite
free from oxygen. Moissan (1893) obtained it by reducing the oxide with carbon in the
electric furnace, and considered it to be most infusible of the metals in the series Pt,
Cr, Mo, U, W, and V (he also obtained a compound of vanadium and carbon). The
specific gravity of this metal is 5·5. It is of a grey-white colour, is not decomposed by
water, and is not oxidised in air, but burns when strongly heated, and can be fused in a
current of hydrogen (forming perhaps a compound with hydrogen). It is insoluble in
hydrochloric acid, but easily dissolves in nitric acid, and when fused with caustic soda it
forms sodium vanadate.</p>

<p>As regards the salts of vanadic acid, three different classes are known; the first
correspond with metavanadic acid, VMO<sub>3</sub> = M<sub>2</sub>OV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, the second correspond with the
dichromates&mdash;that is, have the composition V<sub>4</sub>M<sub>2</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, which is equal to M<sub>2</sub>O + 2V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>&mdash;and
the third correspond with orthovanadic acid, VM<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or 3M<sub>2</sub>O + V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The latter
are formed when vanadic anhydride is fused with an excess of an alkaline carbonate.</p>

<p>Vanadic acid gives the so-called &lsquo;complex&rsquo; acids (which are considered more fully in
Chapter <a href="#Page_276">XXI.</a> in speaking of Mo and W)&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> acids formed of two acids assimilated into
one. Thus Friedheim (1890) obtained phosphor-vanadic acid, and Schmitz-Dumont
(1890) a similar arseno-vanadic acid. The former is obtained by heating V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with
sirupy phosphoric acid. The resultant golden-yellow tabular crystals have the
composition H<sub>2</sub>OV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>9H<sub>2</sub>O, and there are corresponding salts&mdash;for example,
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with 3 and 7H<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c. These salts cannot be separated by crystallisation,
so that there are &lsquo;complexes&rsquo; of these acids in a whole series of salts (and also in
nature). It may be supposed (Friedheim) that V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> here, as it were, plays the part of a
base, or that those acids may be looked upon as double salts. Among the true double
salts of vanadium (Nb and Ta) very many are known among the fluorides, such as
VF<sub>3</sub>2NH<sub>4</sub>F, VOF<sub>2</sub>2NH<sub>4</sub>F, VO<sub>2</sub>F,3NH<sub>4</sub>F, &amp;c. (Pettersson, Piccini, and Georgi, 1890&ndash;92).</p>

<p>Vanadium was discovered at the beginning of this century by Del-Rio, and afterwards
investigated by Sefström, but it was only in 1868 that Roscoe established the above
formulæ of the vanadic compounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_263" id="Footnote_51_263"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_263"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> The researches made by Roscoe were preceded by those of Marignac in 1865, on
the <i>compounds</i> of <i>niobium</i> and <i>tantalum</i>, to which were also ascribed different formulæ
from those now recognised. Tantalum was discovered simultaneously with vanadium
by Hatchett and Ekeberg, and was afterwards studied by Rose, who in 1844 discovered
niobium in it. Notwithstanding the numerous researches of Hermann (in Moscow),
Kobell, Rose, and Marignac, still there is not yet any certainty as to the purity of, and
the properties ascribed to, the compounds of these elements. They are difficult to
separate from each other, and especially from the cerite metals and titanium, &amp;c., which
accompany them. Before the investigations of Rose the highest oxide of tantalum was
supposed to belong to the type TaX<sub>6</sub>&mdash;that is, its composition was taken as TaO<sub>3</sub>, and to
the lower oxide was ascribed a formula TaO<sub>2</sub>. Rose gave the formula TaO<sub>2</sub> to the
higher oxide, and discovered a new element called niobium in the substance previously
supposed to be the lower oxide. He even admitted the existence of a third element occurring
together with tantalum and niobium, which he named pelopium, but he afterwards
found that pelopic acid was only another oxide of niobium, and he considered it probable
that the higher oxide of this element is NbO<sub>2</sub>, and the lower Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Hermann found that
niobic acid which was considered pure contained a considerable quantity of tantalic acid,
and besides this he admitted the existence of another special metallic acid, which he called
ilmenic acid, after the locality (the Ilmen mountains of the Urals) of the mineral from
which he obtained it. V. Kobell recognised still another acid, which he called dianic acid,
and these diverse statements were only brought into agreement in the sixties by Marignac.
He first of all indicated an accurate method for the separation of tantalic and niobic
compounds, which are always obtained in admixture.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_264" id="Footnote_52_264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_264"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> If niobic acid be mixed with a small quantity of charcoal and ignited in a stream
of chlorine, a difficultly-fusible and difficultly-volatile oxychloride, NbOCl<sub>3</sub> separates.
The vapour density of this compound with respect to air is 7·5, and this vapour density
perfectly confirms the accuracy of the formulæ given by Marignac, and indicates the
quantitative analogy between the compounds of niobium and tantalum, and those of
phosphorus and arsenic, and consequently also of vanadium. In their qualitative relations
(as is evident also from the correspondence of the atomic weights), the compounds
of tantalum and niobium exhibit a great analogy with the compounds of molybdenum and
tungsten. Thus zinc, when acting on acid solutions of tantalic and niobic compounds,
gives a blue coloration, exactly as it does with those of tungsten and molybdenum (also
titanium). These acids form the same large number of salts as those of tungsten and
molybdenum. The anhydrides of the acids are also insoluble in water, but as colloids are
sometimes held in solution, just like those of titanic and molybdic acids. Furthermore,
niobium is in every respect the nearest analogue of molybdenum, and tantalum of tungsten.
<i>Niobium</i> is obtained by reducing the double fluoride of niobium and sodium, with
sodium. It is difficult to obtain in a pure state. It is a metal on which hydrochloric
acid acts with some energy, as also does hydrofluoric acid mixed with nitric acid, and also
a boiling solution of caustic potash. <i>Tantalum</i>, which is obtained in exactly the same
way, is a much heavier metal. It is infusible, and is only acted on by a mixture of
hydrofluoric and nitric acids. Rose in 1868 showed that in the reduction of the double
fluoride, NbF<sub>5</sub>,2KF, by sodium, a greyish powder is obtained after treating with water.
The specific gravity of this powder is 6·8, and he considers it to be niobium hydride,
NbH. Neither did he obtain metallic niobium when he reduced with magnesium and
aluminium, but an alloy, Al<sub>3</sub>Nb, having a sp. gr. of 4·5.</p>

<p>Niobium, so far as is known, unites in three proportions with oxygen. NbO, which is
formed when NbOF<sub>3</sub>,2KF is reduced by sodium; NbO<sub>2</sub>, which is formed by igniting
niobic acid in a stream of hydrogen, and niobic anhydride, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, a white infusible
substance, which is insoluble in acids, and has a specific gravity of 4·5. Tantalic anhydride
closely resembles niobic anhydride, and has a specific gravity of 7·2. <i>The tantalates
and niobates</i> present the type of ortho-salts&mdash;for example, Na<sub>2</sub>HNbO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, and also of
pyro-salts, such as K<sub>3</sub>HNb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, and of meta-salts&mdash;for example, KNbO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O.
And, besides these, they give salts of a more complex type, containing a larger amount
of the elements of the anhydride; thus, for instance, when niobic anhydride is fused
with caustic potash it forms a salt which is soluble in water, and crystallises in monoclinic
prisms, having the composition K<sub>8</sub>Nb<sub>6</sub>O<sub>19</sub>,16H<sub>2</sub>O. There is a perfectly similar
isomorphous salt of tantalic acid. Tantalite is a salt of the type of metatantalic acid,
Fe(TaO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. The composition of Yttrotantalite appears to correspond with orthotantalic
acid.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">SULPHUR, SELENIUM, AND TELLURIUM</span></h2>

<p>The acid character of the higher oxides RO<sub>3</sub> of the elements of
group VI. is still more clearly defined than that of the higher oxides of
the preceding groups, whilst feeble basic properties only appear in
the oxides RO<sub>3</sub> of the elements of the even series, and then only for
those elements having a high atomic weight&mdash;that is, under those two
conditions in which, as a rule, the basic characters increase. Even the
lower types RO<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., formed by the elements of group VI.,
are acid anhydrides in the uneven series, and only those of the elements
of the even series have the properties of peroxides or even of bases.</p>

<p><i>Sulphur</i> is the typical representative of group VI., both on account of
the fact that the acid properties of the group are clearly defined in it, and
also because it is more widely distributed in nature than any of the other
elements belonging to this group. As an element of the uneven series
of group VI., sulphur gives H<sub>2</sub>S, sulphuretted hydrogen, SO<sub>3</sub>, sulphuric
anhydride, and SO<sub>2</sub>, sulphurous anhydride. And in all of them we find
acid properties&mdash;SO<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> are anhydrides of acids, and H<sub>2</sub>S is an
acid, although a feeble one. As an element sulphur has all the properties
of a true non-metal; it has not a metallic lustre, does not
conduct electricity, is a bad conductor of heat, is transparent, and
combines directly with metals&mdash;in short it has all the properties of the
non-metals, like oxygen and chlorine. Furthermore, sulphur exhibits
a great qualitative and quantitative <i>resemblance to oxygen</i>, especially
in the fact that, like oxygen, it combines <i>with two atoms of hydrogen</i>,
and forms compounds resembling oxides with metals and non-metals.
From this point of view sulphur is bivalent, if the halogens are univalent.<a name="FNanchor_1_265" id="FNanchor_1_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_265" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The chemical character of sulphur is expressed by the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
that it forms a very slightly stable and feebly energetic acid with
hydrogen. The salts corresponding with this acid are the sulphides,
just as the oxides correspond to water and the chlorides to hydrochloric
acid. However, as we shall afterwards see more fully, the sulphides
are more analogous to the former than to the latter. But although
combining with metals, like oxygen, sulphur also forms chemically
stable compounds with oxygen, and this fact impresses a peculiar
character on all the relations of this element.<a name="FNanchor_2_266" id="FNanchor_2_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_266" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Sulphur belongs to the number of those elements which <i>are very
widely distributed in nature</i>, and occurs both free and combined in
various forms. The atmosphere, however, is almost entirely free from
compounds of sulphur, although a certain amount of them should be
present, if only from the fact that sulphurous anhydride is emitted
from the earth in volcanic eruptions, and in the air of cities, where
much coal is burnt, since this always contains FeS<sub>2</sub>. Sea and river
water generally contain more or less sulphur in the form of sulphates.
The beds of gypsum, sodium sulphate, magnesium sulphate,
and the like are formations of undoubtedly aqueous origin. The sulphates
contained in the soil are the source of the sulphur found in
plants, and are indispensable to their growth. Among vegetable
substances, the proteïds always contain from one to two per cent. of
sulphur. From plants the albuminous substances, together with their
sulphur, pass into the animal organism, and therefore the decomposition
of animal matter is accompanied by the odour of sulphuretted hydrogen,
as the product into which the sulphur passes in the decomposition of
the albuminous substances. Thus a rotten egg emits sulphuretted hydrogen.
Sulphur occurs largely in nature, as the various insoluble sulphides
of the metals. Iron, copper, zinc, lead, antimony, arsenic, &amp;c.,
occur in nature combined with sulphur. These <i>sulphides</i> frequently
have a metallic lustre, and in the majority of cases occur crystallised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and also very often several sulphides occur combined or mixed
together in these crystalline compounds. If they are yellow and have
a metallic lustre they are called pyrites. Such are, for example,
copper pyrites, CuFeS<sub>2</sub>, and iron pyrites, FeS<sub>2</sub>, which is the commonest
of all. They are all also known as glances or blendes if they are
greyish and have a metallic lustre&mdash;for example, zinc blende, lead
glance, PbS, antimony glance, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. And, lastly, sulphur occurs
<i>native</i>. It occurs in this form in the most recent geological formations
in admixture with limestone and gypsum, and most frequently in the
vicinity of active or extinct volcanoes. As the gases of volcanoes contain
sulphur compounds&mdash;namely, sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphurous
anhydride, which by reacting on one another may produce sulphur, which
also frequently appears in the craters of volcanoes as a sublimate&mdash;it
might be imagined that the sulphur was of volcanic origin. But on a
nearer acquaintance with its mode of occurrence, and more especially
considering its relation to gypsum, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, and limestone, the present
general opinion leads to the conclusion that the &lsquo;native&rsquo; sulphur has
been formed by the reduction of the gypsum by organic matter and
that its occurrence is only indirectly connected with volcanic agencies.
Near Tetush, on the Volga, there are beds containing gypsum, sulphur,
and asphalt (mineral tar). In Europe the most important deposits of
sulphur are in the south of Sicily from Catania to Girgenti.<a name="FNanchor_3_267" id="FNanchor_3_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_267" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> There
are very rich deposits of sulphur in Daghestan near Cherkai and
Cherkat in Khyut, near Mount Kanabour-bam, near Petrovsk, and
in the Kira Koumski steppes in the Trans-Caspian provinces, which
are able to supply the whole of Russia with this mineral. Abundant
deposits of sulphur have also been found in Kamtchatka in the neighbourhood
of the volcanoes. The method of separation of the sulphur
from its earthy impurities is based on the fact that sulphur melts when
it is heated. The fusion is carried on at the expense of a portion of
the sulphur, which is burnt, so that the remainder may melt and run
from the mass of the earth. This is carried on in special furnaces
called calcaroni, built up of unhewn stone in the neighbourhood of the
mines.<a name="FNanchor_4_268" id="FNanchor_4_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_268" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Sulphur is purified by distillation in special retorts (see fig. <a href="#fig_86">86</a>) by
passing the vapour into a chamber G built of stone. The first portions
of the vapour entering into the condensing chamber are condensed
straightway from the vapour into a solid state, and form a fine powder
known as <i>flowers of sulphur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_5_269" id="FNanchor_5_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_269" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But when the temperature of the
receiver attains the melting point of sulphur, it passes into a liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
state and is cast into moulds (like sealing wax), and is then known
under the name of <i>roll sulphur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_270" id="FNanchor_6_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_270" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>In an uncombined state sulphur exists in <i>several modifications</i>, and
forms a good example of the facility with which an alteration of properties
can take place without a change of composition&mdash;that is, as regards
the material of a substance. Common sulphur has the well-known
yellow colour. This colour fades as the temperature falls, and at -50°
sulphur is almost colourless. It is very brittle, so that it may be easily
converted into a powder, and it presents a crystalline structure, which,
by the way, shows itself in the unequal expansion of lumps of sulphur
by heat. Hence when a piece of sulphur is heated by the warmth of
the hand, it emits sounds and sometimes cracks, which probably also
depends on the bad heat-conducting power of this substance. It is easily
obtained in a crystalline form by artificial means, because although
insoluble in water it dissolves in carbon bisulphide, and in certain oils.<a name="FNanchor_7_271" id="FNanchor_7_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_271" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Solutions of sulphur in carbon bisulphide when evaporated at the
ordinary temperature yield well-formed transparent crystals of sulphur
in the form of rhombic octahedra, in which form it occurs native. The
specific gravity of these crystals is 2·045. Fused sulphur, cast into
moulds and cooled, has, after being kept a long time, a specific gravity
2·066; almost the same as that of the crystalline sulphur of the above
form, which shows that common sulphur is the same as that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
crystallises in octahedra. The specific heat of octahedral sulphur is
0·17; it melts at 114°, and forms a bright yellow mobile liquid. On
further heating, the fused sulphur undergoes an alteration, which we
shall presently describe, first observing that the above octahedral state
of sulphur is its most stable form. Sulphur may be kept at the ordinary
temperature in this form for an indefinite length of time, and
many other modifications of sulphur pass into this form after being left
for a certain time at ordinary temperature.</p>

<p>If sulphur be melted and then slightly cooled, so that it forms a
crust on the surface and over the sides of the crucible, while the
internal mass remains liquid, then the sulphur takes another crystalline
form as it solidifies. This may be seen by breaking the crust, and
pouring out the remaining molten sulphur.<a name="FNanchor_8_272" id="FNanchor_8_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_272" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It is then found that the
sides of the crucible are covered with <i>prismatic crystals</i> of the monoclinic
system; they have a totally different appearance from the above-described
crystals of rhombic sulphur. The prismatic crystals are
brown, transparent, and less dense than the crystals of rhombic
sulphur, their specific gravity being only 1·93, and their melting point
higher&mdash;about 120°. These crystals of sulphur cannot be kept at
the ordinary temperature, which is indeed evident from the fact that
in time they turn yellow; the specific gravity also changes, and they
pass completely into the ordinary modification. This is accompanied
by a considerable development of heat, so that the temperature of the
mass may rise 12°. Thus sulphur is <i>dimorphous</i>&mdash;that is, it exists in
two crystalline forms, and in both forms it has independent physical
properties. However, no chemical reactions are known which distinguish
the two modifications of sulphur, just as there are none distinguishing
aragonite from calcspar.<a name="FNanchor_9_273" id="FNanchor_9_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_273" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>If molten sulphur be heated to 158° it loses its mobility and
becomes thick and very dark-coloured, so that the crucible in which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
is heated may be inverted without the sulphur running out. When
heated above this temperature the sulphur again becomes liquid, and
at 250° it is very mobile, although it does not acquire its original
colour, and at 440° it boils. These modifications in the properties of
sulphur depend not only on the variations of temperature, but also on
a change of structure. If sulphur, heated to about 350°, be poured in
a thin stream into cold water, it does not solidify into a solid mass, but
retains its brown colour and <i>remains soft</i>, may be stretched out into
threads, and is elastic, like guttapercha. But in this soft and ductile
state, also, it does not remain for a long time. After the lapse of a
certain period this soft transparent sulphur hardens, becomes opaque,
passes into the ordinary yellow modification of sulphur, and in so doing
develops heat, just as in the conversion of the prismatic into the octahedral
variety. The soft sulphur is characterised by the fact that a
certain portion of it is insoluble in carbon bisulphide. When soft sulphur
is immersed in this liquid, only a portion of common sulphur
passes into solution, whilst a certain portion is quite insoluble and
remains so for a long time. The maximum proportion of insoluble
sulphur is obtained by heating slightly above 170°. It melts at 114°.
An exactly similar <i>insoluble amorphous sulphur</i> is obtained in certain
reactions in the wet way, when sulphur separates out from solutions.
Thus sodium thiosulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, when treated with acids, gives a
precipitate of sulphur, which is insoluble in carbon bisulphide. The
action of water on sulphur chloride also gives a similar modification of
sulphur. Certain sulphides, when treated with nitric acid, also yield
sulphur in this form.<a name="FNanchor_10_274" id="FNanchor_10_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_274" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>At temperatures of 440° to 700° the vapour density of sulphur is
6·6 referred to air&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> about 96 referred to hydrogen. Hence, at
these temperatures <i>the molecule of sulphur contains six atoms</i>, it has
the composition S<sub>6</sub>. The agreement between the observations of Dumas,
Mitscherlich, Bineau, and Deville confirms the accuracy of this result.
But in this respect the properties of sulphur were found to be variable.
When heated to higher temperatures, that is to say, <i>above</i> 800°, the
vapour density of sulphur is found to be one-third of this quantity, <i>i.e.</i>
about 32 referred to hydrogen. At this temperature <i>the molecule of
sulphur</i>, like that of hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and chlorine, <i>contains
two atoms</i>; hence the molecular formula is then S<sub>2</sub>. This variation in
the vapour density of sulphur evidently corresponds with a polymeric
modification, and may be likened to the transformation of ozone, O<sub>3</sub>,
into oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>, or better still, of benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, into acetylene,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_11_275" id="FNanchor_11_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_275" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p><i>In its faculty for combination</i>, sulphur most closely resembles oxygen
and chlorine; like them, it combines with nearly all elements, with
the development of heat and light, forming sulphur compounds, but
as a rule this only takes place at a high temperature. At the ordinary
temperature it does not enter into reactions, owing, amongst other
things, to the fact that it is a solid. In a molten state it acts on most
metals and on the halogens. It burns in air at about 300°, and with
carbon at a red heat, but it does not combine with nitrogen.</p>

<p>Fine wires, or the powders of the greater number of metals, burn in
the vapour of sulphur. The direct combination of hydrogen with sulphur
is restricted by a limit&mdash;that is, at a given temperature and under
other given conditions it does not proceed unrestrictedly; there is no
explosion or recalescence. Sulphuretted hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>S, decomposes at
its temperature of combination&mdash;that is, it is easily dissociated.<a name="FNanchor_12_276" id="FNanchor_12_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_276" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The
same phenomenon is repeated here as with water, except that the temperatures
at which the attraction of hydrogen for sulphur begins and
ceases are much lower than in the case of oxygen and hydrogen. The
temperature at which combination takes place is here, as in many other
instances, nearly the same as that at which dissociation begins. Hence
<i>sulphuretted hydrogen</i> is formed in a small quantity by the direct
ignition of a mixture of the vapour of sulphur and hydrogen. However,
the temperature must not be high, because otherwise the whole
of the sulphuretted hydrogen is decomposed; but at lower temperatures
a small amount of sulphuretted hydrogen is formed by direct combination.<a name="FNanchor_13_277" id="FNanchor_13_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_277" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
Sulphuretted hydrogen however, like all other hydrogen compounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
may be easily obtained by the double decomposition of its corresponding
metallic compounds, the replacement of the metal by hydrogen
being effected by the action of acids on the sulphides. The metallic sulphides
are, as a rule, easily formed. A sulphide, when mixed with a non-volatile
acid, may give, by double decomposition, a salt of the acid taken
and sulphuretted hydrogen, M<sub>2</sub>S + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>S + M<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. However, it
is not all sulphides nor solutions of all acids that will evolve sulphuretted
hydrogen, which fact is exceedingly characteristic, because, for example,
all carbonates evolve carbonic anhydride when treated with any acid.
Sulphuric acid will only evolve sulphuretted hydrogen from those sulphides
which contain a metal capable of decomposing the acid with the
evolution of hydrogen. Thus zinc, iron, calcium, magnesium, manganese,
potassium, sodium, &amp;c., form sulphides which evolve sulphuretted
hydrogen when treated with sulphuric acid, and the metals themselves
evolve hydrogen with acids.<a name="FNanchor_14_278" id="FNanchor_14_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_278" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The sulphides of those metals which do
not liberate hydrogen from acids do not generally act on acids&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
do not form sulphuretted hydrogen with them; such are, for example,
the sulphides of lead, silver, copper, mercury, tin, &amp;c. Therefore, the
<i>modus operandi</i> of the formation of sulphuretted hydrogen by the action
of acids on metallic sulphides may be looked on as a phenomenon of the
combination of hydrogen, at the moment of its evolution, with the sulphur,
which is combined with the metal. Such a representation is all
the more simple as all the circumstances under which sulphuretted
hydrogen is formed are exactly similar to the conditions of the formation
of hydrogen itself. Thus the usual mode of preparing sulphuretted
hydrogen is by the action of <i>sulphuric acid on ferrous sulphide</i>, in
which the same apparatus and method are employed as in the preparation
of hydrogen, only replacing the metallic iron or zinc by ferrous
sulphide or zinc sulphide. The reaction between sulphide of iron and
sulphuric acid takes place at the ordinary temperature, and is accompanied
by just as small a development of heat as in the liberation of
hydrogen itself, FeS + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = FeSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S.<a name="FNanchor_15_279" id="FNanchor_15_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_279" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><i>In nature</i> sulphuretted hydrogen is formed in many ways. The
most usual mode of its formation is by the decomposition of albuminous
substances containing sulphur, as mentioned above. Another
method is by the reducing action of organic matter on sulphates,
and by the action of water and carbonic acid on the sulphides formed
by this reduction. Volcanic eruptions are a third source of sulphuretted
hydrogen in nature. Although sulphuretted hydrogen is formed in
small quantities everywhere, it nevertheless soon disappears from the
atmosphere, owing to its being easily decomposed by oxidising agencies.
Many mineral waters contain sulphuretted hydrogen, and smell of it;
they are called &lsquo;sulphur waters.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sulphuretted hydrogen, at the ordinary temperature, is a colourless
gas, having a very unpleasant odour. It has, as its composition H<sub>2</sub>S
shows, a specific gravity seventeen times greater than hydrogen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
therefore it is somewhat heavier than air. Sulphuretted hydrogen <i>liquefies</i>
at about -74°, and at the ordinary temperature when subjected to a
pressure of 10 to 15 atmospheres; at -85° it is converted into a solid
crystalline mass.<a name="FNanchor_15_BIS_280" id="FNanchor_15_BIS_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_BIS_280" class="fnanchor">[15 bis]</a> The easy liquefaction of sulphuretted hydrogen
is evidently allied to its solubility. One volume of water at 0° dissolves
4·37 volumes of sulphuretted hydrogen, at 10° 3·58 volumes,
and at 20° 2·9 volumes.<a name="FNanchor_16_281" id="FNanchor_16_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_281" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The solutions impart a very feeble red
coloration to litmus paper. This gas is poisonous. One part in fifteen
hundred parts of air will kill birds. Mammalia die in an atmosphere
containing <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub> of this gas.</p>

<p>Sulphuretted hydrogen is very easily <i>decomposed</i> into its component
parts by the action of heat or a series of electric sparks. Hence it is
not surprising that sulphuretted hydrogen undergoes change under the
action of many substances having a considerable affinity for hydrogen
and oxygen. Very many metals<a name="FNanchor_17_282" id="FNanchor_17_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_282" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> evolve hydrogen with sulphuretted
hydrogen, so that in this respect it presents the property of an acid; for
instance, 2H<sub>2</sub>S + Sn = 2H<sub>2</sub> + SnS<sub>2</sub>. This may be taken advantage of for
determining the composition of sulphuretted hydrogen, because a given
volume then leaves the same volume of hydrogen. On the other hand,
oxygen,<a name="FNanchor_18_283" id="FNanchor_18_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_283" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> chlorine,<a name="FNanchor_19_284" id="FNanchor_19_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_284" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and even iodine decompose sulphuretted hydrogen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
removing the hydrogen from it and leaving free sulphur, so that in
this reaction the sulphur is replaced by the above-named elements; for
example, H<sub>2</sub>S + Br<sub>2</sub> = 2HBr + S. In no other hydrogen compound is
it so easy to show the <i>substitution</i>, both of hydrogen and of the element
combined with it, as in hydrogen sulphide. This clearly proves
the feeble union between the elements forming this gas. Compounds
containing a considerable amount of oxygen, with which they easily
part, can accomplish the separation of the sulphur very easily. Such
are, for instance, nitrous acid, chromic acid, and even ferric oxide and
the higher oxides like it. Thus, if sulphuretted hydrogen be passed
into a solution of chromic acid or an acid solution of ferric oxide,
water is formed, <i>and the sulphur is separated in a free state</i>. Thus,
sulphuretted hydrogen acts as a <i>reducing agent</i>, in virtue of the hydrogen
it contains. Salts of iodic, chlorous, chloric, and other acids are
reduced by sulphuretted hydrogen, their oxygen acting mainly on its
hydrogen; but in the presence of an excess of a powerful oxidising
agent a portion of the sulphur may also be oxidised to sulphurous
anhydride. The reducing action of sulphuretted hydrogen is frequently
applied in chemical manipulations for the preparation of lower oxides,
and for the conversion of certain oxygen compounds into hydrogen
compounds: thus, the higher oxides of nitrogen are converted into
ammonia by it, and in the presence of alkalis the nitro-compounds are
converted into ammonia derivatives. The reaction of sulphuretted
hydrogen on sulphurous anhydride belongs to this class of phenomena,
the chief products of which are sulphur and water, 2H<sub>2</sub>S + SO<sub>2</sub>
= 2H<sub>2</sub>O + S<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The acid character of sulphuretted hydrogen is clearly seen in its
action on alkalis and salts.<a name="FNanchor_19_BIS_285" id="FNanchor_19_BIS_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_BIS_285" class="fnanchor">[19 bis]</a> Thus lead oxide and its salts in
the presence of sulphuretted hydrogen form water or an acid, and sulphide
of lead: PbX<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S = PbS + 2HX. This reaction takes place
even in the presence of powerful acids, because lead sulphide is one of
those sulphides which are unacted on by acids, and in solutions the
reaction is a complete one. This reaction is taken advantage of for
the preparation of many acids, by first converting into a lead salt, and
then submitting this salt to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen. For
example, lead formate with sulphuretted hydrogen gives formic acid.
Sulphuretted hydrogen in acting on a number of metallic acid substances
in solution or in an anhydrous state also forms corresponding sulphates:
(1) if it does not reduce the acid; (2) if the sulphur compound corresponding
with the anhydride of the acid be insoluble in water, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
reaction proceeds in solutions; (3) if the sulphuretted hydrogen and the
acid taken do not come in contact with an alkali, on which they would
be able to act first; and (4) if the sulphur compound be not decomposed
by water. Thus solutions of arsenious acid give a precipitate of
arsenious sulphide, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, with sulphuretted hydrogen. This reaction
proceeds not only in the presence of water, but also of acids, because
the latter do not decompose the resultant sulphur compounds. The
type of the decomposition is the same as with bases&mdash;that is, the
sulphur and oxygen change places: RO<sub><i>n</i></sub>+<i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>S = RS<sub><i>n</i></sub> + <i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O. Some
sulphides corresponding with acid anhydrides are decomposed by
water, and therefore are not formed in the presence of water. Such,
for example, are the sulphides of phosphorus.<a name="FNanchor_20_286" id="FNanchor_20_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_286" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The metallic sulphides corresponding with the metallic oxides
have either a feeble alkaline or a feeble acid character, according to
the character of the corresponding oxide, and therefore by combining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
together they are able to form saline substances&mdash;that is, salts in
which the oxygen is replaced by sulphur. Thus sulphuretted hydrogen
having the properties of a feeble acid<a name="FNanchor_21_287" id="FNanchor_21_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_287" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> has, at the same time, the
properties of water, and forms the type of the sulphur derivatives,
which may also be formed by means of sulphuretted hydrogen, just as
the oxides may be formed by the aid of water. But as sulphuretted
hydrogen has acid properties, it combines more easily with the basic
metallic sulphides. Hence, for instance, there exists a compound
of sulphuretted hydrogen with potassium sulphide, potassium hydrosulphide,
2KHS = K<sub>2</sub>S + H<sub>2</sub>S, just as there are potassium hydroxides;
but there are scarcely any compounds of sulphuretted hydrogen with
the sulphides corresponding with acids. Thus the sulphides of the
metals may be regarded either as salts of sulphuretted hydrogen or as
oxides of the metals in which the oxygen is replaced by sulphur. In
general terms the sulphides exhibit the same degrees of difference with
respect to their solubility in water as do the oxides. Thus the oxides of
the alkali metals, and of some of the metals of the alkaline earths, are
soluble in water, whilst those of nearly all the other metals are insoluble.
The same may be said as to the sulphides; the sulphides of the metals
of the alkalis and certain of the alkaline earths are soluble in water,
whilst those of the other metals are insoluble. Those metals, like aluminium,
whose oxides&mdash;for example, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;have intermediate properties
and do not form compounds with feeble acids, at least in a
wet way, also do not form sulphides by this method, although these
may be obtained indirectly. And in general the sulphides of the metals
are easily formed in a wet way, and with particular ease if they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
insoluble in water. In this case their salts enter into double decomposition
with sulphuretted hydrogen, or with soluble sulphides, and
give an insoluble sulphide&mdash;for instance, a salt of lead gives lead
sulphide with sulphuretted hydrogen. By the action of sulphuretted
hydrogen on a salt of a metal, a free acid must be formed besides the
metallic sulphide. Thus if a metal M be in a state of combination
MX<sub>2</sub>, then by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen there will be formed,
besides MS,<a name="FNanchor_22_288" id="FNanchor_22_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_288" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> an acid 2HX. It is evident that sulphuretted hydrogen
will not precipitate an insoluble sulphide from the salts of those metals
whose sulphides react with free acid, such as zinc, iron, manganese, &amp;c.
The reaction FeCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S = FeS + 2HCl, and the like, do not take place
because the acid acts on the ferrous sulphide. Antimonious sulphide
is not acted on by dilute hydrochloric acid, but it is decomposed by
strong acid, and therefore in presence of an excess of hydrochloric acid
antimonious chloride does not entirely react with hydrogen sulphide,
whilst the reaction 2SbCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>S = Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> + 6HCl is a complete one
in a dilute solution and with a small quantity of acid. Those metallic
sulphides which are decomposed by acids may be obtained in a wet way
by the double decomposition of the salts of the metals, not with hydrogen
sulphide, but with soluble metallic sulphides, such as sulphide of
ammonium or of potassium, because then no free acid is formed, but a
salt of the metal (potassium or ammonium) which was taken as a
soluble sulphide. So, for example, FeCl<sub>2</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>S = FeS + 2KCl.<a name="FNanchor_23_289" id="FNanchor_23_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_289" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Metallic sulphides may be obtained by many other means besides
the action of sulphuretted hydrogen on salts and oxides, or by the
simple combination of metals with sulphur when heated or fused. Thus
they may also be formed by the reduction of sulphates by heating them
with charcoal or other means. Charcoal takes up the oxygen from
many sulphates, leaving corresponding sulphides. Thus sodium sulphate,
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, when heated with charcoal, forms sodium sulphide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Na<sub>2</sub>S. Besides which metallic sulphides are also obtained by heating
metals or their oxides in the vapours of many sulphur compounds&mdash;for
example, in the vapour of carbon bisulphide, CS<sub>2</sub>, when the carbon takes
up the oxygen and the sulphur combines with the metal. The sulphides
formed in this manner are often crystalline, and often appear with
those properties and in that crystalline form in which they occur in
nature. Besides which we must mention that many of the sulphides
of the metals are oxidised in air at the ordinary, and especially at a
higher, temperature, forming either SO<sub>2</sub> and the oxide of the metal or
sulphates. This oxidation proceeds with particular ease, even at the
ordinary temperature, when a metallic sulphide is precipitated from
its solutions, as a fine powder containing water. The sulphides of iron
and manganese, &amp;c., are very easily oxidised in this manner. But if
these hydrates be ignited, they lose their water (the ignition must be
carried on in a stream of hydrogen to prevent their oxidation during
the process), become denser, and are no longer oxidised at the ordinary
temperature. Those sulphides whose corresponding sulphates are decomposed
by heat part with their sulphur in the form of sulphurous
anhydride when they are ignited in air, and the metal, as a rule,
remains behind as oxide. This is taken advantage of in the treatment
of sulphurous ores. The process is called <i>roasting</i>.</p>

<p>Hydrogen not only forms sulphuretted hydrogen with sulphur, but
it also combines with it in several other proportions, just as it combines
with oxygen, forming not only water but also hydrogen peroxide.
Moreover these <i>polysulphides of hydrogen</i> are also unstable, like
hydrogen peroxide, and are also obtained from the corresponding
polysulphides of the metals of the alkaline earths, just as hydrogen
peroxide is obtained from barium peroxide. Thus calcium forms not
only calcium sulphide, CaS, but also as bi-, tri-, and pentasulphide,
CaS<sub>5</sub>, and all these compounds are soluble in water. Sodium also combines
with sulphur in the same proportions, forming sulphides from
Na<sub>2</sub>S to Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>. If an acid be added to a solution of a polysulphide,
it gives sulphur, sulphuretted hydrogen, and a salt of the metal. For
instance, MS<sub>5</sub>, + 2HCl = MCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S + 4S. If we reverse the operation,
and pour a solution of a polysulphide into an acid, sulphur is
not precipitated, but an oily liquid is formed which is heavier than
water and insoluble in it. This is the polysulphide of hydrogen:
MS<sub>5</sub> + 2HCl = MCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>. As Rebs showed (1888), whatever
polysulphide be taken&mdash;of sodium, for instance&mdash;it always gives one
and the same <i>hydrogen pentasulphide</i>,<a name="FNanchor_24_290" id="FNanchor_24_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_290" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of specific gravity 1·71 (15°).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
It can only be preserved in the absence of water and at low temperatures,
and then not for long: for, especially in the presence of alkalis
and when slightly warmed, it splits up very easily into sulphuretted
hydrogen and sulphur.<a name="FNanchor_25_291" id="FNanchor_25_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_291" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The soluble sulphides and polysulphides of the metals of the
alkalis and alkaline earths&mdash;for example, of ammonium,<a name="FNanchor_26_292" id="FNanchor_26_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_292" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> potassium,<a name="FNanchor_27_293" id="FNanchor_27_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_293" class="fnanchor">[27]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
and calcium,<a name="FNanchor_28_294" id="FNanchor_28_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_294" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>&mdash;have the appearance and properties of salts,
just as the hydrated oxides have, whilst the sulphides of the metals of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a><br /><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
higher groups resemble their oxides and have not at all the appearance
of salts, and this is more especially the case with regard to the crystalline
forms in which they frequently occur in nature.<a name="FNanchor_29_295" id="FNanchor_29_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_295" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>As the acids derived from chlorine, phosphorus, and carbon are
the oxidised hydrogen compounds of these elements, so also we can
form an idea of the acid hydrates of sulphur, or of <i>the normal acids
of sulphur</i>, by representing them as the oxidised products of sulphuretted
hydrogen&mdash;</p>

<p>In the case of chlorine, if not all the hydrates, at all events salts of
all the normal hydrates are known, whilst in the case of sulphur only
the acids H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are known. But, on the other hand,
the latter are obtained not only as hydrates but also as stable anhydrides,
SO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>3</sub>, which are formed with the evolution of heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
from sulphur and oxygen; 32 parts of sulphur in combining with
32 parts of oxygen&mdash;that is, in forming SO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;evolve 71,000 heat
units,<a name="FNanchor_31_297" id="FNanchor_31_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_297" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and if the oxidation proceeds to the formation of SO<sub>3</sub>, 103,000
heat units are evolved. These figures may be compared with those
which correspond with the passage of carbon into CO and CO<sub>2</sub>, when
29,000 and 97,000 units of heat are evolved. This determines the
stability of the higher oxides of sulphur, and also expresses the peculiarity
of sulphur as an element which, although an analogue of oxygen,
forms stable compounds with it, and thus fundamentally differs from
chlorine. The higher and lower oxides of chlorine are powerful oxidising
agents, whilst the higher oxide of sulphur, SO<sub>3</sub>, has but feeble
oxidising powers, and the lower oxide, SO<sub>2</sub>, frequently acts as a reducing
agent, and is formed by the direct combustion of sulphur, just
as carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, proceeds from the combustion of carbon.
In the combustion of sulphur, and also in the oxidation (roasting) of the
sulphides and polysulphides by their ignition in air, <i>sulphurous oxide</i>,
or <i>sulphurous anhydride</i>, or <i>sulphur dioxide</i>, SO<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_31_BIS_298" id="FNanchor_31_BIS_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_BIS_298" class="fnanchor">[31 bis]</a> is exclusively
formed. It is prepared on a large scale by burning sulphur or roasting
iron pyrites or other sulphides<a name="FNanchor_32_299" id="FNanchor_32_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_299" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> for the manufacture of sulphuric
acid (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_246">VI.</a>), and for direct application in the manufacture of
wine or for bleaching tissues and other purposes. In the latter instances
its application is based on the fact that sulphurous anhydride
acts on certain vegetable matters, and has the property of a reducing
and feeble acid.<a name="FNanchor_32_BIS_300" id="FNanchor_32_BIS_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_BIS_300" class="fnanchor">[32 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>In the laboratory&mdash;that is, on a small scale&mdash;sulphurous anhydride
is best prepared by deoxidising sulphuric acid by heating it with
charcoal, or copper, sulphur, mercury, &amp;c. Charcoal produces this
decomposition of sulphuric acid at but moderately high temperatures;
it is itself converted into carbonic anhydride,<a name="FNanchor_32_TRI_301" id="FNanchor_32_TRI_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_TRI_301" class="fnanchor">[32 tri]</a> and therefore when
sulphuric acid is heated with charcoal it evolves a mixture of sulphurous
and carbonic anhydrides: C + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2SO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. The
metals which are unable to decompose water, and which do not, therefore,
expel hydrogen from sulphuric acid, are frequently capable of
decomposing sulphuric acid, with the evolution of sulphurous anhydride,
just as they decompose nitric acid, forming the lower oxides of nitrogen.
These metals are silver, mercury, copper, lead, and others. Thus, for
example, the action of copper on sulphuric acid may be expressed by
the following equation: Cu + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = CuSO<sub>4</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. In
the laboratory this reaction is carried on in a flask with a gas-conducting
tube, and does not take place unless aided by heat.<a name="FNanchor_33_302" id="FNanchor_33_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_302" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In its physical and chemical properties sulphurous anhydride
presents a great <i>resemblance to carbonic anhydride</i>. It is a heavy gas,
somewhat considerably soluble in water, very easily condensed into a
liquid; it forms normal and acid salts, does not evolve oxygen under
the direct action of heat,<a name="FNanchor_34_303" id="FNanchor_34_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_303" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> although such metals as sodium and magnesium
burn in it, just as in carbonic anhydride. It has a suffocating
odour, which is well known owing to its being evolved when sulphur
or sulphur matches are burnt. In characterising the properties of
sulphurous anhydride, it is very important to remember (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_113">II.</a>)
also that it is more easily liquefied (at -10°, or at 0° under two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
atmospheres pressure) than carbonic anhydride (thirty-six atmospheres
at 0°),<a name="FNanchor_35_304" id="FNanchor_35_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_304" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that it is more soluble than carbonic anhydride (Vol. I.
p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_79">79</a>); at 0°, 100 vols. of water dissolve 180 vols. of carbonic
anhydride and 688 vols. of sulphuric anhydride), that the molecular
weight of SO<sub>2</sub> = 64 and of CO<sub>2</sub> = 44, and that the density of liquid sulphurous
anhydride at 0° = 1·43 (molecular volume = 45) and of carbonic
anhydride = 0·95 (molecular volume = 49). Although sulphur dioxide
is the anhydride of an acid, nevertheless, like carbonic anhydride, it does
not form any stable compounds with water, but gives a solution from
which it may be entirely expelled by the action of heat.<a name="FNanchor_36_305" id="FNanchor_36_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_305" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The acid
character of sulphurous anhydride is clearly expressed by the fact that
it is entirely absorbed by alkalis, with which it forms acid and normal
salts easily soluble in water. With salts of barium, calcium, and the
heavy metals, the normal salts of the alkalis, M<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, give precipitates
exactly like those formed by the carbonates. In general, the salts of
sulphurous acid are closely analogous to the corresponding carbonates.</p>

<p><i>Acid sodium sulphite</i>, NaHSO<sub>3</sub>, may be obtained by passing sulphurous
anhydride into a solution of sodium hydroxide. It is also
formed by saturating a solution of sodium carbonate with the gas
(carbonic anhydride is then given off), and as the solubility of the acid
sulphite is much greater than that of the carbonate, a further quantity
of the latter may be dissolved after the passage of the sulphurous
anhydride, so that ultimately a very strong solution of the sulphite
may be formed in this manner, from which it may be obtained in a
crystalline form, either by cooling and evaporating (without heating,
for then the salt would give off sulphurous anhydride) or by adding
alcohol to the solution. When exposed to the air this salt loses
sulphurous anhydride and attracts oxygen, which converts it into
sodium sulphate. The acid sulphites of the alkali metals are able to
combine not only with oxygen, but also with many other substances&mdash;for
example, a solution of the sodium salt dissolves sulphur, forming
sodium thiosulphate, gives crystalline compounds with the aldehydes
and ketones, and dissolves many bases, converting them into double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
sulphites. Having the faculty of attracting or absorbing oxygen, acid
sodium sulphite is also able to absorb chlorine, and is therefore
employed, like sodium thiosulphate, for the removal of chloride (as an
antichlor), especially in the bleaching of fabrics, when it is necessary
to remove the last traces of the chlorine held in the tissues, which
might otherwise have an injurious effect on them. If a solution of an
alkali hydroxide be divided into two parts, and one half is saturated
with sulphurous anhydride, and then the other half added to it, a
normal salt will be obtained in the solution, having an alkaline reaction,
like a solution of sodium carbonate. The acid salt has a neutral
reaction.<a name="FNanchor_36_BIS_306" id="FNanchor_36_BIS_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_BIS_306" class="fnanchor">[36 bis]</a> Like sodium carbonate, <i>normal sodium sulphite</i> has the
composition Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, and its maximum solubility is at 33°&mdash;in
a word, it very closely resembles sodium carbonate. Although this
salt does not give off sulphurous anhydride from its solution, it is able,
like the acid salt, to absorb oxygen from the air, and is then converted
into sodium sulphate.<a name="FNanchor_37_307" id="FNanchor_37_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_307" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Besides the acid character we must also point out the reducing
character of sulphurous anhydride. The reducing action of sulphurous
acid, its anhydride and salts, is due to their faculty of passing into
sulphuric acid and sulphates. The reducing action of the sulphites
is particularly energetic, so that they even convert nitric oxide into
nitrous oxide: K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> + 2NO = K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O. The salts of many of the
higher oxides are converted into those of the lower&mdash;for example, FeX<sub>3</sub>
into FeX<sub>2</sub>, CuX<sub>2</sub> into CuX, HgX<sub>2</sub> into HgX; thus 2FeX<sub>3</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O
= 2FeX<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2HX. In the presence of water, sulphurous
anhydride is oxidised by chlorine (SO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2HCl),
iodine, nitrous acid, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid, chloric acid,
and other oxygen compounds of the halogens, chromic, manganic, and
many other metallic acids and higher oxides, as well as all peroxides.
Free oxygen in the presence of spongy platinum is able to oxidise
sulphurous anhydride even in the absence of water, in which case
sulphuric anhydride SO<sub>3</sub> is formed, so that the latter may be prepared
by passing a mixture of sulphurous anhydride and oxygen over
incandescent spongy platinum, or, as it is now prepared on a large scale
in chemical works, by passing this mixture over asbestos or pumice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
stone moistened with a solution of platinum salt and ignited. Sulphurous
anhydride is completely absorbed by certain higher oxides&mdash;for
instance, by barium peroxide and lead dioxide (PbO<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> = PbSO<sub>4</sub>).<a name="FNanchor_38_308" id="FNanchor_38_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_308" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>There are, however, cases where sulphurous anhydride acts as an
oxidising agent&mdash;that is, it is <i>deoxidised</i> in the presence of substances
which are capable of absorbing oxygen with still greater energy than
the sulphurous anhydride itself. This oxidising action proceeds with
the formation of sulphuretted hydrogen or of sulphides, while the
reducing agent is oxidised at the expense of the oxygen of the sulphurous
anhydride. In this respect, the action of stannous salts is
particularly remarkable. Stannous chloride, SnCl<sub>2</sub>, in an aqueous
solution gives a precipitate of stannic sulphide, SnS<sub>2</sub>, with sulphurous
anhydride&mdash;that is, the latter is deoxidised to sulphuretted hydrogen,
while SnX<sub>2</sub> is oxidised into SnX<sub>4</sub>. A solution of sulphurous anhydride
has also an oxidising action on zinc. The zinc passes into solution, but no
hydrogen is evolved,<a name="FNanchor_39_309" id="FNanchor_39_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_309" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> because a salt of <i>hydrosulphurous acid</i>, ZnS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,
is formed. The free acid is still less stable than the salt.</p>

<p>The faculty of sulphurous anhydride of combining with various
substances is evident from the above-cited reactions, where it combines
with hydrogen and with oxygen, and this faculty also appears in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
fact that, like carbonic oxide, it combines with chlorine, forming a
chloranhydride of sulphuric acid, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, to which we shall afterwards
return. The same faculty for combination also appears in the salts of
sulphurous acid, in their liability to oxidation and in the exceedingly
characteristic formation of a peculiar series of salts obtained by Pelouze
and Frémy. At a temperature of -10° or below, nitric oxide NO is
absorbed by alkaline solutions of the alkali sulphites, forming a peculiar
series of <i>nitrosulphates</i>. At a higher temperature these salts are not
formed but the nitric oxide is reduced to nitrous oxide. But in the
cold the liquid saturated with nitric oxide after a certain time gives
prismatic crystals resembling those of nitre. The composition of the
potassium salt is K<sub>2</sub>SN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, the salt contains the elements of
potassium sulphite and of nitric oxide.<a name="FNanchor_40_310" id="FNanchor_40_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_310" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>There are also several other substances, formed by the oxides of
nitrogen and sulphur, which belong to this class of complex and, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
some circumstances, unstable compounds. In the manufacture of
sulphuric acid, both these classes of oxides come into contact with each
other in the lead chambers, and if there be insufficient water for the
formation of sulphuric acid they give crystalline compounds, termed
<i>chamber crystals</i>. As a rule, the composition of the crystals is expressed
by the formula NHSO<sub>3</sub>. This is a compound of the radicles
NO<sub>2</sub> of nitric acid, and HSO<sub>3</sub> of sulphuric acid, or nitro-sulphuric
acid, NO<sub>2</sub>.SHO<sub>3</sub>, if sulphuric acid be expressed as OH.SHO<sub>3</sub> and nitric
by NO<sub>2</sub>.OH. The tabular crystals of this substance fuse at about 70°,
are formed both by the direct action of nitrous anhydride or nitric
peroxide (but not NO, which is not absorbed by sulphuric acid) on
sulphuric acid (Weltzien and others), and especially on sulphuric acid
containing an anhydride and the lower oxides of sulphur and nitric acid.<a name="FNanchor_41_311" id="FNanchor_41_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_311" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><i>Thiosulphuric acid</i>, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, a compound of sulphurous acid
and sulphur&mdash;also belongs to the products of combination of sulphurous
acid. In the same way that sulphurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, gives H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with
oxygen, so it gives H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with sulphur. In a free state it is very unstable,
and it is only known in the form of its salts proceeding from the
direct action of sulphur on the normal sulphites; if endeavours be
made to separate it in a free state, it immediately splits up into those
elements from which it might be formed&mdash;that is, into sulphur and
sulphurous acid. The most important of its salts is the <i>sodium
thiosulphate</i> (known as hyposulphite), Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, which occurs in
colourless crystals, and is unacted on by atmospheric oxygen either
when in a dry state or in solution. Many other salts of this acid are
easily formed by means of this salt,<a name="FNanchor_41_BIS_312" id="FNanchor_41_BIS_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_BIS_312" class="fnanchor">[41 bis]</a> although this cannot be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
with all bases, for such bases as alumina, ferric oxide, chromium oxide,
and others do not give compounds with thiosulphuric acid, just as they
do not form stable compounds with carbonic acid. Whenever these
salts might be formed, they (like the acid) split up into sulphurous acid
and sulphur, and furthermore the elements of thiosulphuric acid in
many cases act in a reducing manner, forming sulphuric acid and
taking up the oxygen from reducible oxides. Thus when treated with
a thiosulphate the soluble ferric salts give a precipitate of sulphur and
form ferrous salts. The thiosulphates of the metals of the alkalis are
obtained directly by boiling a solution of their sulphites with sulphur:
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> + S = Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The same salts are formed by the action of
sulphurous anhydride on solutions of the sulphides; thus sodium
sulphide dissolved in water gives sulphur and sodium thiosulphate
when a stream of sulphurous anhydride is passed through it: 2Na<sub>2</sub>S
+ 3SO<sub>2</sub> = 2Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + S. The polysulphides of the alkali metals
when left exposed to the air attract oxygen and also form thiosulphates.<a name="FNanchor_42_313" id="FNanchor_42_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_313" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Although sulphur, oxidising at a high temperature, only forms a
small quantity of sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, and nearly all passes into
sulphurous anhydride, still the latter may be converted into the higher
oxide, or <i>sulphuric anhydride</i>, SO<sub>3</sub>, by many methods. Sulphuric
anhydride is a solid crystalline substance at the ordinary temperature;
it is easily fusible (15°), and volatile (46°), and rapidly attracts moisture.
Although it is formed by the combination of sulphurous anhydride
with oxygen, it is capable of further combination. Thus it combines
with water, hydrochloric acid, ammonia, with many hydrocarbons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
and even with sulphuric acid, boric and nitrous anhydrides, &amp;c., and
also with bases which burn directly in its vapour, forming sulphates in
the presence of traces of moisture (<i>see</i> Chapter IX., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_29_544">29</a>). The
oxidation of sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, into sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>,
is effected by passing a mixture of the former and dry oxygen or
air over incandescent spongy platinum. An increase of pressure
accelerates the reaction (Hanisch). If the product be passed into a
cold vessel, crystalline sulphuric anhydride is deposited upon the sides of
the vessel, but as it is difficult to avoid all traces of moisture it always
contains compounds of its hydrates: H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>13</sub>, whose
presence so modifies the properties of the anhydride (Weber) that
formerly two modifications of the anhydride were recognised. The
same sulphuric anhydride may be obtained from certain anhydrous
sulphates, or those which are almost so, which are decomposed by heat,
whilst an impure but perfectly anhydrous anhydride is formed by
distillation over phosphoric anhydride. For instance, acid sodium
sulphate, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, and the pyro- or di-sulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (Chapter
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_513">XII.</a>) formed from it, when ignited evolve sulphuric anhydride. Green
vitriol&mdash;that is, ferrous sulphate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;belongs to the number of
those sulphates which easily give off sulphuric anhydride under the
action of heat. It contains water of crystallisation and parts with it
when it is heated, but the last equivalent of water is driven off with
difficulty, just as is the case with magnesium sulphate, MgSO<sub>4</sub>7H<sub>2</sub>O;
however, when thoroughly heated, this evolution of sulphuric anhydride
does take place, although not completely, because at a high temperature a
portion of it is decomposed by the ferrous oxide (SO<sub>3</sub> + 2FeO), which
is converted into ferric oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and in consequence part of the
sulphuric anhydride is converted into sulphurous anhydride. Thus the
products of the decomposition of ferrous sulphate will be: ferric oxide,
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, and sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>,
according to the equation: 2FeSO<sub>4</sub> = Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub>. As water
still remains with the ferrous sulphate when it is heated, the result will
partially consist of the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, with anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, dissolved
in it. Sulphuric acid was for a long time prepared in this manner;
the process was formerly carried on on a large scale in the neighbourhood
of Nordhausen, and hence the sulphuric acid prepared from
ferrous sulphate is called <i>fuming Nordhausen acid</i>. At the present
time the fuming acid is prepared by passing the volatile products of the
decomposition of ferrous sulphate through strong sulphuric acid prepared
by the ordinary method. The sulphurous anhydride is insoluble
in it, but it absorbs the sulphuric anhydride. Sulphuric anhydride
may be prepared not only by igniting FeSO<sub>4</sub> or sodium pyrosulphate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (the decomposition proceeds at 600°), but also by heating
a mixture of the latter and MgSO<sub>4</sub> (Walters); in the former case a
stable double salt MgNa<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> finally remains. It is also obtained
by the direct combination of SO<sub>2</sub> and O under the action of spongy
platinum or asbestos coated with platinum black (C. Winkler's process).
Nordhausen sulphuric acid fumes in air, owing to its containing
and easily giving off sulphuric anhydride, and it is therefore also called
<i>fuming sulphuric acid</i>; these fumes are nothing but the vapour of
sulphuric anhydride combining with the moisture in the air and forming
non-volatile sulphuric acid (hydrate).<a name="FNanchor_43_314" id="FNanchor_43_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_314" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Nordhausen sulphuric acid contains a peculiar compound of SO<sub>3</sub>
and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or <i>pyrosulphuric acid</i>; an imperfect anhydride of sulphuric
acid, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, analogous in composition with the salts Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,
K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and bearing the same relation to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> that pyrophosphoric
acid does to H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. The bond holding the sulphuric acid and
anhydride together is unstable. This is obvious from the fact that the
anhydride may easily be separated from this compound, by the action of
heat. In order to obtain the definite compound, the Nordhausen acid
is cooled to 5°, or, better still, a portion of it is distilled until all the
anhydride and a certain amount of sulphuric acid have passed over into
the distillate, which will then solidify at the ordinary temperature,
because the compound H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,SO<sub>3</sub> fuses at 35°. Although this substance
reacts on water, bases, &amp;c., like a mixture of SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
since a definite compound, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, exists in a free state and gives salts
and a chloranhydride, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_44_315" id="FNanchor_44_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_315" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> we must admit the existence of a
definite pyrosulphuric acid, like pyrophosphoric acid, only that the
latter has a far greater stability and is not even converted into a perfect
hydrate by water. Further, the salts M<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> dissolved in water react
in the same manner as the acid salts MHSO<sub>4</sub>, whilst the imperfect
hydrates of phosphoric acid (for example, PHO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) have independent
reactions even in an aqueous solution which distinguish them
and their salts from the perfect hydrates.</p>

<p><i>Sulphuric acid</i>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, is formed by the combination of its anhydride,
SO<sub>3</sub>, and water, with the evolution of a large amount of heat;
the reaction SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O develops 21,300 heat units. The method of its
preparation on a large scale, and most of the methods employed
for its formation, are dependent on the oxidation of sulphurous
anhydride, and the formation of sulphuric anhydride, which forms
sulphuric acid under the action of water. The technical method of its
manufacture has been described in Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_246">VI.</a> The acid obtained
<i>from the lead chambers</i> contains a considerable amount of water, and
is also impure owing to the presence of oxides of nitrogen, lead compounds,
and certain impurities from the burnt sulphur which have
come over in a gaseous and vaporous state (for example, arsenic compounds).
For practical purposes, hardly any notice is taken of the
majority of these impurities, because they do not interfere with its general
qualities. Most frequently endeavours are only made to remove, as far
as possible, all the water which can be expelled.<a name="FNanchor_45_316" id="FNanchor_45_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_316" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> That is, the object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
is to obtain the hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, from the dilute acid (60 per cent.),
and this is effected by evaporation by means of heat. Every given
mixture of water and sulphuric acid begins to part with a certain
amount of aqueous vapour when heated to a certain definite temperature.
At a low temperature either there is no evaporation of water, or there
can even be an absorption of moisture from the air. As the removal
of the water proceeds, the vapour tension of the residue decreases for
the same temperature, and therefore the more dilute the acid the lower
the temperature at which it gives up a portion of its water. In consequence
of this, the removal of water from dilute solutions of sulphuric
acid may be easily carried on (up to 75 p.c. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) in lead vessels,
because at low temperatures dilute sulphuric acid does not attack lead.
But as the acid becomes more concentrated the temperature at which
the water comes over becomes higher and higher, and then the acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
begins to act on lead (with the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen and
conversion of the lead into sulphate), and therefore lead vessels cannot
be employed for the complete removal of the water. For this purpose
the evaporation is generally carried on in glass or platinum retorts, like
those depicted in figs. 87 and 88.</p>

<p><i>The concentration of sulphuric acid</i> in glass retorts is not a continuous
process, and consists of heating the dilute 75 per cent. acid
until it ceases to give off aqueous vapour, and until acid containing
93&ndash;98 per cent. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (66° Baumé) is obtained&mdash;and this takes place
when the temperature reaches 320° and the density of the residue
reaches 1·847 (66° Baumé).<a name="FNanchor_46_317" id="FNanchor_46_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_317" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The platinum vessels designed for the
continuous concentration of sulphuric acid consist of a still <i>B</i>, furnished
with a still head <i>E</i>, a connecting pipe <i>E F</i>, and a syphon tube <i>H R</i>,
which draws off the sulphuric acid concentrated in the boiler. A stream
of sulphuric acid previously concentrated in lead retorts to a density of
about 60° Baumé&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to 75 per cent. or a sp. gr. of 1·7&mdash;runs continuously
into the retort through a syphon funnel <i>E&#8242;</i>. The apparatus is fed
from above, because the acid freshly supplied is lighter than that which
has already lost water, and also because the water is more easily
evaporated from the freshly supplied acid at the surface. The platinum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
retort is heated, and the steam coming off<a name="FNanchor_47_318" id="FNanchor_47_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_318" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> is condensed in a worm
<i>F G</i>, whilst as fresh dilute acid is supplied to the boiler the acid already
concentrated is drawn off through the syphon tube <i>H B</i>, which is
furnished with a regulating cock by means of which the outflow of the
concentrated acid from the bottom of the retort can be so regulated
that it will always present one and the same specific gravity, corresponding
with the strength required. For this purpose the acid flowing
from the syphon is collected in a receiver <i>R</i>, in which a hydrometer,
indicating its density, floats; if its density be less than 66° Baumé,
the regulating cock is closed sufficiently to retard the outflow of sulphuric
acid, so as to lengthen the time of its evaporation in the retort.<a name="FNanchor_48_319" id="FNanchor_48_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_319" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, <i>sulphuric acid is not volatile</i>, and at its so-called
boiling-point it really decomposes into its anhydride and water; its
boiling-point (338°) being nothing else but its temperature of decomposition.
The products of this decomposition are substances boiling
much below the temperature of the decomposition of sulphuric acid.
This conclusion with regard to the process of the distillation of sulphuric
acid may be deduced from Bineau's observations on the vapour-density
of sulphuric acid. This density referred to hydrogen proved
to be half that which sulphuric acid should have according to its
molecular weight, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, in which case it should be 49, whilst the
observed density was equal to 24·5. Besides which, Marignac showed
that the first portions of the sulphuric acid distilling over contain less
of the elements of water than the portion which remains behind, or
which distils over towards the end. This is explained by the fact that
on distillation the sulphuric acid is decomposed, but a portion of the
water proceeding from its decomposition is retained by the remaining
mass of sulphuric acid, and therefore at first a mixture of sulphuric
acid and sulphuric anhydride&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> fuming sulphuric acid&mdash;is obtained
in the distillate. It is possible by repeating the distillation several times
and only collecting the first portions of the distillate, to obtain a
distinctly fuming acid. To obtain the definite hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> it is
necessary to refrigerate a highly concentrated acid, of as great a purity
as possible, to which a small quantity of sulphuric anhydride has been
previously added. Sulphuric acid containing a small quantity (a fraction
of a per cent. by weight) of water only freezes at a very low temperature,
while the pure normal acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, solidifies when it is cooled below 0°,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and therefore the normal acid first crystallises out from the concentrated
sulphuric acid. By repeating the refrigeration several times,
and pouring off the unsolidified portion, it is possible to obtain a pure
<i>normal hydrate</i>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, which melts at 10°·4. Even at 40° it gives off
distinct fumes&mdash;that is, it begins to evolve sulphuric anhydride, which
volatilises, and therefore even in a dry atmosphere the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
becomes weaker, until it contains 1&frac12; p.c. of water.<a name="FNanchor_49_320" id="FNanchor_49_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_320" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In a concentrated form sulphuric acid is commercially known as <i>oil
of vitriol</i>, because for a long time it was obtained from green vitriol and
because it has an oily appearance and flows from one vessel into another
in a thick and somewhat sluggish stream, like the majority of oily
substances, and in this clearly differs from such liquids as water, spirit,
ether, and the like, which exhibit a far greater mobility. Among its
reactions the first to be remarked is its faculty for the formation of
many compounds. We already know that it combines with its anhydride,
and with the sulphates of the alkali metals; that it is soluble in
water, with which it forms more or less stable compounds. Sulphuric
acid, when mixed with water, develops a very considerable amount of
heat.<a name="FNanchor_50_321" id="FNanchor_50_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_321" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Besides the normal hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, <i>another definite hydrate</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O (84·48 per cent. of the normal hydrate, and 15·52 per cent.
of water) is known; it crystallises<a name="FNanchor_50_BIS_322" id="FNanchor_50_BIS_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_BIS_322" class="fnanchor">[50 bis]</a> extremely easily in large six-sided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
prisms, which form above 0°&mdash;namely, at about +8°·5; when
heated to 210° it loses water.<a name="FNanchor_51_323" id="FNanchor_51_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_323" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> If the hydrates H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O
exist at low temperatures as definite crystalline compounds, and if
pyrosulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, has the same property, and if they all
decompose with more or less ease on a rise of temperature, with the
disengagement of either SO<sub>3</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O, and in their ordinary form
present all the properties of simple solutions, it follows that between
sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, and water, H<sub>2</sub>O, there exists a consecutive
series of homogeneous liquids or solutions, among which we
must distinguish <i>definite compounds</i>, and therefore it is quite justifiable
to look for other definite compounds between SO<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, beyond the
conditions for a change of state. In this respect we may be guided by
the variation of properties of any kind, proceeding concurrently with a
variation in the composition of a solution.</p>

<p>But only a few properties have been determined with sufficient
accuracy. In those properties which have been determined for many
solutions of sulphuric acid, it is actually seen that the above-mentioned
definite compounds are distinguished by distinctive marks of change.
As an example we may cite the variation of the specific gravity with a
variation of temperature (namely K = <i>ds/dt</i>, if <i>s</i> be the sp. gr. and <i>t</i> the
temperature). For the normal hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, this factor is easily
determined from the fact that&mdash;</p>

<p class="title"><i>s</i> = 18528 - 10·65<i>t</i> + 0·013<i>t</i><sup>2</sup>,</p>

<p class="noindent">where <i>s</i> is the specific gravity at <i>t</i> (degrees Celsius) if the sp. gr. of
water at 4° = 10,000. Therefore K = 10·65 - 0·026<i>t</i>. This means that
at 0° the sp. gr. of the acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> decreases by 10·65 for every rise of
a degree of temperature, at 10° by 10·39, at 20° by 10·13, at 30° by
9·87.<a name="FNanchor_52_324" id="FNanchor_52_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_324" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> And for solutions containing slightly more anhydride than
the acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (<i>i.e.</i> for fuming sulphuric acid), as well as for solutions
containing more water, K is greater than for the acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Thus for
the solution SO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, at 10° K = 11·0. On diluting the acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
K again increases until the formation of the solution H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O
(K = 11·1 at 10°), and then, on further dilution with water, it again
decreases. Consequently both hydrates H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O are
here expressed by an alteration of the magnitude of K.</p>

<p>This shows that in liquid solutions it is possible by studying the
variation of their properties (without a change of physical state) to
recognise the presence or formation of definite hydrate compounds,
and therefore an exact investigation of the properties of solutions, of
their specific gravity for instance, should give direct indications of such

<p>The figures in these tables give the means of finding the amount
of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> contained in a solution from its specific gravity,<a name="FNanchor_55_329" id="FNanchor_55_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_329" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and also
show that &lsquo;special points&rsquo; in the lines of variation of the specific gravity
with the temperature and percentage composition correspond to certain
definite compounds of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with OH<sub>2</sub>. This is best seen in the
variation of the factors (<i>d</i>S/<i>dt</i> and <i>d</i>S/<i>dp</i>) with the temperature and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
composition (columns 3, 4, second table). We have already mentioned
how the factor of temperature points to the existence of hydrates,
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. As regards the factor <i>d</i>S/<i>dp</i> (giving the
increase of sp. gr. with an increase of 1 per cent. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) the following
are the three most salient points: (1) In passing from 98 per cent. to
100 per cent. the factor is negative, and at 100 per cent. about -0·0019
(<i>i.e.</i> at 99 per cent. the sp. gr. is about 1·8391, and at 100 per cent.
about 1·8372, at 15°, the amount of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> has increased whilst the
sp. gr. has decreased), but as soon as a certain amount of SO<sub>3</sub> is
added to the definite compound H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (and &lsquo;fuming&rsquo; acid formed)
the specific gravity rises (for example, for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> 0·136 SO<sub>3</sub> the sp. gr.
at 15° = 1·866), that is the factor becomes positive (and, in fact, greater
by +0·01), so that the formation of the definite hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is
accompanied by a distinct and considerable break in the continuity
of the factor<a name="FNanchor_55_BIS_330" id="FNanchor_55_BIS_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_BIS_330" class="fnanchor">[55 bis]</a>; (2) The factor (<i>d</i>S/<i>dp</i>) in increasing in its passage
from dilute to concentrated solutions, attains a maximum value (at 15°
about 0·012) about H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O, <i>i.e.</i> at about the hydrate corresponding
to the form SX<sub>6</sub>; proper to the compounds of sulphur, for S(OH)<sub>6</sub>
= H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O; the same hydrate corresponds to the composition of
gypsum CaSO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O, and to it also corresponds the greatest contraction
and rise of temperature in mixing H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>see</i> Chapter I.,
Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_28_37">28</a>); (3) The variation of the factor (<i>d</i>S/<i>dp</i>) under certain variations
in the composition proceeds so uniformly and regularly, and is so
different from the variation given under other proportions of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>O, that the sum of the variations of <i>d</i>S/<i>dp</i> is expressed by a series
of straight lines, if the values of <i>p</i> be laid along the axis of abscissæ
and those of <i>d</i>S/<i>dp</i> along the ordinates.<a name="FNanchor_56_331" id="FNanchor_56_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_331" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Thus, for instance, for 15°, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
10 per cent. <i>d</i>S/<i>dp</i> = 0·0071, at 20 per cent. = 0·0077, at 30 per cent.
= 0·0082, at 40 per cent. = 0·0088, that is, for each 10 per cent. the
factor increases by about 0·0006 for the whole of the above range, but
beyond this it becomes larger, and then, after passing H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O,
it begins to fall rapidly. Such changes in the variation of the factor
take place apparently about definite hydrates,<a name="FNanchor_56_BIS_332" id="FNanchor_56_BIS_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_BIS_332" class="fnanchor">[56 bis]</a> and especially
about H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O. All this indicating
as it does the special chemical affinity of sulphuric acid for water,
although of no small significance for comprehending the nature of solutions
(<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_40">I.</a> and Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_299">VII.</a>), contains many special points
which require detailed investigation, the chief difficulty being that it
requires great accuracy in a large number of experimental data.</p>

<p>The great affinity of sulphuric acid for water is also seen from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the fact that when the strong acid acts on the majority of <i>organic
substances</i> containing hydrogen and oxygen (especially on heating) it
very frequently <i>takes up these elements in the form of water</i>. Thus
strong sulphuric acid acting on alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, removes the elements
of water from it, and converts it into olefiant gas, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. It acts in a
similar manner on wood and other vegetable tissues, which it chars.
If a piece of wood be immersed in strong sulphuric acid it turns black.
This is owing to the fact that the wood contains carbohydrates which
give up hydrogen and oxygen as water to the sulphuric acid, leaving
charcoal, or a black mass very rich in it. For example, cellulose,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, acts in this manner.<a name="FNanchor_57_333" id="FNanchor_57_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_333" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>We have already had frequent occasion to notice the very
<i>energetic acid properties</i> of sulphuric acid, and therefore we will now
only consider a few of their aspects. First of all we must remember
that, with calcium, strontium, and especially with barium and lead,
sulphuric acid forms very slightly soluble salts, whilst with the
majority of other metals it gives more easily soluble salts, which in the
majority of cases are able, like sulphuric acid itself, to combine with
water to form crystallo-hydrates. Normal sulphuric acid, containing
two atoms of hydrogen in its molecule, is able for this reason alone
to form two classes of salts, <i>normal</i> and <i>acid</i>, which it does with great
facility <i>with the alkali metals</i>. The metals of the alkaline earths
and the majority of other metals, if they do form acid sulphates, do so
under exceptional conditions (with an excess of strong sulphuric acid),
and these salts when formed are decomposable by water&mdash;that is,
although having a certain degree of physical stability they have no
chemical stability. Besides the acid salts RHSO<sub>4</sub>, sulphuric acid also
gives other forms of acid salts. An entire series of salts having the
composition RHSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or for bivalent metals RSO<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_58_334" id="FNanchor_58_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_334" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
has been prepared. Such salts have been obtained for potassium,
sodium, nickel, calcium, silver, magnesium, manganese. They are prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
by dissolving the sulphates in an excess of sulphuric acid and
heating the solution until the excess of sulphuric acid is driven off;
on cooling, the mass solidifies to a crystalline salt. Besides which,
Rose obtained a salt having the composition Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, and if
HNaSO<sub>4</sub> be heated it easily forms a salt Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,SO<sub>3</sub>;
hence it is clear that sulphuric anhydride combines with various proportions
of bases, just as it combines with various proportions of
water.</p>

<p>We have already learned that sulphuric acid displaces the acid from
the salts of nitric, carbonic, and many other volatile acids. Berthollet's
laws (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_417">X.</a>) explain this by the small volatility of sulphuric
acid; and, indeed, in an aqueous solution sulphuric acid displaces the
much less soluble boric acid from its compounds&mdash;for instance, from
borax, and it also displaces silica from its compounds with bases; but
both boric anhydride and silica, when fused with sulphates, decompose
them, displacing sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, because they are less
volatile than sulphuric anhydride. It is also well known that with
metals, sulphuric acid forms salts giving off hydrogen (Fe, Zn, &amp;c.), or
sulphur dioxide (Cu, Hg, &amp;c.).<a name="FNanchor_58_BIS_335" id="FNanchor_58_BIS_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_BIS_335" class="fnanchor">[58 bis]</a></p>

<p>The reactions of sulphuric acid <i>with respect to organic substances</i>
are generally determined by its acid character, when the direct extraction
of water, or oxidation at the expense of the oxygen of the
sulphuric acid,<a name="FNanchor_59_336" id="FNanchor_59_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_336" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> or disintegration does not take place. Thus the
majority of the saturated hydrocarbons, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>m</i></sub>, form with sulphuric
acid a special class of <i>sulphonic acids</i>, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>m</i>-1</sub>(HSO<sub>3</sub>); for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, forms benzenesulphonic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.SO<sub>3</sub>H, water being
separated, for the formation of which oxygen is taken up from the
sulphuric acid, for the product contains less oxygen than the sulphuric
acid. It is evident from the existence of these acids that the hydrogen in
organic compounds is replaceable by the group SO<sub>3</sub>H, just as it may be
replaced by the radicles Cl, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>H and others. As the radicle
of sulphuric acid or <i>sulphoxyl</i>, SO<sub>2</sub>OH or SHO<sub>3</sub>, contains, like carboxyl
(Vol. I., p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_395">395</a>), one hydrogen (hydroxyl) of sulphuric acid, the
resultant substances are acids whose basicity is equal to the number
of hydrogens replaced by sulphoxyl. Since also sulphoxyl takes the
place of hydrogen, and itself contains hydrogen, the sulpho-acids are
equal to a hydrocarbon + SO<sub>3</sub>, just as every organic (carboxylic) acid
is equal to a hydrocarbon + CO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, here this relation corresponds
with actual fact, because many sulphonic acids are obtained
by the direct combination of sulphuric anhydride: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>,(SO<sub>3</sub>H)
= C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub>. The sulphonic acids give soluble barium salts, and
are therefore easily distinguished from sulphuric acid. They are
soluble in water, are not volatile, and when distilled give sulphurous
anhydride (whilst the hydroxyl previously in combination with the
sulphurous anhydride remains in the hydrocarbon group; thus phenol,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.OH, is obtained from benzenesulphonic acid), and they are very
energetic, because the hydrogen acting in them is of the same nature as
in sulphuric acid itself.<a name="FNanchor_60_337" id="FNanchor_60_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_337" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Sulphuric acid, as containing a large proportion of oxygen, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
substance which frequently acts as an oxidising agent: in which case
it is <i>deoxidised, forming sulphurous anhydride</i> and water (or even,
although more rarely, sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphur). Sulphuric
acid acts in this manner on charcoal, copper, mercury, silver, organic
and other substances, which are unable to evolve hydrogen from it
directly, as we saw in describing sulphurous anhydride.</p>

<p>Although the hydrate of a higher saline form of oxidation (Chapter
<a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>), sulphuric anhydride is capable of further oxidation, and forms a
kind of peroxide, just as hydrogen gives hydrogen peroxide in addition
to water, or as sodium and potassium, besides the oxides Na<sub>2</sub>O and
K<sub>2</sub>O, give their peroxides, compounds which are in a chemical sense
unstable, powerfully oxidising, and not directly able to enter into saline
combinations. If the oxides of potassium, barium, &amp;c., be compared
to water, then their peroxides must in like manner correspond to
hydrogen peroxide,<a name="FNanchor_61_338" id="FNanchor_61_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_338" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> not only because the oxygen contained in them
is very mobile and easily liberated, and because their reactions are
similar, but also because they can be mutually transformed into each
other, and are able to form compounds with each other, with bases
and with water, and indeed form a kind of peroxide salts.<a name="FNanchor_62_339" id="FNanchor_62_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_339" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> This
is also the character of <i>persulphuric acid</i>, discovered in 1878 by
Berthelot, and its corresponding anhydride or peroxide of sulphur S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>.
It is formed from 2SO<sub>3</sub> + O with the absorption of heat (-27
thousand heat units), like ozone from O<sub>2</sub> + O (-29 thousand units of
heat), or hydrogen peroxide from H<sub>2</sub>O + O (-21 thousand heat units).</p>

<p>Peroxide of sulphur is produced by the action of a silent discharge
upon a mixture of oxygen and sulphurous anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_63_340" id="FNanchor_63_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_340" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> With water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> gives persulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. The latter is obtained
more simply by mixing strong sulphuric acid (not weaker than
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O) directly with hydrogen peroxide, or by the action of a
galvanic current on sulphuric acid mixed with a certain amount of water,
and cooled, the electrodes being platinum wires, when persulphuric acid
naturally appears at the positive pole.<a name="FNanchor_64_341" id="FNanchor_64_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_341" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> When an acid of the strength
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O is taken, at first the hydrate of the sulphuric peroxide,
S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O only is formed; but when the concentration about
the positive pole reaches H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide
and the hydrate of sulphuric peroxide begins to be formed. Dilute
solutions of sulphuric peroxide can be kept better than more concentrated
solutions, but the latter may be obtained containing as
much as 123 grams of the peroxide to a litre. It is a very instructive
fact that hydrogen peroxide is always formed when strong solutions of
persulphuric acid break up on keeping. So that the bond between the
two peroxides is established both by analysis and synthesis: hydrogen
peroxide is able to produce S<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and the latter to produce hydrogen
peroxide. A mixture of sulphuric peroxide with sulphuric acid or
water is immediately decomposed, with the evolution of oxygen, either
when heated or under the action of spongy platinum. The same thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
takes place with a solution of baryta, although at first no precipitate is
formed and the decomposition of the barium salt, BaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, with the formation
of BaSO<sub>4</sub>, only proceeds slowly, so that the solution may be
filtered (the barium salt of persulphuric acid is soluble in water). Mercury,
ferrous oxide, and the stannous salts, are oxidised by S<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.
These are all distinct signs of true peroxides. The same common properties
(capacity for oxidising, property of forming peroxide of hydrogen,
&amp;c.) are possessed by the alkali salts of persulphuric acid, which are
obtained by the action of an electric current upon certain sulphates,
for instance ammonium or potassium sulphate. The ammonium salt
of persulphuric acid, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, is especially easily formed by this
means, and is now prepared on a large scale and used (like Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for bleaching tissues and fibres.<a name="FNanchor_65_342" id="FNanchor_65_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_342" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to understand the relation of sulphuric peroxide to sulphuric
acid we must first remark that hydrogen peroxide is to be considered,
in accordance with the law of substitution, as water, H(OH), in which
H is replaced by (OH). Now the relation of H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is
exactly similar. The radicle of sulphuric acid, equivalent to hydrogen,
is HSO<sub>4</sub>;<a name="FNanchor_65_BIS_343" id="FNanchor_65_BIS_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_BIS_343" class="fnanchor">[65 bis]</a> it corresponds with the (OH) of water, and therefore
sulphuric acid, H(SHO<sub>4</sub>), gives (SHO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> or S<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, in exactly the same
manner as water gives (HO)<sub>2</sub>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_66_344" id="FNanchor_66_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_344" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The largest part <i>of the sulphuric acid made</i> is used for reacting
on sodium chloride in the manufacture of sodium carbonate; for the
manufacture of the volatile acids, like nitric, hydrochloric, &amp;c., from
their corresponding salts; for the preparation of ammonium sulphate,
alums, vitriols (copper and iron), artificial manures, superphosphate
(Chapter XIX., Note <a href="#Footnote_18_223">18</a>) and other salts of sulphuric acid; in the treatment
of bone ash for the preparation of phosphorus, and for the solution
of metals&mdash;for example, of silver in its separation from gold&mdash;for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
cleaning metals from rust, &amp;c. A large amount of oil of vitriol is also
used in treatment of organic substances; it is used for the extraction
of stearin, or stearic acid, from tallow, for refining petroleum and
various vegetable oils, in the preparation of nitro-glycerine (Chapter VI.,
Notes <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_37_368">37</a> and <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_37_BIS_369">37 bis</a>), for dissolving indigo and other colouring matters,
for the conversion of paper into vegetable parchment, for the preparation
of ether from alcohol, for the preparation of various artificial scents
from fusel oil, for the preparation of vegetable acids, such as oxalic,
tartaric, citric, for the conversion of non-fermentable starchy substances
into fermentable glucose, and in a number of other processes. It
would be difficult to find another artificially-prepared substance
which is so frequently applied in the arts as sulphuric acid. Where
there are not works for its manufacture, the economical production of
many other substances of great technical importance is impossible.
In those localities which have arrived at a high technical activity
the amount of sulphuric acid consumed is proportionally large;
sulphuric acid, sodium carbonate, and lime are the most important of
the artificially-prepared agents employed in factories.</p>

<p>Besides the normal acids of sulphur, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>S, and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
corresponding with sulphuretted hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>S, in the same way
that the oxy-acids of chlorine correspond with hydrochloric acid, HCl,
there exists a peculiar series of acids which are termed <i>thionic acids</i>.
Their general composition is S<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, where <i>n</i> varies from 2 to 5. If
<i>n</i> = 2, the acid is called dithionic acid. The others are distinguished
as trithionic, tetrathionic, and pentathionic acids. Their composition,
existence, and reactions are very easily understood if they be referred
to the class of the sulphonic acids&mdash;that is, if their relation to
sulphuric acid be expressed in just the same manner as the relation of
the organic acids to carbonic acid. The organic acids, as we saw
(Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_379">IX.</a>), proceed from the hydrocarbons by the substitution of
their hydrogen by carboxyl&mdash;that is, by the radicle of carbonic acid,
CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> - HO = CHO<sub>2</sub>. The formation of the acids of sulphur by
means of sulphoxyl may be represented in the same manner, HSO<sub>3</sub>
= H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> - HO. Therefore to hydrogen H<sub>2</sub>, there should correspond the
acids H.SHO<sub>3</sub>, sulphurous, and SHO<sub>3</sub>.SHO<sub>3</sub> = S<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, or dithionic;
to SH<sub>2</sub> there should correspond the acids SH(SHO<sub>3</sub>) = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (thiosulphuric),
and S(SHO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (trithionic); to S<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> the acids
S<sub>2</sub>H(SHO<sub>3</sub>) = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (unknown), and S<sub>2</sub>(SHO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (tetrathionic);
to S<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub> the acids S<sub>3</sub>H(SHO<sub>3</sub>) and S<sub>3</sub>(SHO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
(pentathionic). We know that iodine reacts directly with the hydrogen
of sulphuretted hydrogen and combines with it, and if thiosulphuric
acid contains the radicle of sulphuretted hydrogen (or hydrogen united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
with sulphur) of the same nature as in sulphuretted hydrogen, it is not
surprising that iodine reacts with sodium thiosulphate and forms sodium
tetrathionate. Thus, thiosulphuric acid, HS(SHO<sub>3</sub>), when deprived
of H, gives a radicle which immediately combines with another similar
radicle, forming the tetrathionate S<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>2</sub>HO)<sub>2</sub>. On this view<a name="FNanchor_67_345" id="FNanchor_67_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_345" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> of
the structure of the thionic acids and salts, it is also clear how all the
thionic acids, like thiosulphuric acid, easily give sulphur and sulphides,
with the exception only of dithionic acid, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, which, judging
from the above, stands apart from the series of the other thionic
acids. Dithionic acid stands in the same relation to sulphuric acid as
oxalic acid does to carbonic acid. Oxalic acid is dicarboxyl, (CHO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
= C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and so also dithionic acid is disulphoxyl, (SHO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = S<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.
Oxalic acid when ignited decomposes into carbonic anhydride and
carbonic oxide, CO, and dithionic acid when heated decomposes into
sulphuric anhydride and sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> stands
in the same relation to SO<sub>3</sub> as CO to CO<sub>2</sub>. This also explains the
peculiarity of the calcium, barium, and lead, &amp;c. salts of the thionic acids
being easily soluble (although the corresponding salts of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
and H<sub>2</sub>S dissolve with difficulty), because the former are similar to
the salts of the sulphonic acids, which are also soluble in water.
Thus the thionic acids are <i>disulphonic acids</i>, just as many dicarboxylic
acids are known&mdash;for example, CH<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_68_346" id="FNanchor_68_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_346" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>Sulphur exhibits an acid character, not only in its compounds with
hydrogen and oxygen, but also in those with other elements. The
compound of sulphur and carbon has been particularly well investigated.
It presents a great analogy to carbonic anhydride, both in its elementary
composition and chemical character. This substance is the so-called
carbon bisulphide, CS<sub>2</sub>, and corresponds with CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The first endeavours to obtain a compound of sulphur with carbon
were unsuccessful, for although sulphur does combine directly with
carbon, yet the formation of this compound requires distinctly
definite conditions. If sulphur be mixed with charcoal and heated, it
is simply driven off from the latter, and not the smallest trace of
carbon bisulphide is obtained. The formation of this compound
requires that the charcoal should be first heated to a red heat, but not
above, and then either the vapour of sulphur passed over it or lumps
of sulphur thrown on to the red-hot charcoal, but in small quantities,
so as not to lower the temperature of the latter. If the charcoal be
heated to a white heat, the amount of carbon bisulphide formed is less.
This depends, in the first place, on the carbon bisulphide dissociating
at a high temperature.<a name="FNanchor_69_347" id="FNanchor_69_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_347" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In the second place, Favre and Silberman
showed that in the combustion of one gram of carbon bisulphide (the
products will be CO<sub>2</sub> + 2SO<sub>2</sub>) 3,400 heat units are evolved&mdash;that is,
the combustion of a molecular quantity of carbon bisulphide evolves
258,400 heat units (according to Berthelot, 246,000). From a molecule
of carbon bisulphide in grams we may obtain 12 grams of carbon,
whose combustion evolves 96,000 heat units, and 64 grams of sulphur,
evolving by combustion (into SO<sub>2</sub>) 140,800 heat units. Hence we see
that the component elements separately evolve less heat by their combustion
(237,000 heat units) than carbon bisulphide itself&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
that heat should be evolved (at the ordinary temperature) and not
absorbed in its decomposition, and therefore that the formation of carbon
bisulphide from charcoal and sulphur is in all probability accompanied
by an absorption of heat.<a name="FNanchor_70_348" id="FNanchor_70_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_348" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> It is therefore not surprising that,
like other compounds produced with an absorption of heat (ozone,
nitrous oxide, hydrogen peroxide, &amp;c.), carbon bisulphide is unstable
and easily converted into the original substances from which it is
obtained. And indeed if the vapour of carbon bisulphide be passed
through a red-hot tube, it is decomposed&mdash;that is, it dissociates&mdash;into
sulphur and carbon. And this takes place at the temperature at which
this substance is formed, just as water decomposes into hydrogen and
oxygen at the temperature of its formation. In this absorption of heat
in the formation of carbon bisulphide is explained the facility with which
it suffers reactions of decomposition, which we shall see in the sequel,
and its main difference from the closely analogous carbonic anhydride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>In the laboratory carbon bisulphide is prepared as follows: A
porcelain tube is luted into a furnace in an inclined position, the upper
extremity of the tube being closed by a cork, and the lower end
connected with a condenser. The tube contains charcoal, which is
raised to a red heat, and then pieces of sulphur are placed in the upper
end. The sulphur melts, and its vapour comes into contact with the
red-hot charcoal, when combination takes place; the vapours condense
in the condenser, carbon bisulphide being a liquid boiling at
48°. On a large scale the apparatus depicted in fig. <a href="#fig_90">90</a> is employed.
A cast-iron cylinder rests on a stand in a furnace. Wood charcoal is
charged into the cylinder through the upper tube closed by a clay
stopper, whilst the sulphur is introduced through a tube reaching to
the bottom of the cylinder. Pieces of sulphur thrown into this tube
fall on to the bottom of the cylinder, and are converted into vapour,
which passes through the entire layer of charcoal in the cylinder. The
vapour of carbon bisulphide thus formed passes through the exit tube
first into a Woulfe's bottle (where the sulphur which has not entered
into the reaction is condensed), and then into a strongly-cooled condenser
or worm.<a name="FNanchor_71_349" id="FNanchor_71_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_349" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Pure carbon bisulphide is a colourless liquid, which refracts light
strongly, and has a pure ethereal smell; at 0° its specific gravity is 1·293,
and at 15° 1·271. If kept for a long time it seems to undergo a change,
especially when it is kept under water, in which it is insoluble. It
boils at 48°, and the tension of its vapour is so great that it evaporates
very easily, producing cold,<a name="FNanchor_72_350" id="FNanchor_72_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_350" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and therefore it has to be kept in well-stoppered
vessels; it is generally kept under a layer of water, which
hinders its evaporation and does not dissolve it.<a name="FNanchor_73_351" id="FNanchor_73_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_351" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>Carbon bisulphide enters into many combinations, which are frequently
closely analogous to the compounds of carbonic anhydride. In
this respect it is a <i>thio-anhydride</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it has the character of the acid
anhydrides,<a name="FNanchor_73_BIS_352" id="FNanchor_73_BIS_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_BIS_352" class="fnanchor">[73 bis]</a> like carbonic anhydride, with the difference that the
oxygen of the latter is replaced by sulphur. By thio-compounds in
general are understood those compounds of sulphur which differ from
the compounds of oxygen as carbon bisulphide does from carbonic
anhydride&mdash;that is, which correspond with the oxygen compounds, but
with substitution of sulphur for oxygen. Thus thiosulphuric acid is
monothiosulphuric acid&mdash;that is, sulphuric acid in which one atom
of sulphur replaces one atom of oxygen. With the sulphides of the
alkalis and alkaline earths, it forms saline substances corresponding
with the carbonates, and these compounds may be termed <i>thiocarbonates</i>.
For example, the composition of the sodium salt Na<sub>2</sub>CS<sub>3</sub> is
exactly like that of sodium carbonate. They are formed by the direct
solution of carbon bisulphide in aqueous solutions of the sulphides; but
they are difficult to obtain in a crystalline form, because they are easily
decomposable. When the solutions of these salts are highly concentrated
they begin to decompose, with the evolution of sulphuretted
hydrogen and the formation of a carbonate, water taking part in the
reaction&mdash;for example, K<sub>2</sub>CS<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>S.<a name="FNanchor_74_353" id="FNanchor_74_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_353" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>A remarkable example<a name="FNanchor_74_BIS_354" id="FNanchor_74_BIS_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_BIS_354" class="fnanchor">[74 bis]</a> of the thio-compounds is found in <i>thiocyanic
acid</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> cyanic acid in which the oxygen is replaced by
sulphur, HCNS. We know (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_379">IX.</a>) that with oxygen the
cyanides of the alkaline metals RCN give cyanates RCNO; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
also combine with sulphur, and therefore if yellow prussiate of potash
be treated as in the preparation of potassium cyanide, and sulphur be
added to the mass, potassium thiocyanate, KNCS, is obtained in
solution. This salt is much more stable than potassium cyanate; it
dissolves without change in water and alcohol, forming colourless
solutions from which it easily crystallises on evaporation. It may be
kept exposed to air even when in solution; in dissolving in water it
absorbs a considerable amount of heat, and forms a starting-point for
the preparation of all the thiocyanates, RCNS, and organic compounds
in which the metals are replaced by hydrocarbon groups. Such, for
example, is volatile mustard oil, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CSN (allyl thiocyanate),<a name="FNanchor_75_355" id="FNanchor_75_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_355" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> which
gives to mustard its caustic properties. With ferric salts the thiocyanates
give an exceedingly brilliant red coloration, which serves for detecting
the smallest traces of ferric salts in solution. Thiocyanic acid, HCNS,
may be obtained by a method of double decomposition, by distilling
potassium thiocyanate with dilute sulphuric acid. It is a volatile
colourless liquid, having a smell recalling that of vinegar, is soluble in
water, and may be kept in solution without change.<a name="FNanchor_75_BIS_356" id="FNanchor_75_BIS_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_BIS_356" class="fnanchor">[75 bis]</a></p>

<p>The sulphur compounds of chlorine Cl<sub>2</sub>S and Cl<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> may be regarded

hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>S and H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>; and on the other hand of the oxygen compounds
of chlorine, because chloride of sulphur, Cl<sub>2</sub>S, resembles chlorine
oxide, Cl<sub>2</sub>O, whilst Cl<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> corresponds with the higher oxide of chlorine;
or thirdly, we may see in these compounds the type of the acid chloranhydrides,

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 91.&mdash;Apparatus for the preparation of sulphur chloride, and similar volatile compounds
prepared by combustion in a stream of chlorine.</p></div>

<p>The compounds of sulphur with chlorine are prepared in the
apparatus depicted in fig. <a href="#fig_91">91</a>. As sulphur chloride is decomposed by
water, the chlorine evolved in the flask C must be dried before coming
into contact with the sulphur. It is therefore first passed through a
Woulfe's bottle, B, containing sulphuric acid, and then through the
cylinder D containing pumice stone moistened with sulphuric acid, and
then led into the retort E, in which the sulphur is heated. The compound
which is formed distils over into the receiver R. A certain
amount of sulphur passes over with the sulphur chloride, but if the
resultant distillate be re-saturated with chlorine and distilled no free
sulphur remains, the boiling-point rises to 144°, and pure sulphur
chloride, S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, is obtained. It has this formula because its vapour
density referred to hydrogen is 68. It is also obtained by heating
certain metallic chlorides (stannous, mercuric) with sulphur; both the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
metal and chlorine then combine with the sulphur. Sulphur chloride
is a yellowish-brown liquid, which boils at 144°, and has a specific gravity
of 1·70 at 0°. It fumes strongly in the air, reacting on the moisture
contained therein, and has a heavy chloranhydrous odour. It dissolves
sulphur, is miscible with carbon bisulphide, and falls to the bottom of a
vessel containing water, by which it is decomposed, forming sulphurous
anhydride and hydrochloric acid; but it first forms various lower
stages of oxidation of sulphur, because the addition of silver nitrate to
the solution gives a black precipitate. With hydrogen sulphide it gives
sulphur and hydrochloric acid, and it reacts directly with metals&mdash;especially
arsenic, antimony, and tin&mdash;forming sulphides and chlorides.
In the cold, it absorbs chlorine and gives <i>sulphur dichloride</i>, SCl<sub>2</sub>. The
entire conversion into this substance requires the prolonged passage of
dry chlorine through sulphur chloride surrounded by a freezing mixture.
The distillation of the dichloride must be conducted in a stream of
chlorine, as otherwise it partially decomposes into sulphur chloride and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
chlorine. Pure sulphur dichloride is a reddish-brown liquid, which
resembles the lower chloride in many respects; its specific gravity is
1·62; its odour is more suffocating than that of sulphur chloride; it
volatilises at 64°.<a name="FNanchor_77_358" id="FNanchor_77_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_358" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><i>Thionyl chloride</i>, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, may be regarded as oxidised sulphur
dichloride; it corresponds with sulphur chloride, S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, in which one
atom of sulphur is replaced by oxygen. At the same time it is chlorine
oxide (hypochlorous anhydride, Cl<sub>2</sub>O) combined with sulphur, and also
the chloranhydride of sulphurous acid&mdash;that is, SO(HO)<sub>2</sub>, in which the
two hydroxyl groups are replaced by two atoms of chlorine, or sulphurous
anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, in which one atom of oxygen is replaced by two
atoms of chlorine. All these representations are confirmed by reactions
of formation, or decompositions; they all agree with our notions of the
other compounds of sulphur, oxygen, and chlorine; hence these definitions
are not contradictory to each other. Thus, for instance, thionyl
chloride was first obtained by Schiff, by the action of dry sulphurous
anhydride on phosphorus pentachloride. On distilling the resultant
liquid, thionyl chloride comes over first at 80°, and on continuing
the distillation phosphorus oxychloride distils over at above 100°,
PCl<sub>5</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> = POCl<sub>3</sub> + SOCl<sub>2</sub>. This mode of preparation is direct evidence
of the oxychloride character of SOCl<sub>2</sub>. Würtz obtained the same
substance by passing a stream of chlorine oxide through a cold solution
of sulphur in sulphur chloride; the chlorine oxide then combined directly
with the sulphur, S + Cl<sub>2</sub>O = SOCl<sub>2</sub>, whilst the sulphur chloride remained
unchanged (sulphur cannot be combined directly with chlorine oxide, as
an explosion takes place). Thionyl chloride is a colourless liquid, with
a suffocating acrid smell; it has a specific gravity at 0° of 1·675, and boils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
at 78°. It sinks in water, by which it is immediately decomposed, like
all chloranhydrides&mdash;for example, like carbonyl chloride, which corresponds
with it: SOCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = SO<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl.<a name="FNanchor_77_BIS_359" id="FNanchor_77_BIS_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_BIS_359" class="fnanchor">[77 bis]</a></p>

<p>Normal <i>sulphuric acid has two corresponding chloranhydrides</i>; the
first, SO<sub>2</sub>(OH)Cl, is sulphuric acid, SO<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub>, in which one equivalent
of HO is replaced by chlorine; the second has the composition SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that
is, two HO groups are substituted by two of chlorine. The second
chloranhydride, or the compound SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, is called sulphuryl chloride,
and the first chloranhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>HOCl, may be called chlorosulphonic
acid, because it is really an acid; it still retains one hydroxyl of sulphuric
acid, and its corresponding salts are known. Thus, potassium
chloride absorbs the vapour of sulphuric anhydride, forming a salt,
SO<sub>3</sub>KCl, corresponding with SO<sub>3</sub>HCl as acid. In acting on sodium
chloride it forms hydrochloric acid and the salt NaSO<sub>3</sub>Cl. This first
chloranhydride of sulphuric acid, SO<sub>2</sub>HOCl, discovered by Williamson,
is obtained either by the action of phosphorus pentachloride on sulphuric
acid (PCl<sub>5</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = POCl<sub>3</sub> + HCl + HSO<sub>3</sub>Cl), or directly by the action
of dry hydrochloric acid on sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub> + HCl  = HSO<sub>3</sub>Cl.
The most easy and rapid method of its formation is by direct saturation
of cold Nordhausen acid with dry hydrochloric acid gas (SO<sub>3</sub> + HCl
= HSO<sub>3</sub>Cl), and distillation of the resultant solution; the distillate
then contains HSO<sub>3</sub>Cl. It is a colourless fuming liquid, having an acrid
odour; it boils at 153° (according to my determination, confirmed by
Konovaloff), and its specific gravity at 19° is 1·776. It is immediately
decomposed by water, forming hydrochloric and sulphuric acids, as
should be the case with a true chloranhydride. In the reactions of
this chloranhydride we find the easiest means of introducing the
sulphonic group HSO<sub>3</sub> into other compounds, because it is here combined
with chlorine. The second chloranhydride of sulphuric acid, or <i>sulphuryl
chloride</i>, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, was obtained by Regnault by the direct action of the
sun's ray on a mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and sulphurous
oxide. The gases gradually condense into a liquid, combining together
as carbonic oxide does with chlorine. It is also obtained when a mixture
of the two gases in acetic acid is allowed to stand for some time.
The first chloranhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>HCl, decomposes when heated at 200° in
a closed tube into sulphuric acid and sulphuryl chloride. It boils at
70°, its specific gravity is 1·7, it gives hydrochloric and sulphuric acids
with water, fumes in the air, and, judging by its vapour density, does
not decompose when distilled.<a name="FNanchor_78_360" id="FNanchor_78_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_360" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>In the group of the halogens we saw four closely analogous elements&mdash;fluorine,
chlorine, bromine, and iodine&mdash;and we meet with the same
number of closely allied analogues in the oxygen group; for besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a><br /><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
sulphur this group also includes <i>selenium</i> and <i>tellurium</i>: O, S, Se, Te.
These two groups are very closely allied, both in respect to the magnitudes
of their atomic weights and also in the faculty of the elements
of both groups for combining with metals. The distinct analogy and
definite degree of variance known to us for the halogens, also repeat
themselves in the same degree for the elements of the oxygen group.
Amongst the halogens fluorine has many peculiarities compared to
Cl, Br and I which are more closely analogous, whilst oxygen differs in
many respects from S, Se, Te, which possess greater similarities. The
analogy in a quantitative respect is perfect in both cases. Thus the
halogens combine with H, and the elements of the oxygen group with
H<sub>2</sub>, forming H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>Se, H<sub>2</sub>Te. The hydrogen compounds of
selenium and tellurium are acids like hydrogen sulphide. Selenium,
by simple heating in a stream of hydrogen, partially combines with it
directly, but seleniuretted hydrogen is more readily decomposable by
heat than sulphuretted hydrogen, and this property is still more
developed in telluretted hydrogen. Hydrogen selenide and telluride
are gases like sulphuretted hydrogen, and, like it, are soluble in water,
form saline compounds with alkalis, precipitate metallic salts, are
obtained by the action of acids on their compounds with metals, &amp;c.
Selenium and tellurium, like sulphur, give two normal grades of combination
with oxygen, both of an acid character, of which only the
forms corresponding to sulphurous anhydride&mdash;namely, selenious anhydride,
SeO<sub>2</sub>, and tellurous anhydride, TeO<sub>2</sub><a name="FNanchor_79_361" id="FNanchor_79_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_361" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>&mdash;are formed directly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
These are both solids, obtained by the combustion of the elements
themselves and by the action of oxidising agents on them. They form
feebly energetic acids, having distinct bibasic properties; however, a
characteristic difference from SO<sub>2</sub> is observable both in the physical
properties of these compounds and in their stability and capacity for
further oxidation, just as in the series of the halogens already known to
us, only in an inverse order; in the latter we saw that iodine combines
more easily than bromine or chlorine with oxygen, forming more stable
oxygen compounds, whereas here, on the contrary, sulphurous anhydride,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
as we know, is difficultly decomposed, parts with its sulphur with
difficulty, and is easily oxidised and especially in its salts, while
selenious and tellurous anhydrides are oxidised with difficulty and
easily reduced, even by means of sulphurous acid.</p>

<p><i>Selenium</i> was obtained in 1817 by Berzelius from the sublimate
which collects in the first chamber in the preparation of sulphuric
acid from Fahlun pyrites. Certain other pyrites also contain small
quantities of selenium. Some native selenides, especially those of lead,
mercury, and copper, have been found in the Hartz Mountains, but
only in small quantities. Pyrites and blendes, in which the sulphur
is partially replaced by selenium, still remain the chief source for its
extraction. When these pyrites are roasted they evolve selenious
anhydride, which condenses in the cooler portions of the apparatus in
which the pyrites are roasted, and is partially or wholly reduced by
the sulphurous anhydride simultaneously formed. The presence of
selenium in ores and sublimates is most simply tested by heating them
before the blowpipe, when they evolve the characteristic odour of garlic.
Selenium exhibits two modifications, like sulphur: one amorphous
and insoluble in carbon bisulphide, the other crystalline and slightly
soluble in carbon bisulphide (in 1,000 parts at 45° and 6,000 at 0°), and
separating from its solutions in monoclinic prisms. If the red precipitate
obtained by the action of sulphurous anhydride on selenious
anhydride be dried, it gives a brown powder, having a specific gravity
of 4·26, which when heated changes colour and fuses to a metallic
mass, which gains lustre as it cools. The selenium acquires different
properties according to the rate at which it is cooled from a fused
state; if rapidly cooled, it remains amorphous and has the same specific
gravity (4·28) as the powder, but if slowly cooled it becomes crystalline
and opaque, soluble in carbon bisulphide, and has a specific gravity
of 4·80. In this form it fuses at 214° and remains unchanged, whilst
the amorphous form, especially above 80°, gradually passes into the
crystalline variety. The transition is accompanied by the evolution
of heat, as in the case of sulphur; thus the analogy between sulphur
and selenium is clearly shown here. In the fused amorphous form
selenium presents a brown mass, slightly translucent, with a vitreous
fracture, whilst in the crystalline form it has the appearance of a grey
metal, with a feeble lustre and a crystalline fracture.<a name="FNanchor_79_BIS_362" id="FNanchor_79_BIS_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_BIS_362" class="fnanchor">[79 bis]</a> Selenium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
boils at 700°, forming a vapour whose density is only constant at a temperature
of about 1,400°, when it is equal to 79·4 (referred to hydrogen)&mdash;that

<p><i>Tellurium</i> is met with still more rarely than selenium (it is known
in Saxony) in combination with gold, silver, lead, and antimony in
the so-called foliated tellurium ore. Bismuth telluride and silver
telluride have been found in Hungary and in the Altai. Tellurium is
extracted from bismuth telluride by mixing the finely-powdered ore
with potassium and charcoal in as intimate a mixture as possible,
and then heating in a covered crucible. Potassium telluride, K<sub>2</sub>Te,
is then formed, because the charcoal reduces potassium tellurite.
As potassium telluride is soluble in water, forming a red-brown
solution which is decomposed by the oxygen of the atmosphere
(K<sub>2</sub>Te + O + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2KHO + Te), the mass formed in the crucible is
treated with boiling water and filtered as rapidly as possible, and the
resultant solution exposed to the air, by which means the tellurium
is precipitated.<a name="FNanchor_80_363" id="FNanchor_80_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_363" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> In a free state tellurium has a perfectly <i>metallic
appearance</i>; it is of a silver-white colour, crystallises very easily in
long brilliant needles; is very brittle, so that it can be easily reduced
to powder; but it is a bad conductor of heat and electricity, and
in this respect, as in many others, it forms a transition from the metals
to the non-metals. Its specific gravity is 6·18, it melts at an incipient
red heat, and takes fire when heated in air, like selenium and sulphur,
burning with a blue flame, evolving white fumes of tellurous anhydride,
TeO<sub>2</sub>, and emitting an acrid smell if no selenium be present;
but if it be, the odour of the latter preponderates. Alkalis dissolve
tellurium when boiled with it, potassium telluride, K<sub>2</sub>Te, and potassium
tellurite, K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>, being formed. The solution is of a red colour, owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
to the presence of the telluride, K<sub>2</sub>Te; but the colour disappears when
the solution is cooled or diluted, the tellurium being all precipitated:
2K<sub>2</sub>Te + K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 6KHO + 3Te.<a name="FNanchor_81_364" id="FNanchor_81_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_364" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_265" id="Footnote_1_265"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_265"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The character of sulphur is very clearly defined in the organo-metallic compounds.
Not to dwell on this vast subject, which belongs to the province of organic
chemistry, I think it will be sufficient for our purpose to compare the physical properties
of the ethyl compounds of mercury, zinc, sulphur and oxygen. The composition of all of
them is expressed by the general formula (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>R, where R = Hg, Zn, S, or O. They
are all volatile: mercury ethyl, Hg(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, boils at 159°, its sp. gr. is 2·444, molecular
volume = 106; zinc ethyl boils at 118°, sp. gr. 1·882, volume 101; ethyl sulphide,
S(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, boils at 90°, sp. gr. 0·825, volume 107; common ether, or ethyl oxide, O(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
boils at 35°, sp. gr. 0·736, volume 101, in addition to which diethyl itself, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>,
boils about 0°, sp. gr. about 0·62, volume about 94. Thus the substitution of Hg, S, and
O scarcely changes the volume, notwithstanding the difference of the weights; the
physical influence, if one may so express oneself, of these elements, which are so very
different in their atomic weights, is almost alike.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_266" id="Footnote_2_266"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_266"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Therefore in former times sulphur was known as an amphid element. Although the
analogy between the compounds of sulphur and oxygen has been recognised from the
very birth of modern chemistry (owing, amongst other things, to the fact that the oxides
and sulphides are the most widely spread metallic ores in nature), still it has only been
clearly expressed by the periodic system, which places both these elements in group VI.
Here, moreover, stands out that parallelism which exists between SO<sub>2</sub> and ozone OO<sub>2</sub>,
between K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> and peroxide of potassium K<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Volkovitch in 1893 again drew attention
to this parallelism).</p></div>

In the same neighbourhood there are naphtha springs and mud volcanoes. It may be
that these substances have reduced the sulphur from gypsum.</p>

<p>The chief proof in favour of the origin of sulphur from gypsum is that in treating the
deposits for the extraction of the sulphur it is found that the proportion of sulphur
to calcium carbonate never exceeds that which it would be had they both been derived
from calcium sulphate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_268" id="Footnote_4_268"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_268"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Naturally only those ores of sulphur which contain a considerable amount of sulphur
can be treated by this method. With poor ores it is necessary to have recourse to distillation
or mechanical treatment in order to separate the sulphur, but its price is so low
that this method in most cases is not profitable.</p>

<p>The sulphur obtained by the above-described method still contains some impurities,
but it is frequently made use of in this form for many purposes, and especially in considerable
quantities for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, and for strewing over grapes.
For other purposes, and especially in the preparation of gunpowder, a purer sulphur is
required. Sulphur may be purified by distillation. The crude sulphur is called <i>rough</i>,
and the distilled sulphur <i>refined</i>. The arrangement given in fig. <a href="#fig_86">86</a> is employed for
refining sulphur. The rough sulphur is melted in the boiler <i>d</i>, and as it melts it is run
through the tube F into an iron retort B heated by the naked flame of the furnace.
Here the sulphur is converted into vapour, which passes through a wide tube into the
chamber G, surrounded by stone walls and furnished with a safety-valve S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_269" id="Footnote_5_269"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_269"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Flowers of sulphur always contain a certain amount of the oxides of sulphur.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_270" id="Footnote_6_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_270"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Sulphur may be extracted by various other means. It may be extracted from iron
pyrites, FeS<sub>2</sub>, which is very widely distributed in nature. From 100 parts of iron pyrites
about half the sulphur contained, namely, about 25 parts, may be extracted by heating
without the access of air, a lower sulphide of iron, which is more stable under the action
of heat, being left behind. Alkali waste (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_513">XII.</a>), containing calcium sulphide and
gypsum, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, may be used for the same purpose, but native sulphur is so cheap that
recourse can only be had to these sources when the calcium sulphide appears as a worthless
by-product. The most simple process for the extraction of sulphur from alkali
waste, in a chemical sense, consists in evolving sulphuretted hydrogen from the calcium
sulphide by the action of hydrochloric acid. The sulphuretted hydrogen when burnt
gives water and sulphurous anhydride, which reacts on fresh sulphuretted hydrogen
with the separation of sulphur. The combustion of the sulphuretted hydrogen may be
so conducted that a mixture of 2H<sub>2</sub>S and SO<sub>2</sub> is straightway formed, and this mixture
will deposit sulphur (Chapter XII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_14_733">14</a>). Gossage and Chance treat alkali waste
with carbonic anhydride, and subject the sulphuretted hydrogen evolved to incomplete
combustion (this is best done by passing a mixture of sulphuretted hydrogen and air,
taken in the requisite proportions, over red-hot ferric oxide), by which means water and
the vapour of sulphur are formed: H<sub>2</sub>S + O = H<sub>2</sub>O + S.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_271" id="Footnote_7_271"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_271"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> One hundred parts of liquid carbon bisulphide, CS<sub>2</sub>, dissolve 16·5 parts of sulphur
at -11°, 24 parts at 0°, 37 parts at 15°, 46 parts at 22°, and 181 parts at 55°. The
saturated solution boils at 55°, whilst pure carbon bisulphide boils at 47°. The solution
of sulphur in carbon bisulphide reduces the temperature, just as in the solution of salts
in water. Thus the solution of 20 parts of sulphur in 50 parts of carbon bisulphide at
22° lowers the temperature by 5°; 100 parts of benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, dissolves 0·965 part of
sulphur at 26°, and 4·377 parts at 71°; chloroform, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, dissolves 1·2 part of sulphur
at 22°, and 16·35 parts at 174°.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_272" id="Footnote_8_272"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_272"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> If the experiment be made in a vessel with a narrow capillary tube, the sulphur
fuses at a lower temperature (occurs, as it were, in a supersaturated state), and solidifying
at 90°, appears in a rhombic form (Schützenberger).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_273" id="Footnote_9_273"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_273"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> If sulphur be cautiously melted in a U tube immersed in a salt bath, and then
gradually cooled, it is possible for all the sulphur to remain liquid at 100°. It will now
be in a state of superfusion; thus also by careful refrigeration water may be obtained in
a liquid state at -10°, and a lump of ice then causes such water to form ice, and
the temperature rises to 0°. If a prismatic crystal of sulphur be thrown into one branch
of the U tube containing the liquid sulphur at 100°, and an octahedral crystal be thrown
into the other branch, then, as Gernez showed, the sulphur in each branch will crystallise
in the corresponding form, and both forms are obtained at the same temperature;
therefore it is not the influence of temperature only which causes the molecules of
sulphur to distribute themselves in one or another form, but also the influence of the
crystalline parts already formed. This phenomenon is essentially analogous to the
phenomena of supersaturated solutions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_274" id="Footnote_10_274"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_274"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> A certain amount of insoluble sulphur remains for a long time in the mass of soft
sulphur, changing into the ordinary variety. Freshly-cooled soft sulphur contains about
one-third of insoluble sulphur, and after the lapse of two years it still contains about
15 p.c. Flowers of sulphur, obtained by the rapid condensation of sulphur from a state
of vapour, also contains a certain amount of insoluble sulphur. <i>Rapidly distilled and
condensed sulphur</i> also contains some insoluble sulphur. Hence a certain amount of
insoluble sulphur is frequently found in roll sulphur. The action of light on a solution
of sulphur converts a certain portion into the insoluble modification. Insoluble sulphur
is of a lighter colour than the ordinary variety. It is best prepared by vaporising sulphur
in a stream of carbonic anhydride, hydrochloric acid, &amp;c., and collecting the vapour in
cold water. When condensed in this manner it is nearly all insoluble in carbon bisulphide.
It then has the form of hollow spheroids, and is therefore lighter than the
common variety: sp. gr. 1·82. An idea of the modifications taking place in sulphur
between 110° and 250° may be formed from the fact that at 150° liquid sulphur has a
coefficient of expansion of about 0·0005, whilst between 150° and 250° it is less than
0·0003.</p>

<p>Engel (1891), by decomposing a saturated solution of hyposulphite of sodium (Note <a href="#Footnote_42_313">29</a>)
with HCl in the cold (the sulphur is not precipitated directly in this case), obtained, after
shaking up with chloroform and evaporation, crystals of sulphur (sp. gr. 2·135), which, after
several hours, passed into the insoluble (in CS<sub>2</sub>) state, and in so doing became opaque,
and increased in volume. But if a mixture of solution of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and HCl be allowed to
stand, it deposits sulphur, which, after sufficient washing, is able to dissolve in water
(like the colloid varieties of the metallic sulphides, alumina, boron, and silver), but this
colloid <i>solution of sulphur</i> soon deposits sulphur insoluble in CS<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>When a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen in water is decomposed by an electric
current the sulphur is deposited on the positive pole, and has therefore an electro-negative
character, and this sulphur is soluble in carbon bisulphide. When a solution
of sulphurous acid is decomposed in the same manner, the sulphur is deposited on the
negative pole, and is therefore electro-positive, and the sulphur so deposited is insoluble
in carbon bisulphide. The sulphur which is combined with metals must have the properties
of the sulphur contained in sulphuretted hydrogen, whilst the sulphur combined
with chlorine is like that which is combined with oxygen in sulphurous anhydride.
Hence Berthelot recognises the presence of soluble sulphur in metallic sulphides, and of
the insoluble modification of amorphous sulphur in sulphur chloride. Cloez showed that
the sulphur precipitated from solutions is either soluble or insoluble, according to
whether it separates from an alkaline or acid solution. If sulphur be melted with
a small quantity of iodine or bromine, then on pouring out the molten mass it forms
amorphous sulphur, which keeps so for a very long time, and is insoluble, or nearly so, in
carbon bisulphide. This is taken advantage of in casting certain articles in sulphur,
which by this means retain their tenacity for a long time; for example, the discs of
electrical machines.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_275" id="Footnote_11_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_275"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Here, however, it is very important to remark that both benzene and acetylene
can exist at the ordinary temperature, whilst the sulphur molecule S<sub>2</sub> only exists at high
temperatures; and if this sulphur be allowed to cool, it passes first into S<sub>6</sub> and then into
a liquid state. Were it possible to have sulphur at the ordinary temperature in both the
above modifications, then in all probability the sulphur in the state S<sub>2</sub> would present
totally different properties from those which it has in the form S<sub>6</sub>, just as the properties
of gaseous acetylene are far from being similar to those of liquid benzene. Sulphur, in
the form of S<sub>2</sub>, is probably a substance which boils at a much lower temperature than
the variety with which we are now dealing. Paterno and Nasini (1888), following the
method of depression or fall of the freezing-point in a benzene solution, found that the
molecule of sulphur in solution contains S<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>One must here call attention to the fact that sulphur, with all its analogy to
oxygen (which also shows itself in its faculty to give the modification S<sub>2</sub>), is also able
to give a series of compounds containing more atoms of sulphur than the analogous oxygen
compounds do of oxygen. Thus, for instance, compounds of 5 atoms of sulphur with
1 atom of barium, BaS<sub>5</sub>, are known, whereas with oxygen only BaO<sub>2</sub> is known. On every
side one cannot but see in sulphur a faculty for the union of a greater number of atoms
than with oxygen. With oxygen the form of ozone, O<sub>3</sub>, is very unstable, the stable form
is O<sub>2</sub>; whilst with sulphur S<sub>6</sub> is the stable form, and S<sub>2</sub> is exceedingly unstable. Furthermore,
it is remarkable that sulphur gives a higher degree of oxidation, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, corresponding,
as it were, with its complex composition, if we suppose that in S<sub>6</sub> four atoms of sulphur
are replaced by oxygen and one by two atoms of hydrogen. The formulæ of its compounds,
K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, BaS<sub>5</sub>, and many others, have no analogues among the compounds
of oxygen. They all correspond with the form S<sub>6</sub> (one portion of the sulphur being
replaced by oxygen and another by metals), which is not attained by oxygen. In this
faculty of sulphur to hold many atoms of other substances the same forces appear which
cause many atoms of sulphur to form one complex molecule.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_276" id="Footnote_12_276"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_276"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> In the formation of potassium sulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S (that is, in the combination of 32
parts of sulphur with 78 parts of potassium), about 100 thousand heat units are developed.
Nearly as much heat is developed in the combination of an equivalent quantity
of sodium; about 90 thousand heat units in the formation of calcium or strontium sulphide;
about 40 thousand for zinc or cadmium sulphide, and about 20 thousand for iron,
cobalt, or nickel sulphide. Less heat is evolved in the combination of sulphur with
copper, lead, and silver. According to Thomsen, sulphur develops heat with hydrogen
in solutions. The reaction I<sub>2</sub>,Aq,H<sub>2</sub>S = 21,830 calories. But, as the reaction I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + Aq
develops 26,842 calories, it follows that the reaction H<sub>2</sub> + S develops 4,512 calories.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_277" id="Footnote_13_277"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_277"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> If sulphur be melted in a flask and heated nearly to its boiling point, as
Lidoff showed, the addition, drop by drop (from a funnel with a stopcock) of heavy (0·9)
naphtha oil (of lubricating oleonaphtha), &amp;c., is followed by a regular evolution of sulphuretted
hydrogen. This is analogous to the action of bromine or iodine on paraffin
and other oils, because hydrobromic or hydriodic acid is then formed (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_459">XI.</a>)
A certain amount of hydrogen sulphide is even formed when sulphur is boiled with water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_278" id="Footnote_14_278"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_278"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> However, the matter is really much more complicated. Thus zinc sulphide evolves
sulphuretted hydrogen with sulphuric or hydrochloric acids, but does not react with
acetic acid and is oxidised by nitric acid. Ferrous sulphide evolves sulphuretted hydrogen
with acids, whilst the bisulphide, FeS<sub>2</sub>, does not react with acids of ordinary strength.
This absence of action depends, among other things, on the form in which the native
iron pyrites occurs; it is a crystalline, compact, and very dense substance; and acids in
general react with great difficulty on such metallic sulphides. This is seen very clearly
in the case of zinc sulphide; if this substance is obtained by double decomposition, it
separates as a white precipitate, which evolves sulphuretted hydrogen with great ease
when treated with acids. Zinc sulphide is obtained in the same form when zinc is fused
with sulphur, but native zinc sulphide&mdash;which occurs in compact masses of zinc blende,
and has a metallic lustre&mdash;is not decomposed or scarcely decomposed by sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Another source of complication in the behaviour of the metallic sulphides towards
acids depends on the action of water, and is shown in the fact that the action varies
with different degrees of dilution or proportion of water present. The best known
example of this is antimonious sulphide, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, for strong hydrochloric acid, containing
not more water than corresponds with HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O, even decomposes native antimony
glance, with evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen, whilst dilute acid has no action,
and in the presence of an excess of water the reaction 2SbCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>S = Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> + 6HCl
occurs, whilst in the presence of a small amount of water the reaction proceeds in
exactly the opposite direction. Here the participation of water in the reaction and its
affinity are evident.</p>

<p>The facts that lead sulphide is insoluble in acids, that zinc sulphide is soluble in
hydrochloric acid but insoluble in acetic acid, that calcium sulphide is even decomposed
by carbonic acid, &amp;c.&mdash;all these peculiarities of the sulphides are in correlation with the
amount of heat evolved in the reaction of the oxides with hydrogen sulphide and with
acids, as is seen from the observations of Favre and Silberman, and from the comparisons
made by Berthelot in the Proceedings of the Paris Academy of Sciences, 1870, to which
we refer the reader for further details.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_279" id="Footnote_15_279"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_279"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> <i>Ferrous sulphide</i> is formed by heating a piece of iron to an incipient white heat,
and then removing it from the furnace and bringing it into contact with a piece of
sulphur. Combination then proceeds, accompanied by the development of heat, and the
ferrous sulphide formed fuses. The sulphide of iron thus formed is a black, easily-fusible
substance, insoluble in water. When damp it attracts oxygen from the air, and
is converted into green vitriol, FeSO<sub>4</sub>. If all the iron does not combine with the sulphur
in the method described above, the action of sulphuric acid will evolve hydrogen as well
as hydrogen sulphide.</p>

<p>We will not describe the details of the preparation of sulphuretted hydrogen
employed as a reagent in the laboratory, because, in the first place, the methods are
essentially the same as in the preparation of hydrogen, and, in the second place, because
the apparatus and methods employed are always described in text-books of analytical
chemistry. Ferrous sulphide may be advantageously replaced by calcium sulphide or a
mixture of calcium and magnesium sulphides. A solution of magnesium hydrosulphide,
MgS,H<sub>2</sub>S, is very convenient, as at 60° it evolves a stream of pure hydrogen sulphide. A
paste, consisting of CuS with crystals of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and water, may also be employed, since
it only evolves H<sub>2</sub>S when heated (Habermann).</p></div>

hydrogen polysulphide, which we shall presently describe, by the action of heat, and in
the presence of a small amount of water. If poured into a bent tube, like that described
for the liquefaction of ammonia (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_246">VI.</a>), the hydrogen polysulphide is decomposed
by heat, in the presence of water, into sulphur and sulphuretted hydrogen, which condenses
in the cold end of the tube into a colourless liquid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_281" id="Footnote_16_281"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_281"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Sulphuretted hydrogen is still more soluble in alcohol than in water; one volume
at the ordinary temperature dissolves as much as eight volumes of the gas. The solutions
in water and alcohol undergo change, especially in open vessels, owing to the fact
that the water and alcohol dissolve oxygen from the atmosphere, which, acting on the
sulphuretted hydrogen, forms water and sulphur. The solution may be so altered in
this manner that every trace of sulphuretted hydrogen disappears. Solutions of sulphuretted
hydrogen in glycerine change much more slowly, and may therefore be kept for
a long time as reagents. De Forcrand obtained a hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>S,16H<sub>2</sub>O, resembling the
hydrates given by many gases.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_282" id="Footnote_17_282"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_282"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Some metals evolve hydrogen from sulphuretted hydrogen at the ordinary temperature.
For example, the light metals, and copper and silver (especially with the
access of air?) among the heavy metals. Hence articles made of silver turn black in the
presence of vapours containing sulphuretted hydrogen, because silver sulphide is black.
Zinc and cadmium act at a red heat, but not completely.</p></div>

lighted, and be transformed into sulphurous anhydride and water. But if it burns in a
limited supply of air&mdash;for instance, when a cylinder is filled with it and lighted&mdash;then only
the hydrogen burns, which has, judging from the amount of heat developed in its combustion
and from all its properties, a greater affinity for oxygen than sulphur. In this

as intimately as possible with powdered sulphur and heated in an atmosphere of carbonic
anhydride. The higher compounds are decomposed by water. By increasing the proportion
of sulphur, the following compounds have been obtained: P<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub> as prisms (fuses
at 165°, Rebs), soluble in carbon bisulphide, and unaltered by air and water; <i>phosphorus
trisulphide</i>, P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, is the analogue of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; it is a light yellow crystalline compound
only slightly soluble in carbon bisulphide, fusible and volatile, decomposed into hydrogen
sulphide and phosphorous acid by water, and, like the highest compound of
sulphur and phosphorus, P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, it forms thio-salts with potassium sulphide, &amp;c. This
<i>phosphorus pentasulphide</i> corresponds with phosphoric anhydride; like the trisulphide it
gives hydrogen sulphide and phosphoric acid with an excess of water. It reacts in many
respects like phosphoric chloride. The sulphide PS<sub>2</sub> is also known; the vapour density
of this compound seems to indicate a molecule P<sub>3</sub>S<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p><i>Phosphorus sulphochloride</i>, PSCl<sub>3</sub>, corresponds with phosphorus oxychloride. It is
a colourless, pleasant-smelling liquid, boiling at 124°, and of sp. gr. 1·63; it fumes in air
and is decomposed by water: PSCl<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S + 3HCl. It is obtained
when phosphoric chloride is treated with hydrogen sulphide, hydrochloric acid being also
formed; it is also produced by the action of phosphoric chloride on certain sulphides&mdash;for
example, on antimonious sulphide, also by the (cautious) action of phosphorus on sulphur
chloride: 2P + 3S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> = 2PSCl<sub>3</sub> + 4S, by the action of PCl<sub>5</sub> upon certain sulphides, for
example, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, by the reaction: 3MCl + P<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> = PSCl<sub>3</sub> + M<sub>3</sub>PS<sub>4</sub> (Glatzel, 1893), and in the
reaction 3PCl<sub>3</sub> + SOCl<sub>2</sub> = PCl<sub>5</sub> + POCl<sub>3</sub> + PSCl<sub>3</sub>, showing the reducing action of phosphorus
trichloride, which is especially clear in the reaction SO<sub>3</sub> + PCl<sub>3</sub> = SO<sub>2</sub> + POCl<sub>3</sub>.
Thorpe and Rodger (1889), by heating 3PbF<sub>2</sub> or BiF<sub>3</sub> with phosphorus pentasulphide
(and also by heating AsF<sub>3</sub> and PSCl<sub>3</sub> to 150°), obtained thiophosphoryl fluoride as a
colourless, spontaneously inflammable gas (see further on, Note <a href="#Footnote_74_BIS_354">74 bis</a>, and Chapter XIX.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_25_232">25</a>). The action of PSCl<sub>3</sub> upon NaHO gives a salt of monothiophosphoric acid
(Würtz, Kubierschky), H<sub>3</sub>PSO<sub>3</sub>, which gives soluble salts of the alkalis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_287" id="Footnote_21_287"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_287"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Sulphuretted hydrogen does not saturate the alkaline properties of alkali
hydroxides, so that a solution of potassium hydroxide will not under any circumstances
give a neutral liquid with sulphuretted hydrogen. In this case the sulphuretted
hydrogen forms in solution only an acid salt with the potassium: KHO + H<sub>2</sub>S
= KHS + H<sub>2</sub>O. It must be supposed that the normal salt is not formed in the solution&mdash;that
is, that the reaction 2KHO + H<sub>2</sub>S = K<sub>2</sub>S + 2H<sub>2</sub>O does not take place. This is
seen from the fact that a development of heat, depending on the formation of potassium
hydrosulphide, KHS, is remarked when as much hydrogen sulphide is passed into a
solution of potassium hydroxide as it will absorb. But if a further quantity of potassium
hydroxide be added to the resultant solution, heat is not developed, whilst if alkali be
added to potassium acid sulphate or sodium acid carbonate, heat is developed. It must
not be concluded from this that H<sub>2</sub>S is a monobasic acid, for here there is a question of the
decomposing action of water upon K<sub>2</sub>S; K<sub>2</sub>S and H<sub>2</sub>O in reacting on each other should
absorb heat if the reaction of KHS upon KHO evolves heat. Furthermore, it must be
taken into account that potassium oxide, K<sub>2</sub>O, and the anhydrous oxides like it, also do
not exist in solutions, for whenever they are formed they immediately react with the
water, forming caustic potash, KHO, &amp;c. In the same way, directly potassium sulphide,
K<sub>2</sub>S, is formed in water it is decomposed into potassium hydroxide and hydrosulphide:
K<sub>2</sub>S + H<sub>2</sub>O = KHO + KHS. Potassium sulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S, in a solid state corresponds with
K<sub>2</sub>O, although neither can exist in solution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_288" id="Footnote_22_288"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_288"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> During recent years (beginning with Schulze, 1882) it has been found that many
metallic sulphides which were considered totally insoluble do, under certain circumstances,
form very unstable solutions in water, as already mentioned in Chapter I.,
Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_57_104">57</a>57. Arsenic sulphide is very easily obtained in the form of a solution (hydrosol).
Solutions of copper and cadmium sulphides may also be easily obtained by precipitating
their salts CuX<sub>2</sub>, or CdX<sub>2</sub>, with ammonium sulphide, and washing the precipitate; but
they are re-precipitated by the addition of foreign salts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_289" id="Footnote_23_289"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_289"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> In reality the preceding reaction should be expressed thus: FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 2KHS
= FeS + 2KCl + H<sub>2</sub>S (Note <a href="#Footnote_21_287">21</a>), because in the presence of water not K<sub>2</sub>S but KHS
reacts. But as the sulphuretted hydrogen takes no part in the reaction, it is usual to
express the formation of such sulphides without taking the hydrogen sulphide proceeding
from the potassium or ammonium hydrosulphides into account. It is not usual to employ
potassium sulphide but ammonium sulphide&mdash;or, to speak more accurately, ammonium
hydrosulphide&mdash;in order to avoid the formation of a non-volatile salt of potassium and to
have, together with the formation of the sulphide, a salt of ammonium which can always
be driven off by evaporating the solution and igniting the residue&mdash;for instance:
FeCl<sub>2</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S = FeS + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Thus the metallic sulphides may be divided into
three chief classes: (1) <i>those soluble in water</i>, (2) <i>those insoluble in water but reacting
with acids</i>, and (3) <i>those insoluble both in water and acids</i>. The third class may be
easily subdivided into two groups; to the first group belong those sulphides which
correspond with bases or basic oxides, and are therefore unable to play the part of an
acid with the sulphides of the alkalis, and are insoluble in NH<sub>4</sub>HS, whilst the sulphides
of the second group are of an acid character, and give soluble thio-salts with the
sulphides of the alkaline metals, in which they play the part of an acid. To this group
belong those metals whose corresponding oxides have acid properties. It must be
observed, however, that not all metallic acids have corresponding sulphides, partly
owing to the fact that certain acids are reducible by sulphuretted hydrogen, especially
when their lower degrees of oxidation are of a basic character. Such are, for instance,
the acids of chromium, manganese, &amp;c. Sulphuretted hydrogen converts them into
lower oxides, having the properties of bases. Those bases which do not combine with
feeble acids, such as carbonic acid and hydrogen sulphide, give a precipitate of hydroxide
with ammonium sulphide&mdash;for example, aluminium salts react in this manner. This
difference of the metals in their behaviour towards sulphuretted hydrogen gives a very
valuable means of separating them from each other, and <i>is taken advantage of in
analytical chemistry</i>. If, for instance, the metals of the first and third groups occur
together, it is only necessary to convert them into soluble salts, and to act on the
solution of the salts with sulphuretted hydrogen; this will precipitate the metals of the
third group in the form of sulphides, whilst the metals of the first group will not be in
the least acted on. Such a method of separating the metals is considered more fully in
analytical chemistry, and we will therefore limit ourselves here to pointing out to which
groups the most common metals belong, and the colour which is proper to the sulphide
precipitated.</p>

<p>The metals of the alkalis and of the alkaline earths are not precipitated either by
sulphuretted hydrogen or ammonium sulphide. The metals of the alkaline earths when
in acid solutions in the form of phosphates and many other salts are precipitated by
ammonium sulphide, because the latter neutralises the free acid, with formation of an
ammonium salt of the acid and evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_290" id="Footnote_24_290"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_290"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> Rebs took di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentasulphides of sodium, potassium, and barium,
which he prepared by dissolving sulphur in solutions of the normal sulphides; on adding
hydrochloric acid he always obtained hydrogen pentasulphide, whence it is evident that
4H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub> = (<i>n</i> - 1)H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> + (5 - <i>n</i>)H<sub>2</sub>S. For example, if H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> were formed, it would decompose
according to the equation 4H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>S. The hydrogen pentasulphide formed
breaks up into hydrogen sulphide and sulphur when brought into contact with water.
Previous to Rebs' researches many chemists stated that all polysulphides gave the
bisulphide H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, and Hofmann recognised only hydrogen trisulphide, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_291" id="Footnote_25_291"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_291"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The formation of the polysulphides of hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub> is easily understood from
the law of substitution, like that of the saturated hydrocarbons, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n + 2</sub>, knowing that
sulphur gives H<sub>2</sub>S, because the molecule of sulphuretted hydrogen may be divided into H
and HS. This radicle, HS, is equivalent to H. By substituting this radicle for hydrogen
in H<sub>2</sub>S we obtain (HS)HS = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, (HS)(HS)S = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., in general H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub>. The homologues
of CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n + 2</sub> are formed in this manner from CH<sub>4</sub>, and consequently the polysulphides
H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub> are the homologues of H<sub>2</sub>S. The question arises why in H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>n</sub> the apparent
limit of <i>n</i> is 5&mdash;that is, why does the substitution end with the formation of H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>? The
answer appears to me to be clearly because in the molecule of sulphur, S<sub>6</sub>, there are six
atoms of sulphur (Note <a href="#Footnote_11_275">11</a>). The forces in one and the other case are the same. In the
one case they hold S<sub>6</sub> together, in the other S<sub>5</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>; and, judging from H<sub>2</sub>S, the two
atoms of hydrogen are equal in power and significance to the atom of sulphur. Just as
hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, expresses the composition of ozone, O<sub>3</sub>, in which O is replaced
by H<sub>2</sub>, so also H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> corresponds with S<sub>6</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_292" id="Footnote_26_292"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_292"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> <i>Ammonium sulphide</i>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S, may be prepared by passing sulphuretted hydrogen
into a vessel full of dry ammonia, or by passing both dry gases together into a very cold
receiver. In the latter case it is necessary to prevent the access of air, and to have an
excess of ammonia. Under these circumstances, two volumes of ammonia combine with
one volume of sulphuretted hydrogen, and form a colourless, very volatile, crystalline
substance, having a very unpleasant odour, which is very poisonous and exceedingly
unstable. When exposed to the air it absorbs oxygen and acquires a yellow colour, and
then contains oxygen and polysulphide compounds (because a portion of the hydrogen
sulphide gives water and sulphur). It is soluble in water and forms a colourless solution,
which, however, in all probability contains free ammonia and the acid salt&mdash;that is,
ammonium hydrosulphide, NH<sub>4</sub>HS, or (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,S,H<sub>2</sub>S. This salt is formed when dry
ammonia is mixed with an excess of dry sulphuretted hydrogen. The compound contains
equal volumes of the components NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S = (NH<sub>4</sub>)HS. It crystallises in an
anhydrous state in colourless plates, and may be easily volatilised (dissociating like
ammonium chloride), even at the ordinary temperature; it has an alkaline reaction,
absorbs oxygen from the air, is soluble in water, and its solution is usually prepared by
saturating an aqueous solution of ammonia with sulphuretted hydrogen. According to
the ordinary rule, these salts, like other ammonium salts, split up into ammonia and
sulphuretted hydrogen when they are distilled.</p>

<p>A solution of ammonium sulphide is able to dissolve sulphur, and it then contains
compounds of hydrogen polysulphide and ammonia. Some of these compounds may be
obtained in a crystalline form. Thus Fritzsche obtained a compound of ammonia with
hydrogen pentasulphide, or ammonium pentasulphide, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, in the following manner:
He saturated an aqueous solution of ammonia with sulphuretted hydrogen, added
powdered sulphur to it, and passed ammonia gas into the solution, which then
absorbed a fresh amount. After this he again passed sulphuretted hydrogen into the
solution, and then added sulphur, and then again ammonia. After repeating this several
times, orange-yellow crystals of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> separated out from the liquid. These crystals
melted at 40° to 50°, and were very unstable.</p>

<p>When a solution of ammonium hydrosulphide, prepared by saturating a solution of
ammonia with sulphuretted hydrogen, is exposed to the air, it turns yellow, owing to the
presence of an ammonium polysulphide, whose formation is due to the sulphuretted
hydrogen being oxidised by the air and converted into water and sulphur, which is dissolved
by the ammonium sulphide. In certain analytical reactions it is usual to employ
a solution of ammonium sulphide which has been kept for some time and acquired a
yellow colour. This yellow sulphide of ammonium deposits sulphur when saturated with
acids, whilst a freshly-prepared solution only evolves sulphuretted hydrogen. The yellow
solution furthermore contains ammonium thiosulphate, which is derived not only from
the oxidation of the ammonium sulphide, but also from the action of the liberated sulphur
on the ammonia, just as an alkaline salt of thiosulphuric acid and a sulphide are formed
by the action of sulphur on a solution of a caustic alkali.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_293" id="Footnote_27_293"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_293"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> <i>Potassium sulphide</i>, K<sub>2</sub>S, is obtained by heating a mixture of potassium sulphate
and charcoal to a bright-red heat. It may be prepared in solution by taking a solution
of potassium hydroxide, dividing it into two equal parts, and saturating one portion with
sulphuretted hydrogen so long as it is absorbed. This portion will then contain the acid
salt KHS (Note <a href="#Footnote_21_287">21</a>). The two portions are then mixed together, and potassium sulphide
will then be obtained in the solution. This solution has a strongly alkaline reaction, and
is colourless when freshly prepared, but it very easily undergoes change when exposed to
the air, forming potassium thiosulphate and polysulphides. When the solution is evaporated
at low temperatures under the receiver of an air-pump, it yields crystals containing
K<sub>2</sub>S,5H<sub>2</sub>O (heated at 150°, they part with 3 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O, and at higher temperatures
they lose nearly all their water without evolving sulphuretted hydrogen). When
they are ignited in glass vessels they corrode the glass. When a solution of caustic
potash, completely saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen, is evaporated under the
receiver of an air-pump it forms colourless rhombohedra of <i>potassium hydrosulphide</i>,
2(KHS),H<sub>2</sub>O,K<sub>2</sub>S,H<sub>2</sub>S,H<sub>2</sub>O. These crystals are deliquescent in the air, but do not
change in a vacuum when heated up to 170°, and at higher temperatures they lose
water but do not evolve sulphuretted hydrogen. The anhydrous compound, KHS,
fuses at a dark-red heat into a very mobile yellow liquid, which gradually becomes
darker in colour and solidifies to a red mass. It is remarkable that when a solution of
the compound KHS is boiled it somewhat easily evolves half its sulphuretted hydrogen,
leaving potassium sulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S, in solution; and a solution of the latter in water is
also able to evolve sulphuretted hydrogen on prolonged boiling, but the evolution
cannot be rendered complete, and, therefore, at a certain temperature, a solution of
potassium sulphide will not be capable of absorbing sulphuretted hydrogen at all. From
this we must conclude that potassium hydroxide, water, and sulphuretted hydrogen
form a system whose complex equilibrium is subject to the laws of dissociation, depends
on the relative mass of each substance, on the temperature, and the dissociation pressure
of the component elements. Potassium sulphide is not only soluble in water, but also in
alcohol.</p>

<p>Berzelius showed that in addition to potassium sulphide there also exist potassium
bisulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>; trisulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>; tetrasulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>; and pentasulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>.
According to the researches of Schöne, the last three are the most stable. These
different compounds of potassium and sulphur may be prepared by fusing potassium
hydroxide or carbonate with an excess of sulphur in a porcelain crucible in a stream of
carbonic anhydride. At about 600° potassium pentasulphide is formed; this is the
highest sulphur compound of potassium. When heated to 800° it loses one-fifth of its
sulphur and gives the tetrasulphide, which at this temperature is stable. At a bright-red
heat&mdash;namely, at about 900°&mdash;the trisulphide is formed. This compound may be also
formed by igniting potassium carbonate in a stream of carbon bisulphide, in which case
a compound, K<sub>2</sub>CS<sub>3</sub>, is first formed corresponding to potassium carbonate, and carbonic
anhydride is evolved. On further ignition this compound splits up into carbon and
potassium trisulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>. The tetrasulphide may also be obtained in solution if a
solution of potassium sulphide be boiled with the requisite amount of sulphur without
access of air. This solution yields red crystals of the composition K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O when
it is evaporated in a vacuum. These crystals are very hygroscopic, easily soluble in
water, but very sparingly in alcohol; when ignited they give off water, sulphuretted
hydrogen, and sulphur. If a solution of potassium sulphide be boiled with an excess of
sulphur it forms the pentasulphide, which, however, is decomposed on prolonged boiling
into sulphuretted hydrogen and potassium thiosulphate: K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>S.
A substance called <i>liver of sulphur</i> was formerly frequently used in chemistry and
medicine. Under this name is known the substance which is formed by boiling a
solution of caustic potash with an excess of flowers of sulphur. This solution contains a
mixture of potassium pentasulphide and thiosulphate, 6KHO + 12S = 2K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
+ 3H<sub>2</sub>O. The substance obtained by fusing potassium carbonate with an excess of
sulphur was also known as liver of sulphur. If this mixture be heated to an incipient
dark-red heat it will contain potassium thiosulphate, but at higher temperatures potassium
sulphate is formed. In either case a polysulphide of potassium is also present.
The sulphides of sodium, for example Na<sub>2</sub>S, NaHS, &amp;c., in many respects closely resemble
the corresponding potassium compounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_294" id="Footnote_28_294"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_294"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> The metals of the alkaline earths, like those of the alkalis, form several compounds
with sulphur; thus calcium forms compounds with one and with five atoms of sulphur.
There are doubtless also intermediate sulphides. If sulphuretted hydrogen be passed
over ignited lime it forms water and <i>calcium sulphide</i>, which may also be formed by
heating calcium sulphate with charcoal, whilst if sulphur be heated with lime or with
calcium carbonate, then naturally oxygen compounds (calcium thiosulphate and sulphate)
are formed at the same time as calcium sulphide. The prolonged action of the vapour
of carbon bisulphide, especially when mixed with carbonic anhydride, on strongly ignited
calcium carbonate entirely converts it into sulphide. Calcium sulphide is generally
obtained as an almost colourless, opaque, brittle mass, which is infusible at a white heat,
and is soluble in water. The act of solution (as with K<sub>2</sub>S, Note <a href="#Footnote_21_287">21</a>) is partly accompanied
by a double decomposition with the water. When heated, dry calcium sulphide does not
absorb oxygen from the air. An excess of water decomposes it, like many other metallic
sulphides, precipitating lime (as a product of the decomposition the lime hinders the
action of the water upon the CaS; see soda refuse, Chapter XII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_12_731">12</a>), and forming
a hydrosulphide, CaH<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, in solution. This compound is also formed by passing sulphuretted
hydrogen through an aqueous solution of calcium sulphide or lime. Its solution,
like that of calcium sulphide, has an alkaline reaction. It decomposes when evaporated,
and absorbs oxygen from the air. <i>Calcium pentasulphide</i>, CaS<sub>5</sub>, is not known in a pure
state, but may be obtained in admixture with calcium thiosulphate by boiling a solution
of lime or calcium sulphide with sulphur: 3CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 12S = 2CaS<sub>5</sub> + CaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O. A
similar compound in an impure form is formed by the action of air on alkali waste, and is
used for the preparation of thiosulphates.</p>

<p>Many of the sulphides of the metals of the alkaline earths are phosphorescent&mdash;that
is, they have the faculty of <i>emitting light</i>, after having been subjected to the
action of sunlight, or of any bright source of light (Canton phosphorus, &amp;c.). The
luminosity lasts some time, but it is not permanent, and gradually disappears. This
phosphorescent property is inherent, in a greater or less degree, to nearly all substances
(Becquerel), but for a very short time, whilst with calcium sulphide it is comparatively
durable, lasting for several hours, and Dewar (1894) showed that it is far more intense at
very low temperatures (for instance, in bodies cooled in liquid oxygen to -182°). It is
due to the excitation of the surfaces of substances by the action of light, and is determined
by those rays which exhibit a chemical action. Hence daylight or the light of
burning magnesium, &amp;c., acts more powerfully than the light of a lamp, &amp;c. Warnerke
has shown that a small quantity of magnesium lighted near the surface of a phosphorescent
substance rapidly excites the greatest possible intensity of luminosity; this
enabled him to found a method of measuring the intensity of light&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to obtain a
constant unit of light&mdash;and to apply it to photography. The nature of the change which
is accomplished on the surface of the luminous substance is at present unknown, but in
any case it is a renewable one, because the experiment may be repeated for an infinite
number of times and takes place in a vacuum. The intensity and tint of the light
emitted depend on the method of preparation of the calcium sulphide, and on the
degree of ignition and purity of the calcium carbonate taken. According to the observations
of Becquerel, the presence of compounds of manganese, bismuth, &amp;c., sodium
sulphide (but not potassium sulphide), &amp;c., although in minute traces, is perfectly
indispensable. This gives reason for thinking that the formation (in the dark) and
decomposition (in light) of double salts like MnS,Na<sub>2</sub>S perhaps form the chemical cause
of the phenomena. Compounds of strontium and barium have this property to even a
greater extent than calcium sulphide. These compounds may be prepared as in the
following example: A mixture of sodium thiosulphate and strontium chloride is prepared;
a double decomposition takes place between the salts, and, on the addition of alcohol,
strontium thiosulphate, SrS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is precipitated, which, when ignited, leaves strontium
sulphide behind. The strontium sulphide thus prepared emits (when dry) a greenish
yellow light. It contains a certain amount of sulphur, sodium sulphide, and strontium
sulphate. By ignition at various temperatures, and by different methods of preparation,
it is possible to obtain mixtures which emit different coloured lights.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_295" id="Footnote_29_295"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_295"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> As examples, we will describe the sulphides of arsenic, antimony, and mercury.
Arsenic trisulphide, or <i>orpiment</i>, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, occurs native, and is obtained pure when a
solution of arsenious anhydride in the presence of hydrochloric acid comes into contact
with sulphuretted hydrogen (there is no precipitate in the absence of free acid). A
beautiful yellow precipitate is then obtained: As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>S = 3H<sub>2</sub>O + As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>; it fuses
when heated, and volatilises without decomposition. As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> is easily obtained in a
colloid form (Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_57_104">57</a>). When fused it forms a semi-transparent, yellow
mass, and it is thus that it enters the market. The specific gravity of native orpiment
is 3·4, and that of the artificially-fused mass is 2·7. It is used as a yellow pigment, and
owing to its insolubility in water and acids it is less injurious than the other compounds
corresponding to arsenious acid. According to the type AsX<sub>2</sub>, realgar, AsS, is known,
but it is probable that the true composition of this compound is As<sub>4</sub>S<sub>4</sub>&mdash;that is, it
presents the same relation to orpiment as liquid phosphuretted hydrogen does to
gaseous. <i>Realgar</i> (<i>Sandaraca</i>) occurs native as brilliant red crystals of specific gravity
3·59, and may be prepared artificially by fusing arsenic and sulphur in the proportions
indicated by its formulæ. It is prepared in large quantities by distilling a mixture of
sulphur and arsenical pyrites. Like orpiment it dissolves in calcium sulphide, and even
in caustic potash. It is used for signal lights and fireworks, because it deflagrates and
gives a large and very brilliant white flame with nitre.</p>

<p>With antimony, sulphur gives a tri- and a pentasulphide. The former, Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, which
corresponds with antimonious oxide, occurs native (Chapter <a href="#Page_149">XIX.</a>) in a crystalline form;
its sp. gr. is then 4·9, and it presents brilliant rhombic crystals of a grey colour, which
fuse when heated. A substance of the same composition is obtained as an amorphous
orange powder by passing sulphuretted hydrogen into an acid solution of antimonious
oxide. In this respect antimonious oxide again reacts like arsenious acid, and the sulphides
of both are soluble in ammonium and potassium sulphides, and, especially in
the case of arsenious sulphide, are easily obtained in colloidal solutions. By prolonged
boiling with water, antimonious sulphide may be entirely converted into the oxide,
hydrogen sulphide being evolved (Elbers). Native antimony sulphide, or the orange
precipitated trisulphide when fused with dry, or boiled with dissolved, alkalis, forms a
dark-coloured mass (Kermes mineral) formerly much used in medicine, which contains
a mixture of antimonious sulphide and oxide. There are also compounds of these substances.
A so-called antimony vermilion is much used as a dye; it is prepared by
boiling sodium thiosulphate (six parts) with antimony trichloride (five parts) and water
(fifty parts). This substance probably contains an oxysulphide of antimony&mdash;that is, a
portion of the oxygen in the oxide of antimony in it is replaced by sulphur. Red antimony
ore, and antimony glass, which is obtained by fusing the trisulphide with
antimonious oxide, have a similar composition, Sb<sub>2</sub>OS<sub>2</sub>. In the arts, the <i>antimony pentasulphide</i>,
Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>, is the most frequently used of the sulphur compounds of antimony. It
is formed by the action of acids on the so-called Schlippe's salt, which is a <i>sodium
thiorthantimonate</i>, SbS(NaS)<sub>3</sub>, corresponding with (Chapter XIX., Note <a href="#Footnote_41_BIS_252">41 bis</a>) orthantimonic
acid, SbO(OH)<sub>3</sub>, with the replacement of oxygen by sulphur. It is obtained by
boiling finely-powdered native antimony trisulphide with twice its weight of sodium
carbonate, and half its weight of sulphur and lime, in the presence of a considerable
quantity of water. The processes taking place are as follows:&mdash;The sodium carbonate is
converted into hydroxide by the lime, and then forms sodium sulphide with the sulphur;
the sodium sulphide then dissolves the antimony sulphide, which in this form already
combines with the greatest amount of sulphur, so that a compound is formed corresponding
with antimony pentasulphide dissolved in sodium sulphide. The solution is
filtered and crystallised, care being taken to prevent access of air, which oxidises the
sodium sulphide. This salt crystallises in large, yellowish crystals, which are easily
soluble in water and have the composition Na<sub>3</sub>SbS<sub>4</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O. When heated they lose their
water of crystallisation and then fuse without alteration; but when in solution, and even
in crystalline form, this salt turns brown in air, owing to the oxidation of the sulphur
and the breaking up of the compound. As it is used in medicine, especially in the preparation
of antimony pentasulphide, it is kept under a layer of alcohol, in which it is
insoluble. Acids precipitate antimony pentasulphide from a solution of this salt, as an
orange powder, insoluble in acids and very frequently used in medicine (<i>sulfur auratum
antimonii</i>). This substance when heated evolves vapours of sulphur, and leaves antimony
trisulphide behind.</p>

<p>Mercury forms compounds with sulphur of the same types as it does with oxygen.
Mercurous sulphide, Hg<sub>2</sub>S, easily splits up into mercury and mercuric sulphide. It is
obtained by the action of potassium sulphide on mercurous chloride, and also by the
action of sulphuretted hydrogen on solutions of salts of the type HgX. Mercuric sulphide,
HgS, corresponding with the oxide, is cinnabar; it is obtained as a black precipitate
by the action of an excess of sulphuretted hydrogen on solutions of mercuric salts.
It is insoluble in acids, and is therefore precipitated in their presence. If a certain
amount of water containing sulphuretted hydrogen be added to a solution of mercuric
chloride, it first gives a white precipitate of the composition Hg<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that is, a compound
HgCl,2HgS, a sulphochloride of mercury like the oxychloride. But in the presence
of an excess of sulphuretted hydrogen, the black precipitate of mercuric sulphide
is formed. In this state it is not crystalline (the red variety is formed by the prolonged
action of polysulphides of ammonium upon the black HgS), but if it be heated to its
temperature of volatilisation it forms a red crystalline sublimate which is identical with
native cinnabar. In this form its specific gravity is 8·0, and it forms a red powder, owing
to which it is used as a red pigment (vermilion) in oil, pastel, and other paints. It is so
little attacked by reagents that even nitric acid has no action on it, and the gastric
juices do not dissolve it, so that it is not poisonous. When heated in air, the sulphur
burns away and leaves metallic mercury. On a large scale cinnabar is usually prepared
in the following manner: 300 parts of mercury and 115 parts of sulphur are mixed
together as intimately as possible and poured into a solution of 75 parts of caustic potash
in 425 parts of water, and the mixture is heated at 50° for several hours. Red mercury
sulphide is thus formed, and separates out from the solution. The reaction which takes
place is as follows: A soluble compound, K<sub>2</sub>HgS<sub>2</sub>, is first formed; this compound is able
to separate in colourless silky needles, which are soluble in the caustic potash, but are
decomposed by water, and at 50°; this solution (perhaps by attracting oxygen from the
air) slowly deposits HgS in a crystalline form.</p>

<p>Spring conducted an interesting research (at Liège, 1894) upon the conversion of the
black amorphous sulphide of mercury, HgS, into red crystalline cinnabar. This research
formed a sequel to Spring's classical researches on the influence of high pressures upon
the properties of solids and their capacity for mutual combination. He showed, among
other things, that ordinary solids and even metals (for instance, Pb), after being considerably
compressed under a pressure of 20,000 atmospheres, return on removal of the
pressure to their original density like gases. But this is only true when the compressed
solid is not liable to an allotropic variation, and does not give a denser variety. Thus
prismatic sulphur (sp. gr. 1·9) passes under pressure into the octahedral (sp. gr. 2·05)
variety. Black HgS (precipitated from solution) has a sp. gr. 7·6, while that of the red
variety is 8·2, and therefore it might be expected that the former would pass into the latter
under pressure, but experiments both at the ordinary and a higher temperature did not
give the looked-for result, because even at a pressure of 20,000 atmospheres the black
sulphide was not compressed to the density of cinnabar (a pressure of as much as
35,000  atmospheres was necessary, which could not be attained in the experiment). But
Spring prepared a black HgS, which had a sp. gr. of 8·0, and this, under a pressure of
2,500 atmospheres, passed into cinnabar. He obtained this peculiar black variety of
HgS (sp. gr. 8·0) by distilling cinnabar in an atmosphere of CO<sub>2</sub>, when the greater
portion of the HgS is redeposited in the form of cinnabar. Under the action of a solution
of polysulphide of ammonium, this variety of HgS passes more slowly into the red
variety than the precipitated variety does, while under pressure the conversion is comparatively
easy.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that Linder and Picton obtained complex compounds of
many of the sulphides of the heavy metals (Ca, Hg, Sb, Zn, Cd, Ag, Au) with H<sub>2</sub>S, for
example H<sub>2</sub>S,7CuS (by the action of H<sub>2</sub>S upon the hydrate of oxide of copper),
H<sub>2</sub>S,9CuS (in the presence of acetic acid and with an excess of H<sub>2</sub>S), &amp;c. Probably we
have here a sort of &lsquo;solid&rsquo; solution of H<sub>2</sub>S in the metallic sulphides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_BIS_300" id="Footnote_32_BIS_300"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_BIS_300"><span class="label">[32 bis]</span></a> Sulphurous anhydride is also obtained by the decomposition of many sulphates,
especially of the heavy metals, by the action of heat; but this requires a very powerful
heat. This formation of sulphurous anhydride from sulphates is based on the decomposition
proper to sulphuric acid itself. When sulphuric acid is strongly heated (for
instance, by dropping it upon an incandescent surface) it is decomposed into water,
oxygen, and sulphurous anhydride&mdash;that is, into those compounds from which it is
formed. A similar decomposition proceeds during the ignition of many sulphates. Even
so stable a sulphate as gypsum does not resist the action of very high temperatures, but
is decomposed in the same manner, lime being left behind. The decomposition of sulphates
by heat is accomplished with still greater facility in the presence of sulphur,
because in this case the liberated oxygen combines with the sulphur and the metal is
able to form a sulphide. Thus when ferrous sulphate (green vitriol) is ignited with sulphur,
it gives ferrous sulphide and sulphurous anhydride: FeSO<sub>4</sub> + 2S = FeS + 2SO<sub>2</sub>, and
this reaction may even be used for the preparation of this gas. At 400° sulphuric acid
and sulphur give an extremely uniform stream of pure sulphurous anhydride, so that it
is best prepared on a manufacturing scale by this method. Iron pyrites, FeS<sub>2</sub>, when
heated to 150° with sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1·75) in cast-iron vessels also gives an abundant
and uniform supply of sulphurous anhydride.</p></div>

molecule of hydrogen H<sub>2</sub>, in combining with oxygen (O = 16) develops about 69,000 heat
units, whilst the molecule of SO<sub>2</sub>, in combining with oxygen only develops about 32,000
heat units&mdash;that is, about half as much&mdash;and therefore those metals which cannot decompose
water may still be able to deoxidise sulphuric into sulphurous acid. Those metals
which decompose water and sulphuric acid with the evolution of hydrogen, evolve
in combining with sixteen parts by weight of oxygen more heat than hydrogen does&mdash;for
example, K<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>, Ca develop about or more than 100,000 heat units; Fe, Zn, Mn about
70,000 to 80,000 heat units; whilst those metals which neither decompose water nor evolve
hydrogen from sulphuric acid, but are still capable of evolving sulphurous anhydride from
it, develop less heat with oxygen than hydrogen, but nearly the same amount, if not more
than, sulphurous anhydride develops&mdash;for example, Cu and Hg develop about 40,000 and
Pb about 50,000 heat units.</p></div>

of gases. Lead dioxide, PbO<sub>2</sub>, is brown, and when combined with sulphurous anhydride
it forms lead sulphate, PbSO<sub>4</sub>, which is white, so that the reaction is evident both
from the change in colour and development of heat. Sulphurous anhydride is slowly
decomposed by the action of light, with the separation of sulphur and formation of sulphuric
anhydride. This explains the fact that sulphurous anhydride prepared in the
dark gives a white precipitate of silver sulphite, Ag<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, with silver chlorate, AgClO<sub>4</sub>,
but when prepared in the light, even in diffused light, it gives a dark precipitate. This
naturally depends on the fact that the sulphur liberated then forms silver sulphide,
which is black.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_309" id="Footnote_39_309"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_309"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Schönebein observed that the liquid turns yellow, and acquires the faculty of
decolorising litmus and indigo. Schützenberger showed that this depends on the formation
of a zinc salt of a peculiar and very powerfully-reducing acid, for with cupric salts
the yellow solution gives a red precipitate of cuprous hydrate or metallic copper, and it
reduces salts of silver and mercury entirely. An exactly similar solution is obtained by
the action of zinc on sodium bisulphite without access of air and in the cold. The
yellow liquid absorbs oxygen from the air with great avidity, and forms a sulphate. If
the solution be mixed with alcohol, it deposits a double sulphite of zinc and sodium,
ZnNa<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, which does not decolorise litmus or indigo. The remaining alcoholic solution
deposits colourless crystals in the cold, which absorb oxygen with great energy in
the presence of water, but are tolerably stable when dried under the receiver of an air-pump.
The solution of these crystals has the above-mentioned decolorising and reducing
properties. These crystals contain a sodium salt of a lower acid; their composition was
at first supposed to be HNaSO<sub>2</sub>, but it was afterwards proved that they do not contain
hydrogen, and present the composition Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (Bernthsen). The same salt is formed
by the action of a galvanic current on a solution of sodium bisulphite, owing to the
action of the hydrogen at the moment of its liberation. If SO<sub>2</sub> resembles CO<sub>2</sub> in its
composition, then hyposulphurous acid H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> resembles oxalic acid H<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Perhaps
an analogue of formic acid SH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> will be discovered.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_310" id="Footnote_40_310"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_310"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> The instability of this salt is very great, and may be compared to that of the compound
of ferrous sulphate with nitric oxide, for when heated under the contact
influence of spongy platinum, charcoal, &amp;c., it splits up into potassium sulphate and
nitrous oxide. At 130° the dry salt gives off nitric oxide, and re-forms potassium sulphite.
The free acid has not yet been obtained. These salts resemble the series of
<i>sulphonitrites</i> discovered by Frémy in 1845. They are obtained by passing sulphurous
anhydride through a concentrated and strongly alkaline aqueous solution of potassium
nitrite. They are soluble in water, but are precipitated by an excess of alkali. The first
product of the action has the composition K<sub>3</sub>NS<sub>3</sub>HO<sub>9</sub>. It is then converted by the
further action of sulphurous anhydride, cold water, and other reagents into a series of
similar complex salts, many of which give well-formed crystals. One must suppose that
the chief cause of the formation of these very complex compounds is that they contain
unsaturated compounds, NO, KNO<sub>2</sub>, and KHSO<sub>3</sub>, all of which are subject to oxidation
and further combination, and therefore easily combine among each other. The decomposition
of these compounds, with the evolution of ammonia, when their solutions are
heated is due to the fact that the molecule contains the deoxidant, sulphurous anhydride,
which reduces the nitrous acid, NO(OH), to ammonia. In my opinion the composition
of the sulphonitrites may be very simply referred to the composition of ammonia, in
which the hydrogen is partly replaced by the radicle of the sulphates. If we represent
the composition of potassium sulphate as KO.KSO<sub>3</sub>, the group KSO<sub>3</sub> will be equivalent
(according to the law of substitution) to HO and to hydrogen. It combines with
hydrogen, forming the potassium acid sulphite, KHSO<sub>3</sub>. Hence the group KSO<sub>3</sub> may
also replace the hydrogen in ammonia. Judging by my analysis (1870) the extreme
limit of this substitution, N(HSO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, agrees with that of the sulphonitrite, which is
easily formed, simultaneously with alkali, by the action of potassium sulphite on potassium
nitrite, according to the equation 3K(KSO<sub>3</sub>) + KNO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = N(KSO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 4HKO.
The researches of Berglund, and especially of Raschig (1887), fully verified my conclusions,
and showed that we must distinguish the following types of salts, corresponding
with ammonia, where X stands for the sulphonic group, HSO<sub>3</sub>, in which the hydrogen is
replaced by potassium; hence X = KSO<sub>3</sub>: (1) NH<sub>2</sub>X, (2) NHX<sub>2</sub>, (3) NH<sub>3</sub>, (4) N(OH)XH,
(5) N(OH)X<sub>2</sub>, (6) N(OH)<sub>2</sub>X, just as NH<sub>2</sub>(OH) is hydroxylamine, NH(OH)<sub>2</sub>, is the hydrate
of nitrous oxide, and N(OH)<sub>3</sub> is orthonitrous acid, as follows from the law of substitution.
This class of compounds is in most intimate relation with the series of sulphonitrous
compounds, corresponding with &lsquo;chamber crystals&rsquo; and their acids, which we
shall consider later.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_311" id="Footnote_41_311"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_311"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> In the sulphuric acid chambers the lower oxides of nitrogen and sulphur take part
in the reaction. They are oxidised by the oxygen of the air, and form nitro-sulphuric
acid&mdash;for example, 2SO<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2NHSO<sub>5</sub>. This compound dissolves in strong
sulphuric acid without changing, and when this solution is diluted (when the sp. gr. falls
to 1·5), it splits up into sulphuric acid and nitrous anhydride, and by the action of sulphurous
anhydride is converted into nitric oxide, which by itself (in the absence of nitric
acid or oxygen) is insoluble in sulphuric acid. These reactions are taken advantage of
in retaining the oxides of nitrogen in the Gay-Lussac coke-towers, and for extracting the
absorbed oxides of nitrogen from the resultant solution in the Glover tower. Although
nitric oxide is not absorbed by sulphuric acid, it reacts (Rose, Brüning) on its anhydride,
and forms sulphurous anhydride and a crystalline substance, N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub> = 2NO + 3SO<sub>3</sub> - SO<sub>2</sub>
= N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>2SO<sub>3</sub>. This may be regarded as the anhydride of nitro-sulphuric acid, because
N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub> = 2NHSO<sub>5</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O; like nitro-sulphuric acid, it is decomposed by water into
nitro-sulphuric acid and nitrous anhydride. Since boric and arsenious anhydrides,
alumina and other oxides of the form R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are able to combine with sulphuric anhydride
to form similar compounds decomposable by water, the above compound does not present
any exceptional phenomenon. The substance NOClSO<sub>3</sub> obtained by Weber by the
action of nitrosyl chloride upon sulphuric anhydride belongs to this class of compounds.</p></div>

the air it first forms a calcium polysulphide, and then calcium thiosulphate, CaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
When iron or zinc acts on a solution of sulphurous acid, besides the hyposulphurous acid
first formed, a mixture of sulphite and thiosulphate is obtained (Note <a href="#Footnote_39_309">39</a>), 3SO<sub>2</sub> + Zn<sub>2</sub>
= ZnSO<sub>3</sub> + ZnS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. In this case, as in the formation of hyposulphurous acid, there is
no hydrogen liberated. One of the most common methods for preparing thiosulphates
consists in the <i>action of sulphur on the alkalis</i>. The reaction is accomplished by the
formation of sulphides and thiosulphates, just as the reaction of chlorine on alkalis is
accompanied by the formation of hypochlorites and chlorides; hence in this respect the
thiosulphates hold the same position in the order of the compounds of sulphur as the
hypochlorites do among the chlorine compounds. The reaction of caustic soda on
an excess of sulphur may be expressed thus: 6NaHO + 12S = 2Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O.
Thus sulphur is soluble in alkalis. On a large scale sodium thiosulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is
prepared by first heating sodium sulphate with charcoal, to form sodium sulphide, which
is then dissolved in water and treated with sulphurous anhydride. The reaction is complete
when the solution has become slightly acid. A certain amount of caustic alkali is
added to the slightly acid solution; a portion of the sulphur is thus precipitated, and the
solution is then boiled and evaporated when the salt crystallises out. The saturation
of the solution of sodium sulphide by sulphurous anhydride is carried on in different
ways&mdash;for example, by means of coke-towers, by causing the solution of sulphide to
trickle over the coke, and the sulphurous anhydride, obtained by burning sulphur, to
pass up the coke-tower from below. An excess of sulphurous anhydride must be
avoided, as otherwise sodium trithionate is formed. Sodium thiophosphate is also prepared
by the double decomposition of the soluble calcium thiosulphate with sodium sulphate
or carbonate, in which case calcium sulphate or carbonate is precipitated. The
calcium thiosulphate is prepared by the action of sulphurous anhydride on either calcium
sulphide or alkali waste. A dilute solution of calcium thiosulphate may be obtained by
treating alkali waste which has been exposed to the action of air with water. On evaporation,
this solution gives crystals of the salt containing CaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O. A solution of
calcium thiosulphate must be evaporated with great care, because otherwise the salt
breaks up into sulphur and calcium sulphide. Even the crystallised salt sometimes
undergoes this change.</p>

<p>The crystals of sodium thiosulphate are stable, do not effloresce and at 0° dissolve in
one part of water, and at 20° in 0·6 part. The solution of this salt does not undergo
any change when boiled for a short time, but after prolonged boiling it deposits sulphur.
The crystals fuse at 56°, and lose all their water at 100°. When the dry salt is ignited
it gives sodium sulphide and sulphate. With acids, a solution of the thiosulphate soon
becomes cloudy and deposits an exceedingly fine powder of sulphur (Note <a href="#Footnote_10_274">10</a>). If the
amount of acid added be considerable, it also evolves sulphurous anhydride: H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
= H<sub>2</sub>O + S + SO<sub>2</sub>. Sodium thiosulphate has many practical uses; it is used in photography
for dissolving silver chloride and bromide. Its solvent action on silver chloride
may be taken advantage of in extracting this metal as chloride from its ores. In
dissolving, it forms a double salt of silver and sodium: AgCl + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = NaCl
+ AgNaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Sodium thiosulphate is an <i>antichlor</i>&mdash;that is, a substance which hinders
the destructive action of free chlorine owing to its being very easily oxidised by chlorine
into sulphuric acid and sodium chloride. The reaction with iodine is different, and is
remarkable for the accuracy with which it proceeds. The iodine takes up half the
sodium from the salt and converts it into a tetrathionate; 2Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> = 2NaI + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,
and hence this reaction is employed for the determination of free iodine. As iodine is
expelled from potassium iodide by chlorine, it is possible also to determine the amount
of chlorine by this method if potassium iodide be added to a solution containing chlorine.
And as many of the higher oxides are able to evolve iodine from potassium iodide, or
chlorine from hydrochloric acid (for example, the higher oxides of manganese, chromium,
&amp;c.), it is also possible to determine the amounts of these higher oxides by means of
sodium thiosulphate and liberated iodine. This forms the basis of the iodometric method
of volumetric analysis. The details of these methods will be found in works on analytical
chemistry.</p>

<p>On adding a solution of a <i>lead salt</i> gradually to a solution of sodium thiosulphate a
white precipitate of lead thiosulphate, PbS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is formed (a soluble double salt is first
formed, and if the action be rapid, lead sulphide). When this substance is heated at
200°, it undergoes a change and takes fire. Sodium thiosulphate in solution rapidly
reduces cupric salts to cuprous salts by means of the sulphurous acid contained in the
thiosulphate, but the resultant cuprous oxide is not precipitated, because it passes into
the state of a thiosulphate and forms a double salt. These double cuprous salts are
excellent reducing agents. The solution when heated gives a black precipitate of copper
sulphide.</p>

<p>At one time it was thought that all the salts of thiosulphuric acid only existed in
combination with water, and it was then supposed that their composition was H<sub>4</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, or
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>2</sub>, but Popp obtained the anhydrous salts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_314" id="Footnote_43_314"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_314"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Nordhausen sulphuric acid may serve as a very simple means for the preparation
of sulphuric anhydride. For this purpose the Nordhausen acid is heated in a glass
retort, whose neck is firmly fixed in the mouth of a well-cooled flask. The access of
moisture is prevented by connecting the receiver with a drying-tube. On heating the
retort the vapours of sulphuric anhydride will pass over into the receiver, where they
condense; the crystals of anhydride thus prepared will, however, contain traces of
sulphuric acid&mdash;that is, of the hydrate. By repeatedly distilling over phosphoric
anhydride, it is possible to obtain the pure anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, especially if the process be
carried on without access of air in a closed vessel.</p>

<p>The ordinary sulphuric anhydride, which is imperfectly freed from the hydrate, is a
snow-white, exceedingly volatile substance, which crystallises (generally by sublimation)
in long silky prisms, and only gives the pure anhydride when carefully distilled over
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Freshly prepared crystals of almost pure anhydride fuse at 16° into a colourless
liquid having a specific gravity at 26° = 1·91, and at 47° = 1·81; it volatilises at 46°. After
being kept for some time the anhydride, even containing only small traces of water,
undergoes a change of the following nature: A small quantity of sulphuric acid combines
by degrees with a large proportion of the anhydride, forming polysulphuric acids,
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,<i>n</i>SO<sub>3</sub>, which fuse with difficulty (even at 100°, Marignac), but decompose when
heated. In the entire absence of water this rise in the fusing point does not occur
(Weber), and then the anhydride long remains liquid, and solidifies at about +15°, volatilises
at 40°, and has a specific gravity 1·94 at 16°. We may add that Weber (1881), by
treating sulphuric anhydride with sulphur, obtained a blue lower oxide of sulphur, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
Selenium and tellurium also give similar products with SO<sub>3</sub>, SeSO<sub>3</sub>, and TeSO<sub>3</sub>. Water
does not act upon them.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_315" id="Footnote_44_315"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_315"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> Pyrosulphuric chloranhydride, or <i>pyrosulphuryl chloride</i>, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, corresponds
to pyrosulphuric acid, in the same way that sulphuryl chloride, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, corresponds
to sulphuric acid. The composition S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> = SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub>. It is obtained by the
action of the vapour of sulphuric anhydride on sulphur chloride: S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 5SO<sub>3</sub> = 5SO<sub>2</sub>
+ S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. It is also formed (and not sulphuryl chloride, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, Michaelis) by the action
of phosphorus pentachloride in excess on sulphuric acid (or its first chloranhydride,
SHO<sub>3</sub>Cl). It is an oily liquid, boiling at about 150°, and of sp. gr. 1·8. According to
Konovaloff (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_299">VII.</a>), its vapour density is normal. It should be noticed that the
same substance is obtained by the action of sulphuric anhydride on sulphur tetrachloride,
and also on carbon tetrachloride, and this substance is the last product of the metalepsis
of CH<sub>4</sub>, and therefore the comparison of SCl<sub>2</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> with products of metalepsis (<i>see</i>
later) also finds confirmation in particular reactions. Rose, who obtained pyrosulphuryl
chloride, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, regarded it as SCl<sub>6</sub>,5SO<sub>3</sub>, for at that time an endeavour was always
made to find two component parts of opposite polarity, and this substance was cited as a
proof of the existence of a hexachloride, SCl<sub>6</sub>. Pyrosulphuryl chloride is decomposed by
cold water, but more slowly than chlorosulphuric acid and the other chloranhydrides.</p>

<p>The relation between pyrosulphuric acid and the normal acid will be obvious if we
express the latter by the formula OH(SO<sub>3</sub>H), because the sulphonic group (SO<sub>3</sub>H) is
then evidently equivalent to OH, and consequently to H, and if we replace both the
hydrogens in water by this radicle we shall obtain (SO<sub>3</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;that is, pyrosulphuric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_316" id="Footnote_45_316"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_316"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> The removal of the water, or concentration to almost the real acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, is
effected for two reasons: in the first place to avoid the expense of transit (it is cheaper
to remove the water than to pay for its transit), and in the second place because many
processes&mdash;for instance, the refining of petroleum&mdash;require a strong acid free from an
excess of water, the weak acid having no action. When in the manufacture of chamber
acid, both the Gay-Lussac tower (cold, situated at the end of the chambers) and the
Glover tower (hot, situated at the beginning of the plant, between the chambers and
ovens for the production of SO<sub>2</sub>) are employed, a mixture of nitrose (<i>i.e.</i> the product of
the Gay-Lussac tower) and chamber acid containing about 60 p.c. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, is poured
into the Glover tower, where under the action of the hot furnace gases containing SO<sub>2</sub>,
and the water held in the chamber acid (1) N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is evolved from the nitrose; (2) water
is expelled from the chamber acid; (3) a portion of the SO<sub>2</sub> is converted into H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>;
and (4) the furnace gases are cooled. Thus, amongst other things, the Glover tower
facilitates the concentration of the chamber acid (removal of H<sub>2</sub>O), but the product
generally contains many impurities.</p></div>

fact that the boiling becomes very irregular, totally ceasing at one moment, then suddenly
starting again, with the rapid formation of a considerable amount of steam, and at the
same time bumping and even overturning the vessel in which it is held. Hence it is not
a rare occurrence for the glass retorts to break during the distillation; this causes
platinum retorts to be preferred, as the boiling then proceeds quite uniformly.</p></div>

<p>The latter figures give the temperature at which water is easily expelled from solutions
of sulphuric acid of different strengths. But the evaporation begins sooner, and
concentration may be carried on at lower temperatures if a stream of air be passed
through the acid. Kessler's process is based upon this (Note <a href="#Footnote_48_319">48</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_319" id="Footnote_48_319"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_319"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> The greatest part of the sulphuric acid is used in the soda manufacture, in the
conversion of the common salt into sulphate. For this purpose an acid having a
density of 60° Baumé is amply sufficient. Chamber acid has a density up to 1·57 = 50° to
51° Baumé; it contains about 35 per cent. of water. About 15 per cent. of this water can
be removed in leaden stills, and nearly all the remainder may be expelled in glass or
platinum vessels. Acid of 66° Baumé, = 1·847, contains about 96 per cent. of the hydrate
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The density falls with a greater or less proportion of water, the maximum
density corresponding with 97&frac12; per cent. of the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The concentration of
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in platinum retorts has the disadvantage that sulphuric acid, upwards of 90
per cent. in strength, does corrode platinum, although but slightly (a few grams per tens
of tons of acid). The retorts therefore require repairing, and the cost of the platinum
exceeds the price obtained for concentrating the acid from 90 per cent. to 98 per cent. (in
factories the acid is not concentrated beyond this by evaporation in the air). This inconvenience
has lately (1891, by Mathey) been eliminated by coating the inside of the platinum
retorts with a thin (0·1 to 0·02 mm.) layer of gold which is 40 times less corroded by
sulphuric acid than platinum. Négrier (1890) carries on the distillation in porcelain
dishes, Blond by heating a thin platinum wire immersed in the acid by means of an
electric current, but the most promising method is that of Kessler (1891), which consists
in passing hot air over sulphuric acid flowing in a thin stream in stone vessels, so that
there is no boiling but only evaporation at moderate temperatures: the transference of
the heat is direct (and not through the sides of the vessels), which economises the fuel
and prevents the distilling vessels being damaged.</p>

<p>When, by evaporation of the water, sulphuric acid attains a density of 66° Baumé
(sp. gr. 1·84), it is impossible to concentrate it further, because it then distils over
unchanged. <i>The distillation of sulphuric acid</i> is not generally carried on on a large
scale, but forms a laboratory process, employed when particularly pure acid is required.
The distillation is effected either in platinum retorts furnished with corresponding condensers
and receivers, or in glass retorts. In the latter case, great caution is necessary,
because the boiling of sulphuric acid itself is accompanied by still more violent jerks and
greater irregularity than even the evaporation of the last portions of water contained in
the acid. If the glass retort which holds the strong sulphuric acid to be distilled be
heated directly from below, it frequently jerks and breaks. For greater safety the
heating is not effected from below, but at the sides of the retort. The evaporation then
does not proceed in the whole mass, but only from the upper portions of the liquid, and
therefore goes on much more quietly. The acid may be made to boil quietly also by
surrounding the retort with good conductors of heat&mdash;for example, iron filings, or by
immersing a bunch of platinum wires in the acid, as the bubbles of sulphuric acid vapour
then form on the extremities of the wires.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_320" id="Footnote_49_320"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_320"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Thus it appears that so common, and apparently so stable, a compound as sulphuric
acid decomposes even at a low temperature with separation of the anhydride, but
this decomposition is restricted by a limit, corresponding to the presence of about 1&frac12; p.c.
of water, or to a composition of nearly H<sub>2</sub>O,12H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>Now there is no reason for thinking that this substance is a definite compound;
it is an equilibrated system which does not decompose under ordinary circumstances
below 338°. Dittmar carried on the distillation under pressures varying between 30 and
2,140 millimetres (of mercury), and he found that the composition of the residue hardly
varies, and contains from 99·2 to 98·2 per cent. of the normal hydrate, although at 30 mm.
the temperature of distillation is about 210° and at 2,140 mm. it is 382°. Furthermore,
it is a fact of practical importance that under a pressure of two atmospheres the distillation
of sulphuric acid proceeds very quietly.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid may be <i>purified</i> from the majority of its impurities by distillation, if
the first and last portions of the distillate be rejected. The first portions will contain
the oxides of nitrogen, hydrochloric acid, &amp;c., and the last portions the less volatile
impurities. The oxides of nitrogen may be removed by heating the acid with charcoal,
which converts them into volatile gases. Sulphuric acid may be freed from arsenic by
heating it with manganese dioxide and then distilling. This oxidises all the arsenic into
non-volatile arsenic acid. Without a preliminary oxidation it would partially remain as
volatile arsenious acid, and might pass over into the distillate. The arsenic may also
be driven off by first reducing it to arsenious acid, and then passing hydrochloric acid
gas through the heated acid. It is then converted into arsenious chloride, which
volatilises.</p></div>

up to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub>O deposit ice (at -0°·12 when there is 2,000H<sub>2</sub>O per H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, at -0°·23
when there is 1,000H<sub>2</sub>O, at -1°·04 when there is 200H<sub>2</sub>O, at -2°·12 when there is
100H<sub>2</sub>O, at -4°·5 when there is 50H<sub>2</sub>O, at -15°·7 when there is 20H<sub>2</sub>O, and at -61° when
the composition of the solution is H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub>O); (<i>b</i>) that for higher concentrations
crystals separate out at a considerable degree of cold, having the composition
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O, which melt at -24°·5, and if either water or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> be added to this compound
the temperature of crystallisation falls, so that a solution of the composition
12H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 100H<sub>2</sub>O gives crystals of the above hydrate at -70°, 15H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 100H<sub>2</sub>O
at -47°, 30H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 100H<sub>2</sub>O at -32°, 40H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 100H<sub>2</sub>O at -52°; (<i>c</i>) that if the amount
of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> be still greater, then a hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O separates out and melts at +8°·5,
while the addition of water or sulphuric acid to it lowers the temperature of crystallisation
so that the crystallisation of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O from a solution of the composition
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 1·73H<sub>2</sub>O takes place at -22°, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 1·5H<sub>2</sub>O at -6°·5, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 1·2H<sub>2</sub>O at
+3°·7, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 0·75H<sub>2</sub>O at +2°·8, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 0·5H<sub>2</sub>O at -16°; (<i>d</i>) that when there is
less than 40H<sub>2</sub>O per 100H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, refrigeration separates out the normal hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
which melts at +10°·35, and that a solution of the composition H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 0·35H<sub>2</sub>O deposits
crystals of this hydrate at -34°, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 0·1H<sub>2</sub>O at -4°·1, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 0·05H<sub>2</sub>O at
+4°·9, while fuming acid of the composition H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 0·05SO<sub>3</sub> deposits H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> at about
+7°. Thus the temperature of the separation of crystals clearly distinguishes the
above four regions of solutions, and in the space between H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O and +25H<sub>2</sub>O
a particular hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O separates out, discovered by Pickering, the isolation
of which deserves full attention and further research. I may add here that the existence
of a hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O was pointed out in my work, <i>The Investigation of Aqueous
Solutions</i>, p. 120 (1887), upon the basis that it has at all temperatures a smaller value
for the coefficient of expansion <i>k</i> in the formula S<sub><i>t</i></sub> = S<sub>0</sub>/(1 - <i>kt</i>) than the adjacent
(in composition) solutions of sulphuric acid. And for solutions approximating to
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>10H<sub>2</sub>O in their composition, <i>k</i> is constant at all temperatures (for more dilute
solutions the value of <i>k</i> increases with <i>t</i> and for more concentrated solutions it decreases).
This solution (with 10H<sub>2</sub>O) forms the point of transition between more dilute solutions
which deposit ice (water) when refrigerated and those which give crystals of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O.
According to R. Pictet (1894) the solution H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>10H<sub>2</sub>O freezes at -88° (but no
reference is made as to what separates out), <i>i.e.</i> at a lower temperature than all the
other solutions of sulphuric acid. However, in respect to these last researches of
R. Pictet (for 88·88 p.c. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> -55°, for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O +3·5°, for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O -70°, for
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O -40°, &amp;c.) it should be remarked that they offer some quite improbable
data; for example, for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>75H<sub>2</sub>O they give the freezing point as 0°, for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>300H<sub>2</sub>O
+4°·5, and even for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>1000H<sub>2</sub>O +0°·5, although it is well known that a small amount
of sulphuric acid lowers the temperature of the formation of ice. I have found by direct
experiment that a frozen solidified solution of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 300H<sub>2</sub>O melted completely at 0°.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_323" id="Footnote_51_323"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_323"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> With an excess of snow, the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, like the normal hydrate, gives a
freezing mixture, owing to the absorption of a large amount of heat (the latent heat
of fusion). In melting, the molecule H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> absorbs 960 heat units, and the molecule
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O 3,680 heat units. If therefore we mix one gram molecule of this hydrate
with seventeen gram molecules of snow, there is an absorption of 18,080 heat units,
because 17H<sub>2</sub>O absorbs 17 × 1,430 heat units, and the combination of the monohydrate
with water evolves 9,800 heat units. As the specific heat of the resultant compound
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,18H<sub>2</sub>O = 0·813, the fall of temperature will be -52°·6. And, in fact, a very
low temperature may be obtained by means of sulphuric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_324" id="Footnote_52_324"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_324"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> For example, if it be taken that at 19° the sp. gr. of pure sulphuric acid is 1·8330,
then at 20° it is 1·8330 - (20 - 19)10·13 = 1·8320.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_325" id="Footnote_53_325"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_325"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> Unfortunately, notwithstanding the great number of fragmentary and systematic
researches which have been made (by Parks, Ure, Bineau, Kolbe, Lunge, Marignac,
Kremers, Thomsen, Perkin, and others) for determining the relation between the sp. gr.
and composition of solutions of sulphuric acid, they contain discrepancies which amount
to, and even exceed, 0·002 in the sp. gr. For instance, at 15°·4 the solution of composition
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O has a sp. gr. 1·5493 according to Perkin (1886), 1·5501 according to
Pickering (1890), and 1·5525 according to Lunge (1890). The cause of these discrepancies
must be looked for in the methods employed for determining the composition
of the solutions&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in the inaccuracy with which the percentage amount of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is
determined, for a difference of 1 p.c. corresponds to a difference of from 0·0070 (for very
weak solutions) to 0·0118 (for a solution containing about 73 p.c.) in the specific gravity (that
is the factor <i>ds/dp</i>) at 15°. As it is possible to determine the specific gravity with an
accuracy even exceeding 0·0002, the specific gravities given in the adjoining tables are
only averages and most probable data in which the error, especially for the 30&ndash;80 p.c.
solutions cannot be less than 0·0010 (taking water at 4° as 1).</p></div>

Pickering) for solutions of sulphuric acid (especially those containing more than 5 p.c.
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) within the limits of 0° and 30° (and even to 40°), the variation of the sp. gr. with
the temperature <i>t</i> may (within the accuracy of the existing determinations) be perfectly
expressed by the equation S<sub><i>t</i></sub> = S<sub><i>0</i></sub> + A<i>t</i> + B<i>t</i><sup>2</sup>. It must be added that (1) three specific
gravities fully determine the variation of the density with <i>t</i>; (2) <i>ds/dt</i> = A + 2B<i>t</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the
factor of the temperature is expressed by a straight line; (3) the value of A (if <i>p</i> be
greater than 5 p.c.) is negative, and numerically much greater than B; (4) the value of
B for dilute solutions containing less than 25 p.c. is negative; for solutions approximating
to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O in their composition it is equal to 0, and for solutions of greater concentration
B is positive; (5) the factor <i>ds/dp</i> for all temperatures attains a maximum
value about H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O; (6) on dividing <i>ds/dt</i> by S<sub><i>0</i></sub>, and so obtaining the coefficient of
expansion <i>k</i> (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_53_325">53</a>), a minimum is obtained near H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O, and a
maximum at H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O for all temperatures.</p></div>

this subject (1887) I admit their possibility, but only conditionally; and now, without

of two series of new determinations (Lunge and Pickering in 1890), which disagree in

determinations have not added to the accuracy of our data respecting the variation of
the specific gravity of solutions of sulphuric acid; (2) that the sum total of existing data
does not negative (within the limit of experimental accuracy) the possibility of a rectilinear

the factor <i>ds</i>/<i>dp</i> is in in way altered if, instead of a series of broken straight lines, there
be a continuous series of curves, nearly approaching straight lines; and (5) that this
subject deserves (as I mentioned in 1887) new and careful elaboration, because it concerns
that foremost problem in our science&mdash;solutions&mdash;and introduces a special method into it&mdash;that

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_BIS_332" id="Footnote_56_BIS_332"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_BIS_332"><span class="label">[56 bis]</span></a> These hydrates are: (<i>a</i>) H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = SO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O (melts at + 10°·4); (<i>b</i>) H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O
= SO<sub>3</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O (crystallo-hydrate, melts at +8°·5); (<i>c</i>) H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O (is apparently not
crystallisable); (<i>d</i>) one of the hydrates between H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O, most
probably H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O = SO<sub>3</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O, for it crystallises at -24°·5 (Note <a href="#Footnote_50_BIS_322">50 bis</a>); and (<i>e</i>) a
certain hydrate with a large proportion of water, about H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>150H<sub>2</sub>O. The existence
of the last is inferred from the fact that the factor <i>ds</i>/<i>dp</i> first falls, starting from water, and
then rises, and this change takes place when <i>p</i> is less than 5 p.c. Certainly a change in the
variation of <i>ds</i>/<i>dp</i> or <i>ds</i>/<i>dt</i> does take place in the neighbourhood of these five hydrates
(Pickering, 1890, recognised a far greater number of hydrates). I think it well to add
that if the composition of the solutions be expressed by the percentage amount of
molecules&mdash;<i>r</i><sub>1</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> + (100 - <i>r</i><sub>1</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>O we find that for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, <i>r</i><sub>1</sub> = 50, for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O <i>r</i><sub>1</sub>
= 25 = 50/2, for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, <i>r</i><sub>1</sub> = 33·333 = 50·&#8532;, while for H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O, <i>r</i><sub>1</sub> = 16·666 = 50·&#8531;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
that the chief hydrates are distributed symmetrically between H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Besides
which I may mention that my researches (1887) upon the abrupt changes in the factor
for solutions of sulphuric acid, and upon the correspondence of the breaks of <i>ds</i>/<i>dp</i> with
definite hydrates, received an indirect confirmation not only in the solutions of HNO<sub>3</sub>,
HCl, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O, &amp;c., which I investigated (in my work cited in Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_19_66">19</a>),
but also in the careful observations made by Professor Cheltzoff on the solutions of FeCl<sub>3</sub>
and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> (Chapter XVI., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_4_831">4</a>) which showed the existence in these solutions of
an almost similar change in <i>ds</i>/<i>dp</i> as is found in sulphuric acid. The detailed researches
(1893) made by Tourbaba on the solutions of many organic substances are of a similar
nature. Besides which, H. Crompton (1888), in his researches on the electrical conductivity
of solutions of sulphuric acid, and Tammann, in his observations on their
vapour tension, found a correlation with the hydrates indicated as above by the investigation
of their specific gravities. The influence of mixtures of a definite composition
upon the chemical relations of solutions is even exhibited in such a complex process as
electrolysis. V. Kouriloff (1891) showed that mixtures containing about 3 p.c., 47 p.c.
and 73 p.c. of sulphuric acid&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> whose composition approaches that of the hydrates
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>150H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;exhibit certain peculiarities in respect to
the amount of peroxide of hydrogen formed during electrolysis. Thus a 3 p.c. solution
gives a maximum amount of peroxide of hydrogen at the negative pole, as compared with
that given by other neighbouring concentrations. Starting from 3 p.c., the formation of
peroxide of hydrogen ceases until a concentration of 47 p.c. is reached.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_333" id="Footnote_57_333"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_333"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> Cellulose, for instance unsized paper or calico, is dissolved by strong sulphuric
acid. Acid diluted with about half its volume of water converts it (if the action be of
short duration) into vegetable parchment (Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_18_65">18</a>). The action of dilute
solutions of sulphuric acid converts it into hydro-cellulose, and the fibre loses its coherent
quality and becomes brittle. The prolonged action of strong sulphuric acid chars the
cellulose while dilute acid converts it into glucose. If sulphuric acid be kept in an open
vessel, the organic matter of the dust held in the atmosphere falls into it and blackens the
acid. The same thing happens if sulphuric acid be kept in a bottle closed by a cork; the
cork becomes charred, and the acid turns black. However, the chemical properties of
the acid undergo only a very slight change when it turns black. Sulphuric acid which is
considerably diluted with water does not produce the above effects, which clearly shows
their dependence on the affinity of the sulphuric acid for water. It is evident from the
preceding that strong sulphuric acid will act as a powerful poison; whilst, on the other
hand, when very dilute it is employed in certain medicines and as a fertiliser for plants.</p></div>

acid; the first group includes silver, mercury, copper, lead, and bismuth, which are only
acted upon by hot concentrated acid. In this case sulphurous anhydride is evolved
without any by-reactions. The second group contains manganese, nickel, cobalt, iron,
zinc, cadmium, aluminium, tin, thallium, and the alkali metals. They react with sulphuric
acid of any concentration at any temperature. At a low temperature hydrogen is
disengaged, and at higher temperatures (and with very concentrated acid) hydrogen and
sulphurous anhydride are simultaneously evolved.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_336" id="Footnote_59_336"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_336"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> For example, the action of hot sulphuric acid on nitrogenous compounds, as
applied in Kjeldahl's method for the estimation of nitrogen (Volume I. p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_249">249</a>). It is
obvious that when sulphuric acid acts as an oxidising agent it forms sulphurous anhydride.</p>

<p>The action of sulphuric acid on the alcohols is exactly similar to its action on
alkalis, because the alcohols, like alkalis, react on acids; a molecule of alcohol with a
molecule of sulphuric acid separates water and forms an <i>acid</i> ethereal salt&mdash;that is
there is produced an ethereal compound corresponding with acid salts. Thus, for
example, the action of sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, on ordinary alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, gives water
and sulphovinic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>HSO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;that is, sulphuric acid in which one atom of hydrogen
is replaced by the radicle C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> of ethyl alcohol, SO<sub>2</sub>(OH)(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), or, what is the same
thing, the hydrogen in alcohol is replaced by the radicle (sulphoxyl) of sulphuric acid,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O.SO<sub>2</sub>(OH).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_337" id="Footnote_60_337"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_337"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> We will mention the following difference between the sulphonic acids and the
ethereal acid sulphates (Note <a href="#Footnote_59_336">59</a>): the former re-form sulphuric acid with difficulty and
the latter easily. Thus sulphovinic acid when heated with an excess of water is reconverted
into alcohol and sulphuric acid. This is explained in the following manner. Both
these classes of acids are produced by the substitution of hydrogen by SO<sub>3</sub>H, or the
univalent radicle of sulphuric acid, but in the formation of ethereal acid sulphates the
SO<sub>3</sub>H replaces the hydrogen of the hydroxyl in the alcohol, whilst in the formation of
the sulphonic acids the SO<sub>3</sub>H replaces the hydrogen of a hydrocarbon. This difference
is clearly evidenced in the existence of two acids of the composition SO<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. The one,
mentioned above, is sulphovinic acid or alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.OH, in which the hydrogen of the
hydroxyl is replaced by sulphoxyl = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.OSO<sub>3</sub>H, whilst the other is alcohol, in which
one atom of the hydrogen in ethyl, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, is replaced by the sulphonic group&mdash;that is
= (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)SO<sub>3</sub>H·OH. The latter is called isethionic acid. It is more stable than sulphovinic
acid. The details as to these interesting compounds must be looked for in works on
organic chemistry, but I think it necessary to note one of the general methods of formation
of these acids. The sulphites of the alkalis&mdash;for example, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;when heated with the
halogen products of metalepsis, give a halogen salt and a salt of a sulphonic acid. Thus
methyl iodide, CH<sub>3</sub>I, derived from marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>, when heated to 100° with a solution
of potassium sulphite, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, gives potassium iodide, KI, and potassium methylsulphonate,
CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>K&mdash;that is a salt of the sulphonic acid. This shows that the sulphonic
acid may be referred to sulphurous acid, and that there is a resemblance between sulphuric
and sulphurous acid, which clearly reveals itself here in the formation of one
product from them both.</p></div>

barium peroxide be dissolved in hydrochloric (or acetic) acid, or if a solution of
hydrogen peroxide be diluted with a solution of barium hydroxide, a pure hydrate is precipitated
having the composition BaO<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O (sometimes the composition is taken as
BaO<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O). This fact was already known to Thénard. Schöne showed that if hydrogen
peroxide be in excess, a crystalline compound of the two peroxides, BaO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is precipitated.
Schöne also obtained small well-formed crystals of the same composition by
adding a solution of ammonia to an acid solution of barium peroxide (containing a barium
salt and hydrogen peroxide or a compound of BaO<sub>2</sub> with the acid). Thus barium
peroxide combines with both water and hydrogen peroxide. This is a very important fact
for the comprehension of the composition of other peroxides. Moreover, if the peroxides
are able to give hydrates they can also form corresponding salts, <i>i.e.</i> they can combine
with bases and acids, as was afterwards found to be the case on further research into this
subject.</p></div>

action of a silent discharge of considerable intensity on a mixture of oxygen and sulphurous
anhydride; the vapour of sulphuric peroxide, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, condenses as liquid drops,
or after being cooled to 0° in the form of long prismatic crystals, resembling those of
sulphuric anhydride. The anhydrous compound S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (and also the hydrated compound)
cannot be preserved long, as it splits up into oxygen and sulphuric anhydride. Direct
experiment shows that a mixture of equal volumes of sulphurous anhydride and oxygen
leaves a residue of a quarter of the oxygen taken, or half of the whole volume, which
indicates the formula S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. This substance is soluble in water, and it then gives a
hydrate, probably having the composition S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O = 2SHO<sub>4</sub>. This solution oxidises
the salts SnX<sub>2</sub>, potassium iodide, and others, which renders it possible to prove that the
solution actually contains one atom of oxygen capable of effecting oxidation to two molecules
of sulphuric anhydride.</p>

<p>In order to fully demonstrate the reality of a peroxide form for acids, it should
be mentioned that some years ago Brodie obtained the so-called <i>acetic peroxide</i>,
(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, by the action of barium peroxide on acetic anhydride, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>O. Its
corresponding hydrate is also known. This shows that true peroxides and their
hydrates, with reactions similar to those of hydrogen peroxide, are possible for acids.
A similar higher oxide has long been known for chromium, and Berthelot obtained a
like compound for nitric acid (Chapter VI., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_26_354">26</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_64_341" id="Footnote_64_341"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_341"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> When an acid of the strength H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O is taken, at first only the hydrate of
the sulphuric peroxide, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, is formed, but when the concentration at the positive
pole reaches H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O, a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and the hydrate of sulphuric
peroxide begins to be formed. A state of equilibrium is ultimately arrived at when
the amounts of these substances correspond to the proportion S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> : 2H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which,
as it were, answers to a new hydrate, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O. But its existence cannot be admitted
because the sulphuric peroxide can be easily distinguished from the hydrogen peroxide
in the solution owing to the fact that the former does not act on an acid solution of
potassium permanganate, whilst the hydrogen peroxide disengages both its own oxygen
and that of the permanganic acid, converting it into manganous oxide. Their common
property of liberating iodine from an acid solution of the potassium iodide enables the
sum of the active oxygen in them both to be determined.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_342" id="Footnote_65_342"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_342"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> If a solution of sulphuric acid which has been first subjected to electrolysis be
neutralised with potash or baryta, the salt which is formed begins to decompose
rapidly with the evolution of oxygen (Berthelot, 1890). On saturating with caustic
baryta, the solution of the salt formed may be separated from the sulphate of barium,
and then the composition of the resultant compound, BaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, may be determined from
the amount of oxygen disengaged. Marshall (1891) studied the formation of this class
of compounds more fully; he subjected a saturated solution of bisulphate of potassium
to electrolysis with a current of 3&ndash;3&frac12; ampères; before electrolysis dilute sulphuric acid
is added to the liquid surrounding the negative pole, and during electrolysis the solution
at the anode is cooled. The electrolysis is continued without interruption for two days,
and a white crystalline deposit separates at the anode. To avoid decomposition, the
latter is not filtered through paper, but through a perforated platinum plate, and dried
on a porous tile. The mother liquor, with the addition of a fresh solution of bisulphate
of potassium, is again subjected to electrolysis and the crystals formed at the anode are
again collected, &amp;c. The salt so obtained may be recrystallised by dissolving it in hot
water and rapidly cooling the solution after filtration; a small proportion of the salt is
decomposed by this treatment. Rapid cooling is followed by the formation of small
columnar crystals; slow cooling gives large prismatic crystals. The composition of the
salt is determined either by igniting it, when it forms sulphate of potassium, or else by
titrating the active oxygen with permanganate: its composition was found to correspond
to the salt of persulphuric acid, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. The solution of the salt has a neutral reaction,
and does not give a precipitate with salts of other metals. K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> is the most insoluble
of the salts of persulphuric acid. With nitrate of silver it forms persulphate of
silver, which gives peroxide of silver under the action of water according to the equation
Ag<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = Ag<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. With an alkaline solution of a cupric salt (Fehling's
solution) it forms a red precipitate of peroxide of copper. Manganese and cobalt salts
give precipitates of MnO<sub>2</sub> and Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Ferrous salts are rapidly oxidised, potassium
iodide slowly disengages iodine at the ordinary temperature. All these reactions indicate
the powerful oxidising properties of K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. In oxidising in the presence of water it gives
a residue of KHSO<sub>4</sub>. The decomposition of the dry salt begins at 100° but is not complete
even at 250°. The freshly prepared salt is inodorous, but after being kept in a
closed vessel it evolves a peculiar smell different from that of ozone. The ammonium
salt of persulphuric acid, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, is obtained in a similar manner. It is soluble to
the extent of 58 parts per 100 parts by weight of water. The decomposition of the
ammonium salt by the hydrated oxide of barium gives the barium salt, BaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O,
which is soluble to the extent of 52·2 parts in 100 parts of water at 0°. The crystals do not
deliquesce in the air and decompose in the course of several days; they decompose most
rapidly in perfectly dry air. Solutions of the pure salt decompose slowly at the ordinary
temperature; on boiling barium sulphate is gradually precipitated, oxygen being liberated
simultaneously. To completely decompose this salt it is necessary to boil its solution for a
long time. Alcohol dissolves the solid salt; the anhydrous salt does not separate from
the alcoholic solution, but a hydrate containing one molecule of water, BaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O,
which is soluble in water but insoluble in absolute alcohol. Solid barium persulphate
decomposes even when slightly heated. The free acid, which may serve for the preparation
of other salts, is obtained by treating the barium salt with sulphuric acid. The
lead salt, PbS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, has been obtained from the free acid; it crystallises with two or three
molecules of water. It is soluble in water, deliquesces in the air, and with alkalis gives
a precipitate of the hydrated oxide which rapidly oxidises into the binoxide.</p>

<p>Traube, before Marshall's researches, thought that the electrolysis of solutions of
sulphuric acid did not give persulphuric acid but a persulphuric oxide having the composition
SO<sub>4</sub>. On repeating his former researches (1892) Traube obtained a persulphuric
oxide by the electrolysis of a 70 per cent. solution of sulphuric acid, and he separated it
from the solution by means of barium phosphate. Analysis showed that this substance
corresponded to the above composition SO<sub>4</sub>, and therefore Traube considers it very
likely that the salts obtained by Marshall corresponded to an acid H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + SO<sub>4</sub>, <i>i.e.</i> that
the indifferent oxide, SO<sub>4</sub>, can combine with sulphuric acid and form peculiar saline
compounds.</p></div>

example of barium peroxide (Note <a href="#Footnote_62_339">62</a>), these peroxide forms will probably combine
together. It seems to me that the compounds obtained by Fairley for uranium are very
instructive as elucidating the peroxides. In the action of hydrogen peroxide in an acid
solution on uranium oxide, UO<sub>3</sub>, there is formed a uranium peroxide, UO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O (U = 240),
but hydrogen peroxide acts on uranium oxide in the presence of caustic soda; on the
addition of alcohol a crystalline compound containing Na<sub>4</sub>UO<sub>8</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O is precipitated,
which is doubtless a compound of the peroxides of sodium, Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and uranium, UO<sub>4</sub>.
It is very possible that the first peroxide, UO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, contains the elements of hydrogen
peroxide and uranium peroxide, U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, or even U(OH)<sub>6</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, just as the peroxide form
lately discovered by Spring for tin perhaps contains Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_67_345" id="Footnote_67_345"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_345"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> This view was communicated by me in 1870 to the Russian Chemical Society.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68_346" id="Footnote_68_346"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_346"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> <i>Dithionic acid</i>, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, is distinguished among the thionic acids as containing
the least proportion of sulphur. It is also called hyposulphuric acid, because its supposed
anhydride, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, contains more O than sulphurous oxide, SO<sub>2</sub> or S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and less than
sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub> or S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. Dithionic acid, discovered by Gay-Lussac and
Welter, is known as a hydrate and as salts, but not as anhydride. The method for preparing
dithionic acid usually employed is by the action of finely-powdered manganese
dioxide on a solution of sulphurous anhydride. On shaking, the smell of the latter
disappears, and the manganese salt of the acid in question passes into solution;
MnO<sub>2</sub> + 2SO<sub>2</sub> = MnS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. If the temperature be raised, the dithionate splits up into
sulphurous anhydride and manganese sulphate, MnSO<sub>4</sub>. Generally owing to this a
mixture of manganese sulphate and dithionate is obtained in the solution. They may
be separated by mixing the solution of the manganese salts with a solution of barium
hydroxide, when a precipitate of manganese hydroxide and barium sulphate is obtained.
In this manner barium dithionate only is obtained in solution. It is purified by
crystallisation, and separates as BaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O; this is then dissolved in water, and
decomposed with the requisite amount of sulphuric acid. Dithionic acid, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, then
remains in solution. By concentrating the resultant solution under the receiver of an
air-pump it is possible to obtain a liquid of sp. gr. 1·347, but it still contains water, and
on further evaporation the acid decomposes into sulphuric acid and sulphurous anhydride:
H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub>. The same decomposition takes place if the solution be
slightly heated. Like all the thionic acids, dithionic acid is readily attacked by oxidising
agents, and passes into sulphurous acid. No dithionate is able to withstand the action
of heat, even when very slight, without giving off sulphurous anhydride: K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
= K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub>. The alkali dithionates have a neutral reaction (which indicates the
energetic nature of the acid) are soluble in water, and in this respect present a certain
resemblance to the salts of nitric acid (their anhydrides are: N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>). Klüss
(1888) described many of the salts of dithionic acid.</p>

<p>Langlois, about 1840, obtained a peculiar thionic acid by heating a strong solution
of acid potassium sulphite with flowers of sulphur to about 60°, until the disappearance
of the yellow coloration first produced by the solution of the sulphur. On cooling, a
portion of the sulphur was precipitated, and crystals of a salt of <i>trithionic acid</i>,
K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (partly mixed with potassium sulphate), separated out. Plessy afterwards
showed that the action of sulphurous acid on a thiosulphate also gives sulphur and
trithionic acid: 2K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3SO<sub>2</sub> = 2K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + S. A mixture of potassium acid sulphite
and thiosulphate also gives a trithionate. It is very possible that a reaction of the
same kind occurs in the formation of trithionic acid by Langloid's method, because
potassium sulphite and sulphur yield potassium thiosulphate. The potassium thiosulphate
may also be replaced by potassium sulphide, and on passing sulphurous anhydride
through the solution thiosulphate is first formed and then trithionate: 4KHSO<sub>3</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>S
+ 4SO<sub>2</sub> = 3K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. The sodium salt is not formed under the same circumstances
as the corresponding potassium salt. The sodium salt does not crystallise and is very
unstable: the barium salt is, however, more stable. The barium and potassium salts
are anhydrous, they give neutral solutions and decompose when ignited, with the
evolution of sulphur and sulphurous anhydride, a sulphate being left behind, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
= K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + S. If a solution of the potassium salt be decomposed by means of
hydrofluosilicic or chloric acid, the insoluble salts of these acids are precipitated and
trithionic acid is obtained in solution, which however very easily breaks up on concentration.
The addition of salts of copper, mercury, silver, &amp;c., to a solution of a trithionate
is followed, either immediately or after a certain time, by the formation of a black precipitate
of the sulphides whose formation is due to the decomposition of the trithionic
acid with the transference of its sulphur to the metal.</p>

<p><i>Tetrathionic acid</i>, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, in contradistinction to the preceding acids, is much
more stable in the free state than in the form of salts. In the latter form it is easily
converted into trithionate, with liberation of sulphur. Sodium tetrathionate was
obtained by Fordos and Gélis, by the action of iodine on a solution of sodium thiosulphate.
The reaction essentially consists in the iodine taking up half the sodium of the
thiosulphate, inasmuch as the latter contains Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, whilst the tetrathionate contains
NaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, so that the reaction is as follows: 2Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> = 2NaI + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.
It is evident that tetrathionic acid stands to thiosulphuric acid in exactly the same
relation as dithionic acid does to sulphurous acid; for the same amount of the other
elements in dithionate, KSO<sub>3</sub>, and tetrathionate, KS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, there is half as much metal as
in sulphite, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, and thiosulphate, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. If in the above reaction the sodium
thiosulphate be replaced by the lead salt PbS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the sparingly-soluble lead iodide PbI<sub>2</sub>
and the soluble salt PbS<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> are obtained. Moreover the lead salt easily gives tetrathionic
acid itself (PbSO<sub>4</sub> is precipitated). The solution of tetrathionic acid may be
evaporated over a water-bath, and afterwards in a vacuum, when it gives a colourless
liquid, which has no smell and a very acid reaction. When dilute it may be heated to
its boiling-point, but in a concentrated form it decomposes into sulphuric acid, sulphurous
anhydride, and sulphur: H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + S<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p><i>Pentathionic acid</i>, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, also belongs to this series of acids. But little is known
concerning it, either as hydrate or in salts. It is formed, together with tetrathionic
acid, by the direct action of sulphurous acid on sulphuretted hydrogen in an aqueous
solution; a large proportion of sulphur being precipitated at the same time: 5SO<sub>2</sub>
+ 5H<sub>2</sub>S = H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 5S + 4H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>If, as was shown above, the thionic acids are disulphonic acids, they may be obtained,
like other sulphonic acids, by means of potassium sulphite and sulphur chloride.
Thus Spring demonstrated the formation of potassium trithionate by the action of sulphur
dichloride on a strong solution of potassium sulphite: 2KSO<sub>3</sub>K + SCl<sub>2</sub> = S(SO<sub>3</sub>K)<sub>2</sub>
+ 2KCl. If sulphur chloride be taken, sulphur also is precipitated. The same
trithionate is formed by heating a solution of double thiosulphates; for example, of
AgKS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Two molecules of the salts then form silver sulphide and potassium
trithionate. If the thiosulphate be the potassium silver salt SO<sub>3</sub>K(AgS), then the
structure of the trithionate must necessarily be (SO<sub>3</sub>K)<sub>2</sub>S. Previous to Spring's
researches, the action of iodine on sodium thiosulphate was an isolated accidentally
discovered reaction; he, however, showed its general significance by testing the action of
iodine on mixtures of different sulphur compounds. Thus with iodine, I<sub>2</sub>, the mixture
Na<sub>2</sub>S + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> forms 2NaI + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, whilst the mixture Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> gives
2NaI + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>&mdash;that is, trithionic acid stands in the same relation to thiosulphuric acid
as the latter does to sulphuretted hydrogen. We adopt the same mode of representation:
by replacing one hydrogen in H<sub>2</sub>S by sulphuryl we obtain thiosulphuric acid,
HSO<sub>3</sub>.HS, and by replacing a second hydrogen in the latter again by sulphuryl we obtain
trithionic acid, (HSO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S. Furthermore, Spring showed that the action of sodium
amalgam on the thionic acids causes reverse reactions to those above indicated for
iodine. Thus sodium thiosulphate with Na<sub>2</sub> gives Na<sub>2</sub>S + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, and Spring showed
that the sodium here is not a simple element taking up sulphur, but itself enters into
double decomposition, replacing sulphur; for on taking a potassium salt and acting on
it with sodium, KSO<sub>3</sub>(SK) + NaNa = KSO<sub>3</sub>Na + (SK)Na. In a similar way sodium
dithionate with sodium gives sodium sulphite: (NaSO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub> = 2NaSO<sub>3</sub>Na; sodium
trithionate forms NaSO<sub>3</sub>Na and NaSO<sub>3</sub>.SNa, and tetrathionate forms sodium thiosulphate,
(NaSO<sub>3</sub>)S<sub>2</sub>(NaSO<sub>3</sub>) + Na<sub>2</sub> = 2(NaSO<sub>3</sub>)(NaS).</p>

<p>In all the oxidised compounds of sulphur we may note the presence of the elements
of sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, the only product of the combustion of sulphur, and in this
sense the compounds of sulphur containing one SO<sub>2</sub> are&mdash;</p>

<p>Hence it is evident that SO<sub>2</sub> has (whilst CO<sub>2</sub> has not) the faculty for combination,
and aims at forming SO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>. These X<sub>2</sub> can = O, and the question naturally suggests
itself as to whether the O<sub>2</sub> which occurs in SO<sub>2</sub> is not of the same nature as this oxygen
which adds itself to SO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that is, whether SO<sub>2</sub> does not correspond with the more
general type SX<sub>4</sub>, and its compounds with the type SX<sub>6</sub>? To this we may answer &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;
and &lsquo;No&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Yes&rsquo; in the general sense which proceeds from the investigation of the
majority of compounds, especially metals, where RO corresponds with RCl<sub>2</sub>, RX<sub>2</sub>; &lsquo;No&rsquo;
in the sense that sulphur does not give either SH<sub>4</sub>, SH<sub>6</sub>, or SCl<sub>6</sub>, and therefore the
stages SX<sub>4</sub> and SX<sub>6</sub> are only observable in oxygen compounds. With reference to the
type SX<sub>6</sub> a hydrate, S(HO)<sub>6</sub>, might be expected, if not SCl<sub>6</sub>. And we must recognise
this hydrate from a study of the compounds of sulphuric acid with water. In
addition to what has been already said respecting the complex acids formed by sulphur,
I think it well to mention that, according to the above view, still more complex oxygen
acids and salts of sulphur may be looked for. For instance, the salt Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>8</sub> obtained
by Villiers (1888) is of this kind. It is formed together with sodium trithionate and
sulphur, when SO<sub>2</sub> is passed through a cold solution of Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which is then allowed
to stand for several days at the ordinary temperature: 2Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 4SO<sub>2</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>8</sub>
+ Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + S. It may be assumed here, as in the thionic acids, that there are two
sulphoxyls, bound together not only by S, but also by SO<sub>2</sub>, or what is almost the
same thing, that the sulphoxyl is combined with the residue of trithionic acid, <i>i.e.</i> replaces
one aqueous residue in trithionic acid.</p></div>

carbon; under the action of the sun's rays it is decomposed into sulphur and solid
substance which is considered to be carbon monosulphide; it is of a red colour, and its
sp. gr. is 1·66. (The formation of a red liquid compound C<sub>3</sub>S<sub>2</sub> has also been remarked.)
Thorpe (1889) observed a complete decomposition of carbon bisulphide under the action
of a liquid alloy of potassium and sodium; it is accompanied by an explosion and the
deposition of carbon and sulphur. A similar complete decomposition of carbon bisulphide
is also accomplished by the action of mercury fulminate (Chapter XVI., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_26_853">26</a>),
and is due to the fact that <i>at the ordinary temperature</i> (at which carbon bisulphide is
not produced) <i>the decomposition</i> of carbon bisulphide takes place with the development
of heat&mdash;that is, it presents an exothermal reaction, like the decomposition of all
explosives. It is very possible that at a higher temperature, when carbon bisulphide is
formed, the <i>combination</i> of carbon with sulphur is also an exothermal reaction&mdash;that is,
heat is developed. If this should be the case, carbon bisulphide would present a most
instructive example in thermochemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_70_348" id="Footnote_70_348"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_348"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> The fact should not be lost sight of that sulphur and charcoal are solids at the
ordinary temperature, whilst carbon bisulphide is a very volatile liquid, and consequently, in
the act of combination, referred to the ordinary temperature (Note <a href="#Footnote_69_347">69</a>), there is, as it were, a
passage into a liquid state, and this requires the absorption of heat. And furthermore,
the molecule of sulphur contains at least six atoms, and the molecule of carbon in all
probability (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_338">VIII.</a>) a very considerable number of atoms; thus the reaction of
sulphur on charcoal may be expressed in the following manner: 3C<sub><i>n</i></sub> + <i>n</i>S<sub>6</sub> = 3<i>n</i>CS<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that
is, from <i>n</i> + 3 molecules there proceed 3<i>n</i> molecules, and as <i>n</i> must be very considerable,
3<i>n</i> must be greater than 3 + <i>n</i>, which indicates a decomposition in the
formation of carbon bisulphide, although the reaction at first sight appears as one of
combination. This decomposition is seen also from the volumes in the solid and liquid
states. Carbon bisulphide has a sp. gr. of 1·29; hence its molecular volume is 59. But
the volume of carbon, even in the form of charcoal, is not more than 6, and the volume
of S<sub>2</sub> is 30; hence 36 volumes after combination give 59 volumes&mdash;an expansion takes
place, as in decompositions.</p></div>

contains not only sulphur, but, more especially, other impurities which give it a very
disagreeable odour. The best method of purifying this malodorous carbon bisulphide is
to shake it up with a certain amount of mercuric chloride, or even simply with mercury,
until the surface of the metal ceases to turn black. After this the carbon bisulphide
must be poured off and distilled over a water-bath, after mixing with some oil to retain
the impurities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_72_350" id="Footnote_72_350"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_350"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> If carbon bisulphide be evaporated under the receiver of an air-pump, or by means
of a current of air, it is possible to obtain a temperature as low as -60°, and the carbon
bisulphide does not solidify at this temperature. However, if a series of air-bubbles be
passed through it by means of bellows, a crystalline white substance remains which
volatilises below 0°: this a hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>O,2CS<sub>2</sub>; it easily decomposes into water and
carbon bisulphide. It is formed in the above experiment by the moisture held in the
air passed through the carbon bisulphide, and the fall of temperature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73_351" id="Footnote_73_351"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_351"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> Strong alcohol is miscible in all proportions with carbon bisulphide, but dilute
alcohol only in a definite amount, owing to its diminished solubility from the presence of
the water in it. Ether, hydrocarbons, fatty oils, and many other organic substances are
soluble with great ease in carbon bisulphide. This is taken advantage of in practice for
extracting the fatty oils from vegetable seeds, such as linseed, palm-nuts, or from bones, &amp;c.
The preparation of vegetable oils is usually done by pressing the seeds under a press,
but the residue always contains a certain amount of oil. These traces of oil can,
however, be removed by treatment with carbon bisulphide. In this manner a solution
is obtained which when heated easily parts with all the carbon bisulphide, leaving the
non-volatile fatty oil behind, so that the same carbon bisulphide may be condensed and
used over again for the same purpose. It also dissolves iodine, bromine, indiarubber,
sulphur, and tars.</p>

<p>Carbon bisulphide, especially at high temperatures, very often acts by its elements
in a manner in which carbon and sulphur alone are not able to react, which will be
understood from what has been said above respecting its endothermal origin. If it be
passed over red-hot metals&mdash;even over copper, for instance, not to mention sodium, &amp;c.&mdash;it
forms a sulphide of the metal and deposits charcoal, and if the vapour be passed over
incandescent metallic oxides it forms metallic sulphides and carbonic anhydride (and
sometimes a certain amount of sulphurous anhydride). Lime and similar oxides give
under these circumstances a carbonate and a sulphide&mdash;for example, CS<sub>2</sub> +3CaO = 2CaS
+ CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The sulphides obtained by this means are often well crystallised, like those
found in nature&mdash;for example, lead and antimony sulphides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73_BIS_352" id="Footnote_73_BIS_352"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_BIS_352"><span class="label">[73 bis]</span></a> And just as COCl<sub>2</sub> corresponds to CO<sub>2</sub>, so also the chloranhydride, CSCl<sub>2</sub>, or
<i>thiophosgene</i>, corresponds to CS<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_74_353" id="Footnote_74_353"></a><a href="#FNanchor_74_353"><span class="label">[74]</span></a> If instead of a sulphide we take an alkali hydroxide, a thiocarbonate is also
formed, together with a carbonate&mdash;thus, 3BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 3CS<sub>2</sub> = 2BaCS<sub>3</sub> + BaCO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O.
From the instability of the thiocarbonates of the alkaline metals we can clearly
see the reason of the difficulty with which the salts of the heavier metals are formed,
whose basic properties are incomparably weaker than those of the alkali metals. However,
these salts may be obtained by double decomposition. Ammonia in reacting on
carbon bisulphide gives, besides products like those formed by other alkalis, a whole
series of products of as complex a structure as those substances which are produced by
the action of carbonic anhydride on ammonia. In the ninth chapter we examined the
formation of the ammonium carbonates, and saw the transition from them into the
cyanides. It is not surprising after this that the action of carbon bisulphide on
ammonia not only produces the above-mentioned salts, but also amidic compounds
corresponding with them, in which the oxygen is wholly or partially replaced by sulphur.
Thus ammonium dithiocarbamate is very easily obtained if carbon bisulphide be added to
an alcoholic solution of ammonia, and the mixture cooled in a closed vessel. The salt
then separates out in minute yellow crystals, CN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>S<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Carbon bisulphide not only forms compounds with the metallic sulphides, but also
with sulphuretted hydrogen&mdash;that is, it forms <i>thiocarbonic acid</i>, H<sub>2</sub>CS<sub>3</sub>. This is
obtained by carefully mixing solutions of thiocarbonates with dilute hydrochloric acid.
It then separates in an oily layer, which easily decomposes in the presence of water into
sulphuretted hydrogen and carbon bisulphide, just as the corresponding carbonic acid
(hydrate) decomposes into water and carbonic anhydride. Carbon bisulphide combines
not only with sodium sulphide, but also with the bisulphide, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, not, however, with
the trisulphide, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The relation of carbon bisulphide to the other carbon compounds presents many
most interesting features which are considered in organic chemistry. We will here
only turn our attention to one of the compounds of this class. Ethyl sulphide, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S,
combines with ethyl iodide, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I, forming a new molecule, S(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>I. If we designate
the hydrocarbon group, for instance ethyl, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, by Et, the reaction would be
expressed by the following equation : Et<sub>2</sub>S + EtI = SEt<sub>3</sub>I. This compound is of a saline
character, corresponds with salts of the alkalis, and is closely analogous to ammonium
chloride. It is soluble in water; when heated it again splits up into its components
EtI and Et<sub>2</sub>S, and with silver hydroxide gives a hydroxide, Et<sub>3</sub>S·OH, having the
property of a distinct and energetic alkali, resembling caustic ammonia. Thus the
compound group SEt<sub>3</sub> combines, like potassium or ammonium, with iodine, hydroxyl,
chlorine, &amp;c. The hydroxide SEt<sub>3</sub>·OH is soluble in water, precipitates metallic salts,
saturates acids, &amp;c. Hence sulphur here enters into a relation towards other elements
similar to that of nitrogen in ammonia and ammonium salts, with only this difference,
that nitrogen retains, besides iodine, hydroxyl, and other groups, also H<sub>4</sub> or Et<sub>4</sub> (for
example, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, NEt<sub>3</sub>HI, NEt<sub>4</sub>I), whilst sulphur only retains Et<sub>3</sub>. Compounds of the
formula SH<sub>3</sub>X are however unknown, only the products of substitution SEt<sub>3</sub>X, &amp;c. are
known. The distinctly alkaline properties of the hydroxide, triethylsulphine hydroxide,
SEt<sub>3</sub>OH, and also the sharply-defined properties of the corresponding hydroxide,
tetraethylammonium hydroxide, NEt<sub>4</sub>OH, depend naturally not only on the properties
of the nitrogen and sulphur entering into their composition, but also on the large proportion
of hydrocarbon groups they contain. Judging from the existence of the ethylsulphine
compounds, it might be imagined that sulphur forms a compound, SH<sub>4</sub>, with
hydrogen; but no such compound is known, just as NH<sub>5</sub> is unknown, although NH<sub>4</sub>Cl
exists.</p></div>

or monothiocarbonic anhydride COS. This substance was obtained by Than, and is
formed in many reactions. A certain amount is obtained if a mixture of carbonic oxide
and the vapour of sulphur be passed through a red-hot tube. When carbon tetrachloride
is heated with sulphurous anhydride, this substance is also formed; but it is best obtained
in a pure form by decomposing potassium thiocyanate with a mixture of equal volumes
of water and sulphuric acid. A gas is then evolved containing a certain amount of
hydrocyanic acid, from which it may be freed by passing it over wool containing
moistened mercuric oxide, which retains the hydrocyanic acid. The reaction is expressed
by the equation: 2KCNS + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2COS. It is also
formed by passing the vapour of carbon bisulphide over alumina or clay heated to
redness (Gautier; silicon sulphide is then formed). COS is also formed by passing
phosgene over a long layer of asbestos mixed with cadmium sulphide at 270°; CdS + COCl<sub>3</sub>
= CdCl<sub>2</sub> + COS (Nuricsán, 1892). The pure gas has an aromatic odour, is soluble in an
equal volume of water, which, however, acts on it, so that it must be collected over
mercury. When slightly heated, carbon oxysulphide decomposes into sulphur and
carbonic oxide. It burns in air with a pale blue flame, explodes with oxygen, and yields
potassium sulphide and carbonate with potassium hydroxide: COS + 4KHO = K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
+ K<sub>2</sub>S + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_76_357" id="Footnote_76_357"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_357"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> There is no reason for seeing any contradiction or mutual incompatibility in these
three views, because every analogy is more or less modified by a change of elements.
Thus, for instance, it cannot be expected that the product of the metalepsis of hydrogen
sulphide would resemble the corresponding products of water in all respects, because
water has not the acid properties of hydrogen sulphide. In the days of dualism and
electrical polarity it was supposed that the sulphur varied in its nature: in hydrogen
sulphide or potassium sulphide it was considered to be negative, and in sulphurous
anhydride or sulphur dichloride positive. It then appeared evident that sulphur
dichloride would have no point of analogy with potassium sulphide. But metalepsis, or
its expression in the law of substitution, necessitates such opinions being laid aside. If
we can compare CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, CCl<sub>4</sub>, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>(OH) with each other, we cannot recognise
any difference in the sulphur in SH<sub>2</sub>, SCl<sub>2</sub>, SK<sub>2</sub>, or in general SX<sub>2</sub>, for otherwise we
should have to acknowledge as many different states of sulphur, carbon, or hydrogen as
there are compounds of sulphur, carbon, or hydrogen. The essential truth of the matter
is that all the elements in a molecule play their part in the reactions into which it enters.
Often this appears to be contradicted in the result&mdash;for example, hydrogen alone may
be replaced; but it is not this hydrogen alone that has determined the reaction; all
the elements present have participated in it. This may be made clearer by the
following rough illustration. Supposing two regiments of soldiers were fighting against
each other, and that several men were lost by one of the regiments; no one could say that
it was only these men who took part in the engagement. The other men fired and the
bullets flew over the heads of their opponents. It was not only those who fell who
fought, although they only were removed from the field of battle; the fighting proceeded
among the masses, but only those few were disabled who went forward and were more
conspicuous &amp;c.; not that the remainder did not take part in the action; they also
fought and were an object of attack, only they remained sound and unhurt. Hydrogen
is lighter than other elements and its atoms more mobile; it subjects itself more frequently
and easily to reactions; but it is not it alone which reacts, it is even less liable to attack
than other elements. It participates in exceedingly diverse reactions, not indeed because
the hydrogen itself varies, but because one atom of it puts itself forward, another is
hidden, one is united with carbon, another feebly held by sulphur, one stands or moves
in the neighbourhood of oxygen, another is joined to a hydrocarbon. All hydrogen atoms
are equal, and equally serve as an object of attack for the atoms of molecules encountering
them, but those only are removed from the sphere of action which are nearer the surface of
a molecule, which are more mobile, or held by a less sum of forces. So also sulphur is
one and the same in sulphur dichloride, in sulphurous or sulphuric anhydride, in
hydrogen sulphide, in potassium sulphide, but it reacts differently, and those elements
which are with it also vary in their reactions because they are with it, and it varies its
reactions because it is with them. It is possible to seize on a character common to
substances quantitatively and qualitatively analogous to each other. It may be admitted
that an element in certain forms is not able to enter into reactions into which in other
forms it enters willingly, if only the requisite conditions are encountered; but it must
not therefore be concluded that an element changes its essential quality in these
different cases. The preceding remarks touch on questions which are subject to much
argument among chemists, and I mention them here in order to show the treatment of
those most important problems of chemistry which lie at the basis of this treatise.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_77_358" id="Footnote_77_358"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_358"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> The observed vapour density of sulphur dichloride referred to hydrogen is 53·3,
and that given by the formula is 51·5. The smaller molecular weight explains its boiling
point being lower than that of sulphur chloride, S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The reactions of both these
compounds are very similar. Sulphur converts the dichloride, SCl<sub>2</sub>, into the monochloride,
S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. In one point the dichloride differs distinctly from the monochloride&mdash;that
is, in its capacity for easily giving up chlorine and decomposing. Even light decomposes
it into chlorine and the monochloride. Hence it acts on many substances in
the same manner as chlorine, or substances which easily part with the latter, such as
phosphoric or antimonic chloride. In distinction to these, however, sulphur dichloride
would appear to distil without any considerable decomposition, judging by the vapour
density. But this is not a valid conclusion, for if there be a decomposition, then
2SCl<sub>2</sub> = S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>; now the density of sulphur chloride = 67·5, and of chlorine = 35·5,
and consequently a mixture of equal volumes of the two = 51·5, just the same as an
equal volume of sulphur dichloride. <i>Therefore the distillation of sulphur dichloride
is probably nothing but its decomposition.</i> Hence the compound SCl<sub>2</sub>, which is stable
at the ordinary temperature, decomposes at 64°. In the cold it absorbs a further amount
of chlorine, corresponding to SCl<sub>4</sub>, but even at -10° a portion of the absorbed chlorine
is given off&mdash;that is, dissociation takes place. Thus the tetrachloride is even less stable
than the dichloride.</p></div>

<p>The acids of sulphur naturally have their corresponding ammonium salts, and the
latter their amides and nitriles. It will be readily understood how vast a field for
research is presented by the series of compounds of sulphur and nitrogen, if we only remember
that to carbonic and formic acids there corresponds, as we saw (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_379">IX.</a>), a
vast series of derivatives corresponding with their ammonium salts. To sulphuric acid
there correspond two ammonium salts, SO<sub>2</sub>(HO)(NH<sub>4</sub>O) and SO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>; three
amides: the acid amide SO<sub>2</sub>(HO)(NH<sub>2</sub>), or sulphamic acid, the normal saline compound
SO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>O)(NH<sub>2</sub>), or ammonium sulphamate, and the normal amide SO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, or sulphamide
(the analogue of urea); then the acid nitrile, SON(HO), and two neutral
nitriles, SON(NH<sub>2</sub>) and SN<sub>2</sub>. There are similar compounds corresponding with sulphurous
acid, and therefore its nitriles will be, an acid, SN(HO), its salt, and the normal
compound, SN(NH<sub>2</sub>). Dithionic and the other acids of sulphur should also have their
corresponding amides and nitriles. Only a few examples are known, which we will
briefly describe. Sulphuric acid forms salts of very great stability with ammonia, and
ammonium sulphate is one of the commonest ammoniacal compounds. It is obtained
by the direct action of ammonia on sulphuric acid, or by the action of the latter on
ammonium carbonate; it separates from its solutions in an anhydrous state, like
potassium sulphate, with which it is isomorphous. Hence, the composition of crystals
of ammonium sulphate is (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. This salt fuses at 140°, and does not undergo
any change when heated up to 180°. At higher temperatures it does not lose water, but
parts with half its ammonia, and is converted into the acid salt, HNH<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; and this
acid salt, on further heating, undergoes a further decomposition, and splits up into
nitrogen, water, and acid ammonium sulphite, HNH<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>. At the ordinary temperature
the normal salt is soluble in twice its weight of water and at the boiling-point of water in
an equal weight. In its faculty for combinations this salt exhibits a great resemblance
to potassium sulphate, and, like it, easily forms a number of double salts; the most
remarkable of which are the ammonia alums, NH<sub>4</sub>AlS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, and the double salts
formed by the metals of the magnesium group, having, for example, the composition
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>MgS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O. Ammonium sulphate does not give an amide when heated,
perhaps owing to the faculty of sulphuric anhydride to retain the water combined with
it with great force. But the amides of sulphuric acid may be very conveniently prepared
from sulphuric anhydride. Their formation by this method is very easily understood
because an amide is equal to an ammonium salt less water, and if the anhydride be
taken it will give an amide directly with ammonia. Thus, if dry ammonia be passed into
a vessel surrounded by a freezing mixture and containing sulphuric anhydride, it forms
a white powdery mass called sulphatammon, having the composition SO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>3</sub>N, and resembling
the similar compound of carbonic acid, CO<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>. This substance is naturally the
ammonium salt of sulphamic acid, SO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>O)NH<sub>2</sub>. It is slowly acted on by water, and
may therefore be obtained in solution, in which it slowly reacts with barium chloride,
which proves that with water it still forms ammonium sulphate. If this substance be
carefully dissolved in water and evaporated, it yields well-formed crystals, whose solution
no longer gives a precipitate with barium chloride. This is not due to the presence
of impurities, but to a change in the nature of the substance, and therefore Rose calls
the crystalline modification <i>parasulphatammon</i>. Platinum chloride only precipitates
half the nitrogen as platinochloride from solutions of sulphat- and parasulphatammon,
which shows that they are ammonium salts, SO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>O)(NH<sub>2</sub>). It may be that the
reason of the difference in the two modifications is connected with the fact that two
different substances of the composition N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> are possible: one is the amide
SO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> corresponding with the normal salt, and the other is the salt of the nitrile
acid corresponding with acid ammonium sulphate&mdash;that is, SON(ONH<sub>4</sub>) corresponds
with the acid SON(OH) = SO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>O)OH - 2H<sub>2</sub>O. Hence there may here be a difference
of the same nature as between urea and ammonium cyanate. Up to the present, the
isomerism indicated above has been but little investigated, and might be the subject of
interesting researches.</p>

<p>If in the preceding experiment the ammonia, and not the sulphuric anhydride, be
taken in excess, a soluble substance of the composition 2SO<sub>2</sub>,3NH<sub>3</sub> is formed. This
compound, obtained by Jacqueline and investigated by Voronin, doubtless also contains
a salt of sulphamic acid&mdash;that is, of the amide corresponding with the acid ammonium
sulphate = HNH<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O = (NH<sub>2</sub>)SO<sub>2</sub>(OH). Probably it is a compound of sulphatammon
with sulphamic acid. Thus it has an acid reaction, and does not give a precipitate
with barium chloride.</p>

<p>With normal sulphate of ammonium, an amide of the composition N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> should
correspond, which should bear the same relation to sulphuric acid as urea bears to carbonic
acid. This amide, known as <i>sulphamide</i>, is obtained by the action of dry ammonia
on the sulphuryl chloride, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, just as urea is obtained by the action of ammonia on
carbonyl chloride, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 4NH<sub>3</sub> = N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>2</sub> + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. The ammonium chloride is
separated from the resultant sulphamide with great difficulty. Cold water, acting on the
mixture, dissolves them both; the cold solution does not gives precipitate with barium
chloride. Alkalis act on it slowly, as they do on urea; but on boiling, especially in the
presence of alkalis or acids, it easily recombines with water, and gives an ammonium
salt.  V. Traube (1892) obtained sulphamide by the reaction of sulphuryl, dissolved in
chloroform, upon ammonia. The resultant precipitate dissolves when shaken up with
water, and the solution (after boiling with the oxides or lead or silver) is evaporated,
when a syrupy liquid remains. With nitrate of silver the latter gives a solid compound,
which, when decomposed by hydrochloric acid, gives free sulphamide in large colourless
crystals, having the composition SO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. This substance fuses at 81°, begins to
decompose below 100°, and is entirely decomposed above 250°; it is soluble in water,
and the solution has a neutral reaction and bitter taste.  When heated with acids,
sulphamide gradually decomposes, forming sulphuric acid and ammonia. If the silver
compound obtained by the action of sulphamide on nitrate of silver be heated at 170°-180°
until ammonia is no longer evolved, and the residue be extracted with water acidulated
with nitric acid, a salt separates out from the solution, answering in its composition to
sulphamide, SO<sub>2</sub>NAg, which = the amide - NH<sub>3</sub> = SO<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> - NH<sub>3</sub> = SO<sub>2</sub>NH. The action
of sulphuryl chloride (and of the other chloranhydrides of sulphur) on ammonium carbonate
always, as Mente showed (1888), results in the formation of the salt NH(SO<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The nitriles corresponding with sulphuric acid are not as yet known with any certainty.
The most simple nitrile corresponding with sulphuric acid should have the
composition N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>8</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> - 4H<sub>2</sub>O = N<sub>2</sub>S. This would be a kind of cyanogen corresponding
with sulphuric acid. On comparing sulphurous acid with carbonic acid, we saw that
they present a great analogy in many respects, and therefore it might be expected that
nitrile compounds having the composition NHS and N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> would be found. The
latter of these compounds is well known, and was obtained by Soubeiron, by the action
of dry ammonia on sulphur chloride. This substance corresponds with cyanogen
(paracyanogen), and is known as <i>nitrogen sulphide</i>, N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>. It is formed according to
the equation 3SCl<sub>2</sub> + 8NH<sub>3</sub> = N<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> + S + 6NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. The free sulphur and nitrogen sulphide
are dissolved by acting on the product with carbon bisulphide, the nitrogen
sulphide being much less soluble than the sulphur. It is a yellow substance, which is
excessively irritating to the eyes and nostrils. It explodes when rubbed with a hard
substance, being naturally decomposed with the evolution of nitrogen; but when heated
it fuses without decomposing, and only decomposes with explosion at 157°. It is
insoluble in water, and only slightly so in alcohol, ether, and carbon bisulphide; 100 parts
of the latter dissolve 1·5 part of nitrogen sulphide at the boiling point. This solution
on cooling deposits it in minute transparent prisms of a golden yellow colour.</p></div>

in water. It is best procured by the action of nitric acid on selenium. The well-known
researches of Nilson (1874) showed that the salts of selenious acid easily form acid salts,
and are so characteristic in many respects that they may even serve for judging the
analogy of types of oxides. Thus the oxides of the composition RO give normal salts
of the composition RSeO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, where R = Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn. The salts of magnesium,
barium, and calcium contain a different quantity of water, as do also the salts of the
oxides R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. We here turn attention to the fact that beryllium gives a normal salt,
BeSeO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and not a salt analogous to those of aluminium, scandium, Sc<sub>2</sub>(SeO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,
yttrium, Y<sub>2</sub>(SeO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, and other oxides of the form R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which speaks in favour of
the formula BeO.</p>

<p><i>Tellurous anhydride</i> is also a colourless solid, which crystallises in octahedra; it also,
when heated, first fuses and then volatilises. It is insoluble in water, and the decomposition
of its salts gives a hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>, which is insoluble.</p>

<p>It is a very characteristic circumstance that selenious and tellurous anhydrides
are very easily <i>reduced</i> to selenium and tellurium. This is not only effected by metals
like zinc, or by sulphuretted hydrogen, which are powerful deoxidisers, but even by sulphurous
anhydride, which is able to precipitate selenium and tellurium from solutions
of the selenites and tellurites, and even of the acids themselves, which is taken advantage
of in obtaining these elements and separating them from sulphur.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid, as we know, rarely acts as an oxidising agent. It is otherwise with
selenic and telluric acids, H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>4</sub>, which are powerful oxidising agents&mdash;that
is, are easily reduced in many circumstances either into the lower oxide or even to selenium
and tellurium. A powerful oxidising agent is required in order to convert selenious and
tellurous anhydrides into selenic and telluric anhydrides, and, moreover, it must be employed
in excess. If chlorine be passed through a solution of potassium selenide, K<sub>2</sub>Se, telluride,
K<sub>2</sub>Te, selenite, K<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, or tellurite, K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>3</sub>, it acts as an oxidiser in the presence of
the water, forming potassium selenate, K<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub>, or tellurate, K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>4</sub>. The same salts are
formed by fusing the lower oxides with nitre. These salts are isomorphous with the
corresponding sulphates, and cannot therefore be separated from them by crystallisation.
The salts of potassium, sodium, magnesium, copper, cadmium, &amp;c. are soluble like the
sulphates, but those of barium and calcium are insoluble, in perfect analogy with the sulphates.
When copper selenate, CuSeO<sub>4</sub>, is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen (CuS
is precipitated), <i>selenic acid</i> remains in solution. On evaporation and drying in vacuo
at 180° it gives a syrupy liquid, which may be concentrated to almost the pure acid,
H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub>, having a specific gravity of 2·6. Cameron and Macallan (1891) showed that pure
H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> only remains liquid in a state of superfusion whilst the solidified acid melts at
+58°, the solid acid crystallises well, its sp. gr. is then 2·95. The hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O
melts at +25°. The acid in a superfused state has a sp. gr. 2·36 and the solid 2·63.
Like sulphuric acid strong selenic acid attracts moisture from the atmosphere; it is not
decomposed by sulphurous acid, but oxidises hydrochloric acid (like nitric, chromic,
and manganic acids), evolving chlorine and forming selenious acid, H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>4</sub> + 2HCl
= H<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>. <i>Telluric acid</i>, H<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>4</sub>, is obtained by fusing tellurous anhydride
with potassium hydroxide and chlorate; the solution, containing potassium tellurate,
is then precipitated with barium chloride, and the barium tellurate, BaTeO<sub>4</sub> obtained
in the precipitate is decomposed by sulphuric acid. A solution of telluric acid
is thus obtained, which on evaporation yields colourless prisms, soluble in water, and
containing TeH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. Two equivalents of water are driven off at 160°; on further
heating the last equivalent of water is expelled, and then oxygen is given off. It
also gives chlorine with hydrochloric acid, like selenic acid. Its salts also correspond
with those of sulphuric acid. It must, however, be remarked that telluric and selenic
acids are able to give poly-acid salts with much greater ease than sulphuric acid. Thus,
for example, there are known for telluric acid not only K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O and KHTeO<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O,
but also KHTeO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O = K<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>TeO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. This salt is easily obtained
from acid solutions of the preceding salts and is less soluble in water. As selenious anhydride
is volatile and gives similar poly-salts, it may be surmised that selenious, tellurous,
selenic, and telluric anhydrides are polymeric as compared with sulphurous and sulphuric
anhydrides, for which reason it would be desirable to determine the vapour density of
selenious anhydride. It would probably correspond with Se<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or Se<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>In order to show the very close analogy of selenium to sulphur, I will quote two
examples. Potassium cyanide dissolves selenium, as it does sulphur, forming potassium
selenocyanate, KCNSe, corresponding with potassium thiocyanate. Acids precipitate
selenium from this solution, because selenocyanic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CNSe, when in a free state is
immediately decomposed. A boiling solution of sodium sulphite dissolves selenium,
just as it would sulphur, forming a salt analogous to thiosulphate of sodium, namely,
sodium selenosulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>SSeO<sub>3</sub>. Selenium is separated from a solution of this salt by
the action of acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_BIS_362" id="Footnote_79_BIS_362"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_BIS_362"><span class="label">[79 bis]</span></a> Muthmann, in his researches upon the allotropic forms of selenium, pointed out
(1889) a peculiar modification, which appears, as it were, as a transition between
crystalline and amorphous selenium. It is obtained together with the crystalline variety
by slowly evaporating a solution of selenium in bisulphide of carbon, and differs from
the crystalline variety in the form of its crystals; it passes into the latter modification
when heated. Schultz also obtained selenium (like Ag, <i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_398">XXIV</a>.) in a soluble
form, but these researches are not so conclusive as those upon soluble silver, and we
shall therefore not consider them more fully.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_80_363" id="Footnote_80_363"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_363"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> The tellurium thus prepared is impure, and contains a large amount of selenium.
The latter may be removed by converting the mixture into the salts of potassium, and
treating this with nitric acid and barium nitrate, when barium selenate only is precipitated,
whilst the barium tellurate remains in solution. This method does not, however, give a
pure product, and it appears to be best to separate the selenium from the tellurium in a
metallic form; this is done by boiling the impure potassium tellurate with hydrochloric
acid, which converts it into potassium tellurite, from which the tellurium is reduced by
sulphurous anhydride. The metal thus obtained is then fused and distilled in a stream
of hydrogen; the selenium volatilises first, and then the tellurium, owing to its being
much less volatile than the former. Nevertheless, tellurium is also volatile, and may be
separated in this manner from less volatile metals, such as antimony. Brauner determined
the atomic weight of pure tellurium, and found it to be 125, but showed (1889)
that tellurium purified by the usual method, even after distillation, contains a large
amount of impurities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_81_364" id="Footnote_81_364"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_364"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> The decomposition proceeds in the above order in the cold, but in a hot solution
with an excess of potassium hydroxide it proceeds inversely. A similar phenomenon
takes place when tellurium is fused with alkalis, and it is therefore necessary in order to
obtain potassium telluride to add charcoal.</p>

<p>Selenium and tellurium form higher compounds with chlorine with comparative
ease. For selenium, SeCl<sub>2</sub> and SeCl<sub>4</sub> are known, and for tellurium TeCl<sub>2</sub> and TeCl<sub>4</sub>.
The tetrachlorides of selenium and tellurium are formed by passing chlorine over these
elements. Selenium tetrachloride, SeCl<sub>4</sub>, is a crystalline, volatile mass which gives
selenious anhydride and hydrochloric acid with water. Tellurium tetrachloride is much
less volatile, fuses easily, and is also decomposed by water. Both elements form similar
compounds with bromine. Tellurium tetrabromide is red, fuses to a brown liquid,
volatilises, and gives a crystalline salt, K<sub>2</sub>TeBr<sub>6</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, with an aqueous solution of
potassium bromide.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">CHROMIUM, MOLYBDENUM, TUNGSTEN, URANIUM, AND MANGANESE</span></h2>

<p>Sulphur, selenium, and tellurium belong to the uneven series of the
sixth group. In the even series of this group there are known <i>chromium,
molybdenum, tungsten, and uranium</i>; these give acid oxides
of the type RO<sub>3</sub>, like SO<sub>3</sub>. Their acid properties are less sharply
defined than those of sulphur, selenium, and tellurium, as is the case
with all elements of the even series as compared with those of the
uneven series in the same group. But still the oxides CrO<sub>3</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>,
WO<sub>3</sub>, and even UO<sub>3</sub>, have clearly defined acid properties, and form
salts of the composition MO,<i>n</i>RO<sub>3</sub> with bases MO. In the case of the
heavy elements, and especially of uranium, the type of oxide, UO<sub>3</sub>,
is less acid and more basic, because in the even series of oxides the
element with the highest atomic weight always acquires a more and
more pronounced basic character. Hence UO<sub>3</sub> shows the properties of
a base, and gives salts UO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>. The basic properties of chromium,
molybdenum, tungsten, and uranium are most clearly expressed in the
lower oxides, which they all form. Thus chromic oxide, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is as
distinct a base as alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Of all these elements <i>chromium</i> is the most widely distributed
and the most frequently used. It gives chromic anhydride, CrO<sub>3</sub>, and
chromic oxide, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;two compounds whose relative amounts of
oxygen stand in the ratio 2 : 1. Chromium is, although somewhat
rarely, met with in nature as a compound of one or the other type.
The red chromium ore of the Urals, lead chromate or crocoisite
PbCrO<sub>4</sub>, was the source in which chromium was discovered by
Vauquelin, who gave it this name (from the Greek word signifying
colour) owing to the brilliant colours of its compounds; the chromates
(salts of chromic anhydride) are red and yellow, and the chromic salts
(from Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) green and violet. The red lead chromate is, however, a
rare chromium ore found only in the Urals and in a few other localities.
Chromic oxide, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is more frequently met with. In small quantities
it forms the colouring matter of many minerals and rocks&mdash;for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
of some serpentines. The commonest ore, and the chief source of the
chromium compounds, is the <i>chrome iron ore</i> or chromite, which occurs
in the Urals<a name="FNanchor_1_365" id="FNanchor_1_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_365" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Asia Minor, California, Australia, and other
localities. This is magnetic iron ore, FeO,Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in which the ferric
oxide is replaced by chromic oxide, its composition being FeO,Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
Chrome iron ore crystallises in octahedra of sp. gr. 4·4; it has a feeble
metallic lustre, is of a greyish-black colour, and gives a brown powder.
It is very feebly acted on by acids, but when fused with potassium
acid sulphate it gives a soluble mass, which contains a chromic salt,
besides potassium sulphate and ferrous sulphate. In practice the
treatment of chrome iron ore is mainly carried on for the preparation
of chromates, and not of chromic salts, and therefore we will trace the
history of the element by beginning with chromic acid, and especially
with the working up of the chrome iron ore into <i>potassium dichromate</i>,
K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, as the most common salt of this acid. It must be remarked
that chromic anhydride, CrO<sub>3</sub>, is only obtained in an anhydrous state,
and is distinguished for its capacity for easily giving anhydro-salts
with the alkalis, containing one, two, and even three equivalents of the
anhydride to one equivalent of base. Thus among the potassium salts
there is known the normal or yellow chromate, K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, which corresponds
to, and is perfectly isomorphous with, potassium sulphate, easily
forms isomorphous mixtures with it, and is not therefore suitable for a
process in which it is necessary to separate the salt from a mixture
containing sulphates. As in the presence of a certain excess of acid,
the dichromate, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> = 2K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> + 2HX - 2KX - H<sub>2</sub>O, is easily
formed from K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, the object of the manufacturer is to produce
such a dichromate, the more so as it contains a larger proportion of the
elements of chromic acid than the normal salt. Finely-ground chrome
iron ore, when heated with an alkali, absorbs oxygen almost as easily
(Chapter III., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_7_180">7</a>) as a mixture of the oxides of manganese with
an alkali. This absorption is due to the presence of chromic oxide,
which is oxidised into the anhydride, and then combines with the
alkali Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> = 2CrO<sub>3</sub>. As the oxidation and formation of the
chromate proceeds, the mass turns <i>yellow</i>. The iron is also oxidised,
but does not give ferric acid, because the capacity of the chromium for
oxidation is incomparably greater than that of the iron.</p>

<p>A mixture of lime (sometimes with potash) and chrome iron ore
is heated in a reverberatory furnace, with free access of air and at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
red heat for several hours, until the mass becomes yellow; it then
contains normal calcium chromate, CaCr_O<sub>4</sub>, which is insoluble in
water in the presence of an excess of lime.<a name="FNanchor_1_BIS_366" id="FNanchor_1_BIS_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_BIS_366" class="fnanchor">[1 bis]</a> The resultant mass is
ground up, and treated with water and sulphuric acid. The excess of
lime forms gypsum, and the soluble calcium dichromate, CaCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,
together with a certain amount of iron, pass into solution. The
solution is poured off, and chalk added to it; this precipitates the
ferric oxide (the ferrous oxide is converted into ferric oxide in the
furnace) and forms a fresh quantity of gypsum, while the chromic acid
remains in solution&mdash;that is, it does not form the sparingly-soluble
normal salt (1 part soluble in 240 parts of water). The solution then
contains a fairly pure calcium dichromate, which by double decomposition
gives other chromates; for example, with a solution of potassium
sulphate it gives a precipitate of calcium sulphate and a solution of
potassium dichromate, which crystallises when evaporated.<a name="FNanchor_2_367" id="FNanchor_2_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_367" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><i>Potassium dichromate</i>, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, easily crystallises from acid solutions
in red, well-formed prismatic crystals, which fuse at a red heat
and evolve oxygen at a very high temperature, leaving chromic oxide
and the normal salt, which undergoes no further change: 2K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
= 2K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> + Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>3</sub>. At the ordinary temperature 100 parts
of water dissolve 10 parts of this salt, and the solubility increases as
the temperature rises. It is most important to note that the
dichromate does not contain water, it is K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> + CrO<sub>3</sub>; the acid
salt corresponding to potassium acid sulphate, KHSO<sub>4</sub>, does not exist.
It does not even evolve heat when dissolving in water, but on the contrary
produces cold, <i>i.e.</i> it does not form a very stable compound with
water. The solution and the salt itself are poisonous, and act as
powerful oxidising agents, which is the character of chromic acid in
general. When heated with sulphur or organic substances, with
sulphurous anhydride, hydrogen sulphide, &amp;c., this salt is deoxidised,
yielding chromic compounds.<a name="FNanchor_2_BIS_368" id="FNanchor_2_BIS_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_BIS_368" class="fnanchor">[2 bis]</a> Potassium dichromate<a name="FNanchor_3_369" id="FNanchor_3_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_369" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> is used in the
arts and in chemistry as a source for the preparation of all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
chromium compounds. It is converted into yellow pigments by means
of double decomposition with salts of lead, barium, and zinc. When
solutions of the salts of these metals are mixed with potassium
dichromate (in dyeing generally mixed with soda, in order to obtain
normal salts), they are precipitated as insoluble normal salts; for
example, 2BaCl<sub>2</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2BaCrO<sub>4</sub> + 2KCl + 2HCl. It
follows from this that these salts are insoluble in dilute acids, but
the precipitation is not complete (as it would be with the normal salt).
The barium and zinc salts are of a lemon yellow colour; the lead salt
has a still more intense colour passing into orange. Yellow cotton
prints are dyed with this pigment. The silver salt, Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, is of a
bright red colour.</p>

<p>When potassium dichromate is mixed with potassium hydroxide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
or carbonate (carbonic anhydride being disengaged in the latter case) it
forms the <i>normal</i> salt, K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, known as <i>yellow chromate of potassium</i>.
Its specific gravity is 2·7, being almost the same as that of the dichromate.
It absorbs heat in dissolving; one part of the salt dissolves in
1·75 part of water at the ordinary temperature, forming a yellow
solution. When mixed even with such feeble acids as acetic, and more
especially with the ordinary acids, it gives the dichromate, and Graham
obtained a trichromate, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>3</sub>O<sub>10</sub> = K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>,2CrO<sub>3</sub>, by mixing a
solution of the latter salt with an excess of nitric acid.</p>

<p><i>Chromic anhydride</i> is obtained by preparing a saturated solution of
potassium dichromate at the ordinary temperature, and pouring it in a
thin stream into an equal volume of pure sulphuric acid.<a name="FNanchor_4_370" id="FNanchor_4_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_370" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> On mixing,
the temperature naturally rises; when slowly cooled, the solution
deposits chromic anhydride in needle-shaped crystals of a red colour
sometimes several centimetres long. The crystals are freed from the
mother liquor by placing them on a porous tile.<a name="FNanchor_4_BIS_371" id="FNanchor_4_BIS_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_BIS_371" class="fnanchor">[4 bis]</a> It is very important
at this point to call attention to the fact that a hydrate of chromic
anhydride is never obtained in the decomposition of chromic compounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
but always the <i>anhydride</i>, CrO<sub>3</sub>. The corresponding hydrate, CrO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>,
or any other hydrate, is not even known. Nevertheless, it must be
admitted that chromic acid is bibasic, because it forms salts isomorphous
or perfectly analogous with the salts formed by sulphuric acid, which is
the best example of a bibasic acid. A clear proof of the bibasicity of
CrO<sub>3</sub> is seen in the fact that the anhydride and salts give (when heated
with sodium chloride and sulphuric acid) a volatile chloranhydride,
CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, containing two atoms of chlorine as a bibasic acid should.<a name="FNanchor_5_372" id="FNanchor_5_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_372" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Chromic anhydride is a red crystalline substance, which is converted
into a black mass by heat; it fuses at 190°, and disengages oxygen
above 250°, leaving a residue of chromium dioxide, CrO<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_6_373" id="FNanchor_6_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_373" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and, on still
further heating, chromic oxide, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Chromic anhydride is exceedingly
soluble in water, and even attracts moisture from the air, but, as
was mentioned above, it does not form any definite compound with
water. The specific gravity of its crystals is 2·7, and when fused it has
a specific gravity 2·6. The solution presents perfectly defined acid
properties. It liberates carbonic anhydride from carbonates; gives
insoluble precipitates of the chromates with salts of barium, lead, silver,
and mercury.</p>

<p>The action of hydrogen peroxide on a solution of chromic acid or of
potassium dichromate gives a blue solution, which very quickly becomes
colourless with the disengagement of oxygen. Barreswill showed that
this is due to the formation of a <i>perchromic anhydride</i>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, corresponding
with sulphur peroxide. This peroxide is remarkable from the
fact that it very easily dissolves in ether and is much more stable in
this solution, so that, by shaking up hydrogen peroxide mixed with a
small quantity of chromic acid, with ether, it is possible to transfer all
the blue substance formed to the ether.<a name="FNanchor_6_BIS_374" id="FNanchor_6_BIS_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_BIS_374" class="fnanchor">[6 bis]</a></p>

<p>With oxygen acids, chromic acid evolves oxygen; for example, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
sulphuric acid the following reaction takes place: 2CrO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
= Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O. It will be readily understood from this that
<i>a mixture of chromic acid</i> or <i>of its salts with sulphuric acid</i> forms an
excellent <i>oxidising agent</i>, which is frequently employed in chemical
laboratories and even for technical purposes as a means of oxidation.
Thus hydrogen sulphide and sulphurous anhydride are converted into
sulphuric acid by this means. Chromic acid is able to act as a powerful
oxidising agent because it passes into chromic oxide, and in so doing
disengages half of the oxygen contained in it: 2CrO<sub>3</sub> = Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>3</sub>.
Thus chromic anhydride itself is a powerful oxidising agent, and is
therefore employed instead of nitric acid in galvanic batteries (as a
depolariser), the hydrogen evolved at the carbon being then oxidised,
and the chromic acid converted into a non-volatile product of deoxidation,
instead of yielding, as nitric acid does, volatile lower oxides of
offensive odour. Organic substances are more or less perfectly oxidised
by means of chromic anhydride, although this generally requires the aid
of heat, and does not proceed in the presence of alkalis, but generally
<i>in the presence of acids</i>. In acting on a solution of potassium iodide,
chromic acid, like many oxidising agents, liberates iodine; the reaction
proceeds in proportion to the amount of CrO<sub>3</sub> present, and may serve
for determining the amount of CrO<sub>3</sub>, since the amount of iodine liberated
can be accurately determined by the iodometric method (Chapter XX.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_42_313">42</a>). If chromic anhydride be ignited in a stream of ammonia, it
gives chromic oxide, water, and nitrogen. In all cases when chromic
acid acts as an oxidising agent in the presence of acids and under the
action of heat, the product of its deoxidation is a chromic salt, CrX<sub>3</sub>,
which is characterised by the green colour of its solution, so that the
<i>red</i> or yellow <i>solution</i> of a salt of chromic acid is then transformed into
a <i>green solution</i> of a chromic salt, derived from chromic oxide, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
which is closely analogous to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and other bases of the composition
R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This analogy is seen in the insolubility of the anhydrous
oxide, in the gelatinous form of the colloidal hydrate, in the formation
of alums,<a name="FNanchor_7_375" id="FNanchor_7_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_375" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of a volatile chloride of chromium, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_7_BIS_376" id="FNanchor_7_BIS_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_376" class="fnanchor">[7 bis]</a></p>

<p><i>Chromic oxide</i>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, rarely found, and in small quantities, in chrome
ochre, is formed by the oxidation of chromium and its lower oxides, by
the reduction of chromates (for example, of ammonium or mercuric
chromate) and by the decomposition (splitting up) of the saline compounds
of the oxide itself, CrX<sub>3</sub> or Cr<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>, like alumina, which it
resembles in forming a feeble base easily giving double and basic salts,
which are either green or violet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a><br /><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a><br /><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>The reduction of chromic oxide&mdash;for instance, in a solution by zinc
and sulphuric acid&mdash;leads to the formation of chromous oxide, CrO, and
its salts, CrX<sub>2</sub>, of a blue colour (<i>see</i> Notes <a href="#Footnote_7_375">7</a> and <a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_376">7</a><sup>bis</sup>). The further
reduction<a name="FNanchor_8_377" id="FNanchor_8_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_377" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of oxide of chromium and its corresponding compounds
gives <i>metallic chromium</i>. Deville obtained it (probably containing
carbon) by reducing chromic oxide with carbon, at a temperature near
the melting point of platinum, about 1750°, but the metal itself does
not fuse at this temperature. Chromium has a steel-grey colour and is
very hard (sp. gr. 5·9), takes a good polish, and dissolves in hydrochloric
acid, but cold dilute sulphuric and nitric acids have no action
upon it. Bunsen obtained metallic chromium by decomposing a solution
of chromic chloride, Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, by a galvanic current, as scales of a grey
colour (sp. gr. 7·3). Wöhler obtained crystalline chromium by igniting
a mixture of the anhydrous chromic chloride Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_376">7 bis</a>)
with finely-divided zinc, and sodium and potassium chlorides, at the
boiling-point of zinc. When the resultant mass has cooled the zinc may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
be dissolved in dilute nitric acid, and grey crystalline chromium (sp. gr.
6·81) is left behind. Frémy also prepared crystalline chromium by the
action of the vapour of sodium on anhydrous chromic chloride in a
stream of hydrogen, using the apparatus shown in the accompanying
drawing, and placing the sodium and the chromic chloride in separate
porcelain boats. The tube containing these boats is only heated when
it is quite full of dry hydrogen. The crystals of metallic chromium
obtained in the tube are grey cubes having a considerable hardness and
withstanding the action of powerful acids, and even of aqua regia.
The chromium obtained by Wöhler by the action of a galvanic current
is, on the contrary, acted on under these conditions. The reason of
this difference must be looked for in the presence of impurities, and in
the crystalline structure. But in any case, among the properties of
metallic chromium, the following may be considered established: it is
white in colour, with a specific gravity of about 6·7, is extremely hard
in a crystalline form, is not oxidised by air at the ordinary temperature,
and with carbon it forms alloys like cast iron and steel.</p>

<p>The two analogues of chromium, <i>molybdenum</i> and <i>tungsten</i> (or wolfram),
are of still rarer occurrence in nature, and form acid oxides, RO<sub>3</sub>,
which are still less energetic than CrO<sub>3</sub>. Tungsten occurs in the somewhat
rare minerals, <i>scheelite</i>, CaWO<sub>4</sub>, and <i>wolfram</i>; the latter being an
isomorphous mixture of the normal tungstates of iron and manganese,
(MnFe)WO<sub>4</sub>. Molybdenum is most frequently met with as <i>molybdenite</i>,
MoS<sub>2</sub>, which presents a certain resemblance to graphite in its physical
properties and softness. It also occurs, but much more rarely, as a
yellow lead ore, PbMoO<sub>4</sub>. In both these forms molybdenum occurs in
the primary rocks, in granites, gneiss, &amp;c., and in iron and copper ores<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
in Saxony, Sweden, and Finland. Tungsten ores are sometimes met
with in considerable masses in the primary rocks of Bohemia and
Saxony, and also in England, America, and the Urals. The preliminary
treatment of the ore is very simple; for example, the sulphide,
MoS<sub>2</sub>, is roasted, and thus converted into sulphurous anhydride and
molybdic anhydride, MoO<sub>3</sub>, which is then dissolved in alkalis, generally
in ammonia. The ammonium molybdate is then treated with acids,
when the sparingly soluble molybdic acid is precipitated. Wolfram is
treated in a different manner. Most frequently the finely-ground ore is
repeatedly boiled with hydrochloric and nitric acids, and the resultant
solutions (of salts of manganese and iron) poured off, until the dark
brown mass of ore disappears, whilst the tungstic acid remains, mixed
with silica, as an insoluble residue; it is treated also with ammonia,
and is thus converted into soluble ammonium tungstate, which passes
into solution and yields tungstic acid when treated with acids. This
hydrate is then ignited, and leaves tungstic anhydride. The general
character of molybdic and tungstic anhydrides is analogous to that of
chromic anhydride; they are anhydrides of a feebly acid character,
which easily give polyacid salts and colloid solutions.<a name="FNanchor_8_BIS_378" id="FNanchor_8_BIS_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_BIS_378" class="fnanchor">[8 bis]</a></p>

<p>Hydrogen (which does not directly form compounds with Cr, Mo,
and W) reduces molybdic and tungstic anhydride at a red heat; and
this forms the means of obtaining metallic molybdenum and tungsten.
<i>Both metals</i> are infusible, and both under the action of heat form
compounds with carbon and iron (the addition of tungsten to steel
renders the latter ductile and hard).<a name="FNanchor_9_379" id="FNanchor_9_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_379" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Molybdenum forms a grey powder,
which scarcely aggregates under a most powerful heat, and has a specific
gravity of 8·5. It is not acted on by the air at the ordinary temperature,
but when ignited it is first converted into a brown, and then into a
blue oxide, and lastly into molybdic anhydride. Acids do not act on it&mdash;that
is, it does not liberate hydrogen from them, not even from
hydrochloric acid&mdash;but strong sulphuric acid disengages sulphurous
anhydride, forming a brown mass, containing a lower oxide of molybdenum.
Alkalis in solution do not act on molybdenum, but when fused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
with it hydrogen is given off, which shows, as does its whole character,
the acid properties of the metal. The properties of tungsten are almost
identical; it is infusible, has an iron-grey colour, is exceedingly hard, so
that it even scratches glass. Its specific gravity is 19·1 (according to
Roscoe), so that, like uranium, platinum, &amp;c., it is one of the heaviest
metals.<a name="FNanchor_9_BIS_380" id="FNanchor_9_BIS_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_BIS_380" class="fnanchor">[9 bis]</a> Just as sulphur and chromium have their corresponding
persulphuric and perchromic acids, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>8</sub>, having the
properties of peroxides, and corresponding to peroxide of hydrogen, so
also molybdenum and tungsten are known to give <i>permolybdic</i> and <i>pertungstic</i>
acids, H<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>W<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, which have the properties of true
peroxides, <i>i.e.</i> easily disengage iodine from KI and chlorine from HCl,
easily part with their oxygen, and are formed by the action of peroxide
of hydrogen, into which they are readily reconverted (hence they may
be regarded as compounds of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with 2MoO<sub>3</sub> and 2WO<sub>3</sub>), &amp;c. Their
formation (Boerwald 1884, Kemmerer 1891) is at once seen in the
coloration (not destroyed by boiling), which is obtained on mixing a
solution of the salts with peroxide of hydrogen, and on treating, for instance,
molybdic acid with a solution of peroxide of hydrogen (Péchard
1892). The acid then forms an orange-coloured solution, which after
evaporation in vacuo leaves Mo<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O as a crystalline powder,
and loses 4H<sub>2</sub>O at 100°, beyond which it decomposes with the evolution
of oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_9_TRI_381" id="FNanchor_9_TRI_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_TRI_381" class="fnanchor">[9 tri]</a></p>

<p><i>Uranium</i>, U = 240, has the highest atomic weight of all the
analogues of chromium, and indeed of all the elements yet known. Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
highest salt-forming oxide, UO<sub>3</sub>, shows very feeble acid properties.
Although it gives sparingly-soluble yellow compounds with alkalis,
which fully correspond with the dichromates&mdash;for example, Na<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
= Na<sub>2</sub>O,2UO<sub>3</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_10_382" id="FNanchor_10_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_382" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;yet it more frequently and easily reacts with acids, HX,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
forming fluorescent yellowish-green salts of the composition UO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>,
and in this respect uranic trioxide, UO<sub>3</sub>, differs from chromic anhydride,
CrO<sub>3</sub>, although the latter is able to give the oxychloride, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. In
molybdenum and tungsten, however, we see a clear transition from
chromium to uranium. Thus, for example, chromyl chloride, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,
is a brown liquid which volatilises without change, and is completely
decomposed by water; molybdenum oxychloride, MoO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, is a crystalline
substance of a yellow colour, which is volatile and soluble in
water (Blomstrand), like many salts. Tungsten oxychloride, WO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,
stands still nearer to uranyl chloride in its properties; it forms yellow
scales on which water and alkalis act, as they do on many salts (zinc
chloride, ferric chloride, aluminium chloride, stannic chloride, &amp;c.), and
perfectly corresponds with the difficultly volatile salt, UO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (obtained
by Peligot by the action of chlorine on ignited uranium dioxide, UO<sub>2</sub>),
which is also yellow and gives a yellow solution with water, like all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
salts UO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>. The property of uranic oxide, UO<sub>3</sub>, of forming salts
UO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> is shown in the fact that the hydrated oxide of uranium,
UO<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub>, which is obtained from the nitrate, carbonate, and other
salts by the loss of the elements of the acid, is easily soluble in acids,
as well as in the fact that the lower grades of oxidation of uranium are
able, when treated with nitric acid, to form an easily crystallisable
uranyl nitrate, UO<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O; this is the most commonly occurring
uranium salt.<a name="FNanchor_11_383" id="FNanchor_11_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_383" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><i>Uranium</i>, which gives an oxide, UO<sub>3</sub>, and the corresponding salt
UO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> and dioxide UO<sub>2</sub>, to which the salts UX<sub>4</sub> correspond, is rarely
met with in nature. Uranite or the double orthophosphate of uranic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
oxide, R(UO<sub>2</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, where R = Cu or Ca, uranium-vitriol
U(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, samarakite, and æschynite, are very rarely found, and
then only in small quantities. Of more frequent and abundant
occurrence is the non-crystalline, earthy brown uranium ore known as
<i>pitchblende</i> (sp. gr. 7·2), which is mainly composed of the intermediate
oxide, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> = UO<sub>2</sub>,2UO<sub>3</sub>. This ore is found at Joachimsthal in Bohemia
and in Cornwall. It usually contains a number of different impurities,
chiefly sulphides and arsenides of lead and iron, as well as lime
and silica compounds. In order to expel the arsenic and sulphur it is
roasted, ground, washed with dilute hydrochloric acid, which does not
dissolve the uranoso-uranic oxide, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, and the residue is dissolved
in nitric acid, which transforms the uranium oxide into the nitrate,
UO<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>It must be observed that the oxide of uranium, first distinguished
by Klaproth (1789), was for a long time regarded as able to give
metallic uranium under the action of charcoal and other reducing agents
(with the aid of heat). But the substance thus obtained was only the
<i>uranium dioxide</i>, UO<sub>2</sub>. The compound nature of this dioxide,<a name="FNanchor_12_384" id="FNanchor_12_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_384" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> or the
presence of oxygen in it, was demonstrated by Peligot (1841), by igniting
it with charcoal in a stream of chlorine. He thus obtained a volatile
<i>uranium tetrachloride</i>, UCl<sub>4</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_13_385" id="FNanchor_13_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_385" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> which, when heated with sodium, gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
<i>metallic uranium</i> as a grey metal, having a specific gravity of 18·7, and
liberating hydrogen from acids, with the formation of green uranous
salts, UX<sub>4</sub>, which act as powerful reducing agents.<a name="FNanchor_14_386" id="FNanchor_14_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_386" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>As the salts of uranic oxide are reduced in the absence of organic
matter by the action of light, and as they impart a characteristic
coloration to glass,<a name="FNanchor_15_387" id="FNanchor_15_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_387" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> they find a certain application in photography and

<p>If we compare together the highly acid elements, sulphur, selenium,
and tellurium, of the uneven series, with chromium, molybdenum,
tungsten, and uranium of the even series, we find that the resemblance
of the properties of the higher form RO<sub>3</sub> does not extend to the lower
forms, and even entirely disappears in the elements, for there is
not the smallest resemblance between sulphur and chromium and their
analogues in a free state. In other words, this means that the small
periods, like Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, containing seven elements, do
not contain any near analogues of chromium, molybdenum, &amp;c., and
therefore their true position among the other elements must be looked
for only in those large periods which contain two small periods, and
whose type is seen in the period containing: K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn,
Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br. These large periods contain
Ca and Zn, giving RO, Sc, and Ga of the third group, Ti and Ge
giving RO<sub>2</sub>, V and As forming R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Cr and Se of the sixth group,
Mn and Br of the seventh group, and the remaining elements, Fe,
Co, Ni, form connective members of the intermediate eighth group, to
the description of the representatives of which we shall turn in the
following chapters. We will now proceed to describe <i>manganese</i>,
Mn = 55, as an element of the seventh group of the even series, directly
following after Cr = 52, which corresponds with Br = 80 to the same
degree that Cr does with Se = 79. For chromium, selenium, and
bromine very close analogues are known, but for manganese as yet
none have been obtained&mdash;that is, it is the only representative of the
even series in the seventh group. In placing manganese with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
halogens in one group, the periodic system of the elements only requires
that it should bear an analogy to the halogens in the higher type of
oxidation&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in the salts and acids&mdash;whilst it requires that as great
a difference should be expected in the lower types and elements as there
exists between chromium or molybdenum and sulphur or selenium.
And this is actually the case. The elements of the seventh group form
a higher salt-forming oxide, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and its corresponding hydrate,
HRO<sub>4</sub>, and salts&mdash;for example, KClO<sub>4</sub>. Manganese in the form of
potassium permanganate, KMnO<sub>4</sub>, actually presents a great analogy in
many respects to potassium perchlorate, KClO<sub>4</sub>. The analogy of the
crystalline form of both salts was shown by Mitscherlich. The salts of
permanganic acid are also nearly all soluble in water, like those of
perchloric acid, and if the silver salt of the latter, AgClO<sub>4</sub>, be sparingly
soluble in water, so also is silver permanganate, AgMnO<sub>4</sub>. The specific
volume of potassium perchlorate is equal to 55, because its specific
gravity = 2·54; the specific volume of potassium permanganate is equal
to 58, because its specific gravity = 2·71. So that the volumes of
equivalent quantities are in this instance approximately the same
whilst the atomic volumes of chlorine (35·5/1·3 = 27) and manganese
(55/7·5) are in the ratio 4 : 1. In a free state the higher acids HClO<sub>4</sub>
and HMnO<sub>4</sub> are both soluble in water and volatile, both are powerful
oxidisers&mdash;in a word, their analogy is still closer than that of chromic
and sulphuric acids, and those points of distinction which they present
also appear among the nearest analogues&mdash;for example, in sulphuric and
telluric acids, in hydrochloric and hydriodic acids, &amp;c. Besides Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
manganese gives a lower grade of oxidation, MnO<sub>3</sub>, analogous to
sulphuric and chromic trioxides, and with it corresponds potassium
manganate, K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub>, isomorphous with potassium sulphate.<a name="FNanchor_16_388" id="FNanchor_16_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_388" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In the
still lower grades of oxidation, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MnO, there is hardly any
similarity to chlorine, whilst every point of resemblance disappears
when we come to the elements themselves&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to manganese and
chlorine&mdash;for manganese is a metal, like iron, which combines directly
with chlorine to form a saline compound, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, analogous to magnesium
chloride.<a name="FNanchor_17_389" id="FNanchor_17_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_389" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Manganese belongs to the number of metals widely distributed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
nature, especially in those localities where iron occurs, whose ores
frequently contain compounds of manganous oxide, MnO, which presents
a resemblance to ferrous oxide, FeO, and to magnesia. In many minerals
magnesia and the oxides allied to it are replaced by manganous oxide;
calcspars and magnesites&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> R&#8243;CO<sub>3</sub> in general&mdash;are frequently met
with containing manganous carbonate, which also occurs in a separate
state, although but rarely. The soil also and the ash of plants generally
contain a small quantity of manganese. In the analysis of minerals
it is generally found that manganese occurs together with magnesia,
because, like it, manganous oxide remains in solution in the presence of
ammoniacal salts, not being precipitated by reagents. The property of
this manganous oxide, MnO, of passing into the higher grades of oxidation
under the influence of heat, alkalis, and air, gives an easy means
not only of discovering the presence of manganese in admixture with
magnesia, but also of separating these two analogous bases. Magnesia is
not able to give higher grades of oxidation, whilst manganese gives them
with great facility. Thus, for instance, an <i>alkaline</i> solution of sodium
hypochlorite produces a precipitate of manganese dioxide in a solution of
a manganous salt: MnCl<sub>2</sub> + NaClO + 2NaHO = MnO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + 3NaCl;
whilst magnesia is not changed under these circumstances, and remains
in the form of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. If the magnesia be precipitated owing to the
presence of alkali, it may be dissolved in acetic acid, in which manganese
dioxide is insoluble. The presence of small quantities of manganese
may also be recognised by the green coloration which alkalis acquire
when heated with manganese compounds in the air. This green coloration
depends on the property of manganese of giving a green alkaline
manganate: MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 4KHO + O<sub>2</sub> = K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub> + 2KCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus
<i>the faculty of oxidising in the presence of alkalis</i> forms an essential
character of manganese. The higher grades of oxidation containing
Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and MnO<sub>3</sub> are quite unknown in nature, and even MnO<sub>2</sub> is not
so widely spread in nature as the ores composed of manganous compounds
which are met with nearly everywhere. The most important
ore of manganese is its dioxide, or so-called <i>peroxide</i>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, which is
known in mineralogy as <i>pyrolusite</i>. Manganese also occurs as an
oxide corresponding with magnetic iron ore, MnO,Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,
forming the mineral known as <i>hausmannite</i>. The oxide Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> also
occurs in nature as the anhydrous mineral <i>braunite</i>, and in a hydrated
form, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, called <i>manganite</i>. Both of these often occur as an
admixture in pyrolusite. Besides which, manganese is met with in
nature as a rose-coloured mineral, <i>rhodonite</i>, or silicate, MnSiO<sub>3</sub>. Very
fine and rich deposits of manganese ores have been found in the
Caucasus, the Urals, and along the Dnieper. Those at the Sharapansky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
district of the Government of Kutais and at Nicopol on the Dnieper
are particularly rich. A large quantity of the ore (as much as 100,000
tons yearly) is exported from these localities.</p>

<p>Thus manganese gives oxides of the following forms: MnO,
manganous oxide, and manganous salts, MnX<sub>2</sub>, corresponding with the
base, which resembles magnesia and ferrous oxide in many respects;
Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a very feeble base, giving salts, MnX<sub>3</sub>, analogous to the
aluminium and ferric salts, easily reduced to MnX<sub>2</sub>; MnO<sub>2</sub>, dioxide,
generally called peroxide, an almost indifferent oxide, or feebly acid;<a name="FNanchor_18_390" id="FNanchor_18_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_390" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
MnO<sub>3</sub>, manganic anhydride, which forms salts resembling potassium
sulphate;<a name="FNanchor_18_BIS_391" id="FNanchor_18_BIS_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_BIS_391" class="fnanchor">[18 bis]</a> Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, permanganic anhydride, giving salts analogous
to the perchlorates.</p>

<p><i>All the oxides of manganese when heated with acids give salts</i>, MnX<sub>2</sub>,
corresponding with the lower grade of oxidation, <i>manganous oxide</i>,
MnO. Manganic oxide, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is a feebly energetic base; it is true
that it dissolves in hydrochloric acid and gives a dark solution containing
the salt MnCl<sub>3</sub>, but the latter when heated evolves chlorine
and gives a salt corresponding with manganous oxide MnCl<sub>2</sub>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> at
first: Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 6HCl = 3H<sub>2</sub>O + Mn<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, and then the Mn<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> decomposes
into 2MnCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>. None of the remaining higher grades of
oxidation have a basic character, but <i>act as oxidising agents in the
presence of acids</i>, disengaging oxygen and passing into salts of the lower
grade of oxidation of manganese, MnO. Owing to this circumstance,
<i>the manganous salts</i> are often obtained; they are, for instance, left in
the residue when the dioxide is used for the preparation of oxygen and
chlorine.<a name="FNanchor_19_392" id="FNanchor_19_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_392" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>As the salts of manganous oxide MnX<sub>2</sub> closely resemble (and are
isomorphous with) the salts of magnesia MgX<sub>2</sub> in many respects (with
the exception of the fact that MnX<sub>2</sub> are rose coloured and are easily
oxidised in the presence of alkalis), we will not dwell upon them, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a><br /><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
limit ourselves to illustrating the chemical character of manganese by
describing the metal and its corresponding acids. The fact alone that
the oxides of manganese are not reduced to the metal when ignited in
hydrogen (whilst the oxides of iron give metallic iron under these
circumstances), but only to manganous oxide, MnO, shows that
manganese has a considerable affinity for oxygen&mdash;that is, it is difficult
to reduce. This may be effected, however, by means of charcoal or
sodium at a very high temperature. A mixture of one of the oxides of
manganese with charcoal or organic matter gives fused <i>metallic manganese</i>
under the powerful heat developed by coke with an artificial
draught. The metal was obtained for the first time in this manner by
Gahn, after Pott, and more especially Scheele, had in the last century
shown the difference between the compounds of iron and manganese
(they were previously regarded as being the same). Manganese is prepared
by mixing one of its oxides in a finely-divided state with oil and
soot; the resultant mass is then first ignited in order to decompose
the organic matter, and afterwards strongly heated in a charcoal crucible.
The manganese thus obtained, however, contains, as a rule, a considerable
amount of silicon and other impurities. Its specific gravity varies
between 7·2 and 8·0. It has a light grey colour, a feebly metallic
lustre, and although it is very hard it can be scratched by a file. It
rapidly oxidises in air, being converted into a black oxide; water acts
on it with the evolution of hydrogen&mdash;this decomposition proceeds very
rapidly with boiling water, and if the metal contain carbon.<a name="FNanchor_20_393" id="FNanchor_20_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_393" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been shown above that if manganese dioxide, or any
lower oxide of manganese, be heated with an alkali in the presence of
air, the mixture absorbs oxygen,<a name="FNanchor_21_394" id="FNanchor_21_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_394" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and forms an alkaline manganate of a
green colour: 2KHO + MnO<sub>2</sub> + O = K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. Steam is disengaged
during the ignition of the mixture, and if this does not take
place there is no absorption of oxygen. The oxidation proceeds much
more rapidly if, before igniting in air, potassium chlorate or nitre be
added to the mixture, and this is the method of preparing <i>potassium
manganate</i>, K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub>. The resultant mass dissolved in a small quantity
of water gives a dark green solution, which, when evaporated under the
receiver of an air-pump over sulphuric acid, deposits green crystals of
exactly the same form as potassium sulphate&mdash;namely, six-sided prisms
and pyramids. The composition of the product is not changed by being
re-dissolved, if perfectly pure water free from air and carbonic acid be
taken. But in the presence of even very feeble acids the solution of
this salt changes its colour and becomes red, and deposits manganese
dioxide. The same decomposition takes place when the salt is heated
with water, but when diluted with a large quantity of unboiled water
manganese dioxide does not separate, although the solution turns red.
This change of colour depends on the fact that potassium manganate,
K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub>, whose solution is green, is transformed into potassium permanganate,
KMnO<sub>4</sub>, whose solution is of a red colour. The reaction
proceeding under the influence of acids and a large quantity of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
is expressed in the following manner: 3K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = 2KMnO<sub>4</sub>
+ MnO<sub>2</sub> + 4KHO. If there is a large proportion of acid and the decomposition
is aided by heat, the manganese dioxide and potassium
permanganate are also decomposed, with formation of manganous salt.
Exactly the same decomposition as takes place under the action of acids
is also accomplished by magnesium sulphate, which reacts in many cases
like an acid. When water holding atmospheric oxygen in solution acts
on a solution of potassium manganate, the oxygen combines directly
with the manganate and forms potassium permanganate, without
precipitating manganese dioxide, 2K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub> + O + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2KMnO<sub>4</sub>
+ 2KHO. Thus a solution of potassium manganate undergoes a very
characteristic change in colour and passes from green to red; hence this
salt received the name of <i>chameleon mineral</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22_395" id="FNanchor_22_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_395" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><i>Potassium permanganate</i>, KMnO<sub>4</sub>, crystallises in well-formed, long
red prisms with a bright green metallic lustre. In the arts the potash
is frequently replaced by soda, and by other alkaline bases, but no salt
of permanganic acid crystallises so well as the potassium salt, and
therefore this salt is exclusively used in chemical laboratories. One
part of the crystalline salt dissolves in 15 parts of water at the ordinary
temperature. The solution is of a very deep <i>red colour</i>, which is so
intense that it is still clearly observable after being highly diluted with
water. In a solid state it is decomposed by heat, with evolution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
oxygen, a residue consisting of the lower oxides of manganese and
potassium oxide being left.<a name="FNanchor_22_BIS_396" id="FNanchor_22_BIS_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_BIS_396" class="fnanchor">[22 bis]</a> A mixture of permanganate of potassium,
phosphorous and sulphur takes fire when struck or rubbed, a
mixture of the permanganate with carbon only takes fire when heated,
not when struck. The instability of the salt is also seen in the fact
that its solution is decomposed by peroxide of hydrogen, which at the
same time it decomposes. A number of substances reduce potassium
permanganate to manganese dioxide (in which case the red solution
becomes colourless).<a name="FNanchor_23_397" id="FNanchor_23_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_397" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Many organic substances (although far from
all, even when boiled in a solution of permanganate) act in this manner,
being oxidised at the expense of a portion of its oxygen. Thus, a
solution of sugar decomposes a cold solution of potassium permanganate.
In the presence of an excess of alkali, with a small quantity of sugar,
the reduction leads to the formation of potassium manganate, because
2KMnO<sub>4</sub> + 2KHO = O + 2K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. With a considerable amount
of sugar and a more prolonged action, the solution turns brown and
precipitates manganese dioxide or even oxide. In the oxidation of
many organic bodies by an alkaline solution of KMnO<sub>4</sub> generally three-eighths
of the oxygen in the salt are utilised for oxidation: 2KMnO<sub>4</sub>
= K<sub>2</sub>O + 2MnO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub>. A portion of the alkali liberated is retained by
the manganese dioxide, and the other portion generally combines with
the substance oxidised, because the latter most frequently gives an acid
with an excess of alkali. A solution of potassium iodide acts in a
similar manner, being converted into potassium iodate at the expense of
the three atoms of oxygen disengaged by two molecules of potassium
permanganate.</p>

<p><i>In the presence of acids, potassium permanganate acts as an oxidising
agent</i> with still greater energy than in the presence of alkalis. At any
rate, a greater proportion of oxygen is then available for oxidation,
namely, not &#8540;, as in the presence of alkalis, but &#8541;, because in the first
instance manganese dioxide is formed, and in the second case manganous
oxide, or rather the salt, MnX<sub>2</sub>, corresponding with it. Thus, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
instance, in the presence of an excess of sulphuric acid, the decomposition
is accomplished in the following manner: 2KMnO<sub>4</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
= K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2MnSO<sub>4</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 5O. This decomposition, however, does
not proceed directly on mixing a solution of the salt with sulphuric
acid, and crystals of the salt even dissolve in oil of vitriol without the
evolution of oxygen, and this solution only decomposes by degrees after
a certain time. This is due to the fact that sulphuric acid liberates
free permanganic acid from the permanganate,<a name="FNanchor_24_398" id="FNanchor_24_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_398" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which acid is stable
in solution. But if, in the presence of acids and a permanganate, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
is a substance capable of absorbing oxygen&mdash;for instance, capable of
passing into a higher grade of oxidation&mdash;then the reduction of the
permanganic acid into manganous oxides sometimes proceeds directly
at the ordinary temperature. This reduction is very clearly seen,
because the solutions of potassium permanganate are red whilst the
manganous salts are almost colourless. Thus, for instance, nitrous acid
and its salts are converted into nitric acid and decolorise the acid solution
of the permanganate. Sulphurous anhydride and its salts immediately
decolorise potassium permanganate, forming sulphuric acid. Ferrous
salts, and in general salts of lower grades of oxidation capable of being
oxidised in solution, act in exactly the same manner. Sulphuretted
hydrogen is also oxidised to sulphuric acid; even mercury is oxidised
at the expense of permanganic acid, and decolorises its solution, being
converted into mercuric oxide. Moreover, the end point of these reactions
may easily be seen, and therefore, having first determined the amount
of active oxygen in one volume of a solution of potassium permanganate,
and knowing how many volumes are required to effect a given oxidation,
it is easy to determine the amount of an oxidisable substance in a
solution from the amount of permanganate expended (Marguerite's
method).</p>

<p>The oxidising action of KMnO<sub>4</sub>, like all other chemical reactions,
is not accomplished instantaneously, but only gradually. And, as the
course of the reaction is here easily followed by determining the amount
of salt unchanged in a sample taken at a given moment,<a name="FNanchor_25_399" id="FNanchor_25_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_399" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> the oxidising
reaction of potassium permanganate, in an acid liquid, was employed by
Harcourt and Esson (1865) as one of the first cases for the investigation
of the laws of the <i>rate of chemical change</i><a name="FNanchor_26_400" id="FNanchor_26_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_400" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> as a subject of great importance

C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O_<sub>4</sub>, which in oxidising gives carbonic anhydride, whilst, with
an excess of sulphuric acid, the potassium permanganate is converted
into manganous sulphate, MnSO<sub>4</sub>, so that the ultimate oxidation
will be expressed by the equation: 5C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 2MnKO<sub>4</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
= 10CO<sub>2</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2MnSO<sub>4</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O. The influence of the relative
amount of sulphuric acid is seen from the annexed table, which gives
the measure of reaction <i>p</i> per 100 parts of potassium permanganate,
taken four minutes after mixing, using n molecules of sulphuric acid,
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, per 2KMnO<sub>4</sub> + 5C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:</p>

<p class="noindent">These figures show that the rate of reaction&mdash;that is, the quantity of
permanganate changed in one minute&mdash;decreases proportionally to the
decrease in the amount of unchanged potassium permanganate. At the
commencement, about 2·6 per cent. of the salt taken was decomposed in
the course of one minute, whilst after an hour the rate was about
0·5 per cent. The same phenomena are observed in every case which
has been investigated, and this branch of theoretical or physical
chemistry, now studied by many,<a name="FNanchor_27_401" id="FNanchor_27_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_401" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> promises to explain the course of
chemical transformations from a fresh point of view, which is closely
allied to the doctrine of affinity, because the rate of reaction, without
doubt, is connected with the magnitude of the affinities acting between
the reacting substances.</p>

ordinary temperature is especially marked under the action of light. Thus it acts on
gelatin, as Poutven discovered; this is applied to photography in the processes of photogravure,
photo-lithography, pigment printing, &amp;c. Under the action of light this gelatin
is oxidised, and the chromic anhydride deoxidised into chromic oxide, which unites with
the gelatin and forms a compound insoluble in warm water, whilst where the light has not

chromic acid or potassium dichromate.</p></div>

sodium salts may be prepared in exactly the same manner as those of potassium. The
normal salt combines with ten equivalents of water, like Glauber's salt, with which it is
isomorphous. Its solution above 30° deposits the anhydrous salt. Sodium dichromate
crystals contain Na<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. The <i>ammonium salts of chromic acid</i> are obtained
by saturating the anhydride itself with ammonia. The dichromate is obtained by
saturating one part of the anhydride with ammonia, and then adding a second part of
anhydride and evaporating under the receiver of an air-pump. On ignition, the normal
and acid salts leave chromic oxide. Potassium ammonium chromate, NH<sub>4</sub>KCrO<sub>4</sub>, is
obtained in yellow needles from a solution of potassium dichromate in aqueous ammonia;
it not only loses ammonia and becomes converted into potassium dichromate when
ignited, but also by degrees at the ordinary temperature. This shows the feeble energy
of chromic acid, and its tendency to form stable dichromates. Magnesium chromate is
soluble in water, as also is the strontium salt. The calcium salt is also somewhat soluble,
but the barium salt is almost insoluble. The isomorphism with sulphuric acid is shown
in the chromates by the fact that the magnesium and ammonium salts form double salts
containing six equivalents of water, which are perfectly isomorphous with the corresponding
sulphates. The magnesium salt crystallises in large crystals containing seven
equivalents of water. The beryllium, cerium, and cobalt salts are insoluble in water.
Chromic acid dissolves manganous carbonate, but on evaporation the solution deposits
manganese dioxide, formed at the expense of the oxygen of the chromic acid. Chromic
acid also oxidises ferrous oxide, and ferric oxide is soluble in chromic acid.</p>

<p>One of the chromates most used by the dyer is the insoluble yellow lead chromate,
PbCrO<sub>4</sub> (Chapter XVIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_46_178">46</a>), which is precipitated on mixing solutions of
PbX<sub>2</sub> with soluble chromates. It easily forms a basic salt, having the composition
PbO,PbCrO<sub>4</sub>, as a crystalline powder, obtained by fusing the normal salt with nitre and
then rapidly washing in water. The same substance is obtained, although impure and
in small quantity, by treating lead chromate with neutral potassium chromate, especially
on boiling the mixture; and this gives the possibility of attaining, by means of these
materials, various tints of lead chromate, from yellow to red, passing through different
orange shades. The decomposition which takes place (incompletely) in this case is
as follows: 2PbCrO<sub>4</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> = PbCrO<sub>4</sub>,PbO + K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>&mdash;that is, potassium dichromate
is formed in solution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_370" id="Footnote_4_370"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_370"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The sulphuric acid should not contain any lower oxides of nitrogen, because they
reduce chromic anhydride into chromic oxide. If a solution of a chromate be heated
with an excess of acid&mdash;for instance, sulphuric or hydrochloric acid&mdash;oxygen or chlorine
is evolved, and a solution of a chromic salt is formed. Hence, under these circumstances,
chromic acid cannot be obtained from its salts. One of the first methods
employed consisted in converting its salts into volatile <i>chromium hexafluoride</i>, CrF<sub>6</sub>.
This compound, obtained by Unverdorben, may be prepared by mixing lead chromate
with fluor spar in a dry state, and treating the mixture with fuming sulphuric acid in a
platinum vessel: PbCrO<sub>4</sub> + 3CaF<sub>2</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = PbSO<sub>4</sub> + 3CaSO<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O + CrF<sub>6</sub>. Fuming
sulphuric acid is taken, and in considerable excess, because the chromium fluoride which
is formed is very easily decomposed by water. It is volatile, and forms a very caustic,
poisonous vapour, which condenses when cooled in a dry platinum vessel into a red,
exceedingly volatile liquid, which fumes powerfully in air. The vapours of this
substance when introduced into water are decomposed into hydrofluoric acid and
chromic anhydride: CrF<sub>6</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = CrO<sub>3</sub> + 6HF. If very little water be taken the hydrofluoric
acid volatilises, and chromic anhydride separates directly in crystals. The
chloranhydride of chromic acid, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (Note <a href="#Footnote_5_372">5</a>), is also decomposed in the same
manner. A solution of chromic acid and a precipitate of barium sulphate are formed by
treating the insoluble barium chromate with an equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid.
If carefully evaporated, the solution yields crystals of chromic anhydride. Fritzsche
gave a very convenient method of preparing chromic anhydride, based on the relation
of chromic to sulphuric acid. At the ordinary temperature the strong acid dissolves
both chromic anhydride and potassium chromate, but if a certain amount of water is
added to the solution the chromic anhydride separates, and if the amount of water be
increased the precipitated chromic anhydride is again dissolved. The chromic anhydride
is almost all separated from the solution when it contains two equivalents of
water to one equivalent of sulphuric acid. Many methods for the preparation of chromic
anhydride are based on this fact.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_372" id="Footnote_5_372"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_372"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Berzelius observed, and Rose carefully investigated, this remarkable reaction,
which occurs between chromic acid and sodium chloride in the presence of sulphuric
acid. If 10 parts of common salt be mixed with 12 parts of potassium dichromate, fused,
cooled, and broken up into lumps, and placed in a retort with 20 parts of fuming sulphuric
acid, it gives rise to a violent reaction, accompanied by the formation of brown
fumes of <i>chromic chloranhydride</i>, or <i>chromyl chloride</i>, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, according to the reaction:
CrO<sub>3</sub> + 2NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. The addition of an excess of
sulphuric acid is necessary in order to retain the water. The same substance is always
formed when a metallic chloride is heated with chromic acid, or any of its salts, in the
presence of sulphuric acid. The formation of this volatile substance is easily observed
from the brown colour which is proper to its vapour. On condensing the vapour in a
dry receiver a liquid is obtained having a sp. gr. of 1·9, boiling at 118°, and giving a
vapour whose density, compared with hydrogen, is 78, which corresponds with the above
formula. Chromyl chloride is decomposed by heat into chromic oxide, oxygen, and
chlorine: 2CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> = Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2Cl<sub>2</sub> + O; so that it is able to act simultaneously as a
powerful oxidising and chlorinating agent, which is taken advantage of in the investigation
of many, and especially of organic, substances. When treated with water, this
substance first falls to the bottom, and is then decomposed into hydrochloric and chromic
acids, like all chloranhydrides: CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = CrO<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl. When brought into contact
with inflammable substances it sets fire to them; it acts thus, for instance, on
phosphorus, sulphur, oil of turpentine, ammonia, hydrogen, and other substances. It
attracts moisture from the atmosphere with great energy, and must therefore be kept in
closed vessels. It dissolves iodine and chlorine, and even forms a solid compound with
the latter, which depends upon the faculty of chromium to form its higher oxide,
Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. The close analogy in the physical properties of the chloranhydrides, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and
SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, is very remarkable, although sulphurous anhydride is a gas, and the corresponding
oxide, CrO<sub>2</sub>, is a non-volatile solid. It may be imagined, therefore, that chromium dioxide
(which will be mentioned in the following note) presents a polymerised modification
of the substance having the composition CrO<sub>2</sub>; in fact, this is obvious from the method
of its formation.</p>

<p>If three parts of potassium dichromate be mixed with four parts of strong hydrochloric
acid and a small quantity of water, and gently warmed, it all passes into solution,
and no chlorine is evolved; on cooling, the liquid deposits red prismatic crystals, known
as <i>Peligot's salt</i>, very stable in air. This has the composition KCl,CrO<sub>3</sub>, and is formed
according to the equation K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + 2HCl = 2KCl,CrO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. It is evident that this
is the first chloranhydride of chromic acid, HCrO<sub>3</sub>Cl, in which the hydrogen is replaced
by potassium. It is decomposed by water, and on evaporation the solution yields
potassium dichromate and hydrochloric acid. This is a fresh instance of the reversible
reactions so frequently encountered. With sulphuric acid Peligot's salt forms chromyl
chloride. The latter circumstance, and the fact that Geuther produced Peligot's salt
from potassium chromate and chromyl chloride, give reason for thinking that it is a
compound of these two substances: 2KCl,CrO<sub>3</sub> = K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> + CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. It is also sometimes
regarded as potassium dichromate in which one atom of oxygen is replaced by chlorine&mdash;that
is, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, corresponding with K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. When heated it parts with all its
chlorine, and on further heating gives chromic oxide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_373" id="Footnote_6_373"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_373"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This intermediate degree of oxidation, CrO<sub>2</sub>, may also be obtained by mixing solutions
of chromic salts with solutions of chromates. The brown precipitate formed
contains a compound, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,CrO<sub>3</sub>, consisting of equivalent amounts of chromic oxide
and anhydride. The brown precipitate of chromium dioxide contains water. The same
substance is formed by the imperfect deoxidation of chromic anhydride by various reducing
agents. Chromic oxide, when heated, absorbs oxygen, and appears to give the same
substance. Chromic nitrate, when ignited, also gives this substance. When this substance
is heated it first disengages water and then oxygen, chromic oxide being left. It
corresponds with manganese dioxide, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,CrO<sub>3</sub> = 3CrO<sub>2</sub>. Krüger treated chromium
dioxide with a mixture of sodium chloride and sulphuric acid, and found that chlorine
gas was evolved, but that chromyl chloride was not formed. Under the action of light,
a solution of chromic acid also deposits the brown dioxide. At the ordinary temperature
chromic anhydride leaves a brown stain upon the skin and tissues, which probably proceeds
from a decomposition of the same kind. Chromic anhydride is soluble in alcohol
containing water, and this solution is decomposed in a similar manner by light.
Chromium dioxide forms K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> when treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of KHO.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_BIS_374" id="Footnote_6_BIS_374"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_BIS_374"><span class="label">[6 bis]</span></a> Now that persulphuric acid H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> is well known it might be supposed that
perchromic anhydride, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, would correspond to perchromic acid, H<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, but as yet
it is not certain whether corresponding salts are formed. Péchard (1891) on adding an
excess of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and baryta water to a dilute solution of CrO<sub>2</sub> (8 grm. per litre), observed
the formation of a yellow precipitate, but oxygen was disengaged at the same time and
the precipitate (which easily exploded when dried) was found to contain, besides an
admixture of BaO<sub>2</sub>, a compound BaCrO<sub>5</sub>, and this = BaO<sub>2</sub> + CrO<sub>3</sub>, and does not correspond
to perchromic acid. The fact of its decomposing with an explosion, and the mode of its
preparation, proves, however, that this is a similar derivative of peroxide of hydrogen to
persulphuric acid (Chapter <a href="#Page_200">XX.</a>)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_375" id="Footnote_7_375"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_375"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> As a mixture of potassium dichromate and sulphuric acid is usually employed
for oxidation, the resultant solution generally contains a double sulphate of potassium
and chromium&mdash;that is, <i>chrome alum</i>, isomorphous with ordinary alum&mdash;K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
+ 4H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 20H<sub>2</sub>O = O<sub>3</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>,24H<sub>2</sub>O or 2(KCr(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O). It is prepared
by dissolving potassium dichromate in dilute sulphuric acid; alcohol is then added
and the solution slightly heated, or sulphurous anhydride is passed through it. On the
addition of alcohol to a cold mixture of potassium dichromate and sulphuric acid, the
gradual disengagement of pleasant-smelling volatile products of the oxidation of alcohol,
and especially of aldehyde, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, is remarked. If the temperature of decomposition
does not exceed 35°, a <i>violet</i> solution of chrome alum is obtained, but if the temperature
be higher, a solution of the same alum is obtained of a <i>green</i> colour. As chrome
alum requires for solution 7 parts of water at the ordinary temperature, it follows that if
a somewhat strong solution of potassium dichromate be taken (4 parts of water and 1&frac12;
of sulphuric acid to 1 part of dichromate), it will give so concentrated a solution
of chrome alum that on cooling, the salt will separate without further evaporation. <i>If
the liquid</i>, prepared as above or in any instance of the deoxidation of chromic acid,
<i>be heated</i> (the oxidation naturally proceeds more rapidly) somewhat strongly, for instance,
to the boiling-point of water, or if the violet solution already formed be raised to
the same temperature, it acquires a bright <i>green colour</i>, and on evaporation the
same mixture, which at lower temperatures so easily gives cubical crystals of chrome
alum, <i>does not give any crystals whatever</i>. <i>If the green solution be kept</i>, however, <i>for
several weeks</i> at the ordinary temperature, it deposits <i>violet crystals</i> of chrome alum.
The green solution, when evaporated, gives a non-crystalline mass, and the violet
crystals lose water at 100° and turn green. It must be remarked that the transition of
the green modification into the violet is accompanied by a decrease in volume (Lecoq de
Boisbaudran, Favre). If the green mass formed at the higher temperature be evaporated
to dryness and heated at 30° in a current of air, it does not retain more then 6 equivalents
of water. Hence Löwel, and also Schrötter, concluded that the green and violet
modifications of the alum depend on different degrees of combination with water, which
may be likened to the different compounds of sodium sulphate with water and to the
different hydrates of ferric oxide.</p>

<p>However, the question in this case is not so simple, as we shall afterwards see.
Not chrome alum alone, but <i>all the chromic salts</i>, give two, if not three, <i>varieties</i>. At
least, there is no doubt about the existence of two&mdash;a <i>green</i> and a <i>violet modification</i>.
The green chromic salts are obtained by heating solutions of the violet salts, the violet
solutions are produced on keeping solutions of the green salts for a long time. The conversion
of the violet salts into green by the action of heat is itself an indication of the
possibility of explaining the different modifications by their containing different proportions
(or states) of water, and, moreover, by the green salts having a less amount of
water than the violet. However, there are other explanations. Chromic oxide is a base
like alumina, and is therefore able to give both acid and basic salts. It is supposed that
the difference between the green and violet salts is due to this fact. This opinion of
Krüger is based on the fact that alcohol separates out a salt from the green solution
which contains less sulphuric acid than the normal violet salt. On the other hand,
Löwel showed that all the acid cannot be separated from the green chromic salts by
suitable reagents, as easily as it can be from the same solution of the violet salts; thus
barium salts do not precipitate all the sulphuric acid from solutions of the green salts.
According to other researches the cause of the varieties of the chromic salts lies in a
difference in the bases they contain&mdash;that is, it is connected with a modification of the
properties of the oxide of chromium itself. This only refers to the hydroxides, but as
hydroxides themselves are only special forms of salts, the differences observed as yet
in this direction between the hydroxides only confirm the generality of the difference
observed in the chromic compounds (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_376">7 bis</a>).</p>

<p>The salts of chromic oxide, like those of alumina, are easily decomposed, give basic
and double salts, and have an acid reaction, as chromic oxide is a feeble base. Potassium
and sodium hydroxides give a <i>precipitate</i> of the hydroxide with chromic salts,
CrX<sub>3</sub>. The violet and green salts give a <i>hydroxide soluble in an excess of the
reagent</i>; but the hydroxide is held in solution by very feeble affinities, so that it is
partially separated by heat and dilution with water, and completely so on boiling.
In an alkaline solution, chromic hydroxide is easily converted into chromic acid
by the action of lead dioxide, chlorine, and other oxidising agents. If the chromic
oxide occurs together with such oxides as magnesia, or zinc oxide, then on precipitation
it separates out from its solution in combination with these oxides, forming, for example,
ZnO,Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Viard obtained compounds of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with the oxides of Mg, Zn, Cd, &amp;c.)
On precipitating the violet solution of chrome alum with ammonia, a precipitate containing
Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O is obtained, whilst the precipitate from the boiling solution with caustic
potash was a hydrate containing four equivalents of water. When fused with borax chromic
salts give a green glass. The same coloration is communicated to ordinary glass by the
presence of traces of chromic oxide. A chrome glass containing a large amount of
chromic oxide may be ground up and used as a green pigment. Among the hydrates
of oxide of chromium <i>Guignet's green</i> forms one of the widely-used green pigments which
have been substituted for the poisonous arsenical copper pigments, such as Schweinfurt
green, which formerly was much used. Guignet's green has an extremely bright green
colour, and is distinguished for its great stability, not only under the action of light but
also towards reagents; thus it is not altered by alkaline solutions, and even nitric acid
does not act on it. This pigment remains unchanged up to a temperature of 250°; it
contains Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and generally a small amount of alkali. It is prepared by fusing 3
parts of boric acid with 1 part of potassium dichromate; oxygen is disengaged, and a
green glass, containing a mixture of the borates of chromium and potassium, is obtained.
When cool this glass is ground up and treated with water, which extracts the boric
acid and alkali and leaves the above-named chromic hydroxide behind. This hydroxide
only parts with its water at a red heat, leaving the anhydrous oxide.</p>

<p>The chromic hydroxides lose their water by ignition, and in so doing become spontaneously
incandescent, like the ordinary ferric hydroxide (Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII.</a>). It is not
known, however, whether all the modifications of chromic oxide show this phenomenon.
The anhydrous <i>chromic oxide</i>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is exceedingly difficultly soluble in acids, if it
has passed through the above recalescence. But if it has parted with its water, or the
greater part of it, and not yet undergone this self-induced incandescence (has not lost a
portion of its energy), then it is soluble in acids. It is not reduced by hydrogen. It is
easily obtained in various crystalline forms by many methods. The chromates of mercury
and ammonium give a very convenient method for its preparation, because when
ignited they leave chromic oxide behind. In the first instance oxygen and mercury are
disengaged, and in the second case nitrogen and water: 2Hg<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> = Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>5</sub> + 4Hg or
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> = Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>. The second reaction is very energetic, and the mass
of salt burns spontaneously if the temperature be sufficiently high. A mixture of potassium
sulphate and chromic oxide is formed by heating potassium dichromate with an
equal weight of sulphur: K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + S = K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The sulphate is easily extracted
by water, and there remains a bright green residue of the oxide, whose colour is more
brilliant the lower the temperature of the decomposition. The oxide thus obtained is
used as a green pigment for china and enamel. The anhydrous chromic oxide obtained
from chromyl chloride, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, has a specific gravity of 5·21, and forms almost black
crystals, which give a green powder. They are hard enough to scratch glass, and have a
metallic lustre. The crystalline form of chromic oxide is identical with that of the oxide
of iron and alumina, with which it is isomorphous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_BIS_376" id="Footnote_7_BIS_376"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_BIS_376"><span class="label">[7 bis]</span></a> The most important of the compounds corresponding with chromic oxide is <i>chromic
chloride</i>, Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, which is known in an anhydrous and in a hydrated form. It resembles
ferric and aluminic chlorides in many respects. There is a great difference between
the anhydrous and the hydrated chlorides; the former is insoluble in water, the latter
easily dissolves, and on evaporation its solution forms a hygroscopic mass which is very
unstable and easily evolves hydrochloric acid when heated with water. The anhydrous
form is of a violet colour, and Wöhler gives the following method for its preparation: an
intimate mixture is prepared of the anhydrous chromic oxide with carbon and organic
matter, and charged into a wide infusible glass or porcelain tube which is heated in a
combustion furnace; one extremity of the tube communicates with an apparatus generating
chlorine which is passed through several bottles containing sulphuric acid in order
to dry it perfectly before it reaches the tube. On heating the portion of the tube in
which the mixture is placed and passing chlorine through, a slightly volatile sublimate of
chromic chloride, CrCl<sub>3</sub> or Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, is formed. This substance forms <i>violet tabular
crystals</i>, which may be distilled in dry chlorine without change, but which, however, require
a red heat for their volatilisation. These crystals are greasy to the touch and insoluble
in water, but if they be powdered and boiled in water for a long time they pass
into <i>a green solution</i>. Strong sulphuric acid does not act on the anhydrous salt, or
only acts with exceeding slowness, like water. Even aqua regia and other acids do not
act on the crystals, and alkalis only show a very feeble action. The specific gravity of
the crystals is 2·99. When fused with sodium carbonate and nitre they give sodium
chloride and potassium chromate, and when ignited in air they form green chromic oxide
and evolve chlorine. On ignition in a stream of ammonia, chromic chloride forms
sal-ammoniac and chromium nitride, CrN (analogous to the nitrides BN, AlN). Mosberg and
Peligot showed that when chromic chloride is ignited in hydrogen, it parts with one-third
of its chlorine, forming chromous chloride, CrCl<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that is, there is formed from a compound
corresponding with chromic oxide, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, a compound answering to the <i>suboxide</i>,
chromous oxide, CrO&mdash;just as hydrogen converts ferric chloride into ferrous chloride with
the aid of heat. <i>Chromous chloride</i>, CrCl<sub>2</sub>, forms colourless crystals easily soluble in
water, which in dissolving evolve a considerable amount of heat, and form a blue liquid,
capable of absorbing oxygen from the air with great facility, being converted thereby
into a chromic compound.</p>

<p>The blue solution of chromous chloride may also be obtained by the action of metallic
zinc on the green solution of the hydrated chromic chloride; the zinc in this case takes
up chlorine just as the hydrogen did. It must be employed in a large excess. Chromic
oxide is also formed in the action of zinc on chromic chloride, and if the solution remain
for a long time in contact with the zinc the whole of the chromium is converted into
chromic oxychloride. Other chromic salts are also reduced by zinc into <i>chromous salts</i>,
CrX<sub>2</sub>, just as the ferric salts FeX<sub>3</sub> are converted into ferrous salts FeX<sub>2</sub> by it. The
chromous salts are exceedingly unstable and easily oxidise and pass into chromic salts;
hence the reducing power of these salts is very great. From cupric salts they separate
cuprous salts, from stannous salts they precipitate metallic tin, they reduce mercuric
salts into mercurous and ferric into ferrous salts. Moreover, they absorb oxygen from
the air directly. With potassium chromate they give a brown precipitate of chromium
dioxide or of chromic oxide, according to the relative amounts of the substances taken:
CrO<sub>3</sub> + CrO = 2CrO<sub>2</sub> or CrO<sub>3</sub> + 3CrO = 2Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Aqueous ammonia gives a blue precipitate,
and in the presence of ammoniacal salts a blue liquid is obtained which turns red
in the air from oxidation. This is accompanied by the formation of compounds analogous
to those given by cobalt (Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII.</a>). A solution of chromous chloride with a
hot saturated solution of sodium acetate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>NaO<sub>2</sub>, gives, on cooling, transparent red
crystals of chromous acetate, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. This salt is also a powerful reducing
agent, but may be kept for a long time in a vessel full of carbonic anhydride.</p>

<p>The insoluble anhydrous <i>chromic chloride</i> CrCl<sub>3</sub> very easily <i>passes into solution</i> in
the presence of a trace (0·004) of <i>chromous chloride</i> CrCl<sub>2</sub>. This remarkable phenomenon
was observed by Peligot and explained by Löwel in the following manner:
chromous chloride, as a lower stage of oxidation, is capable of absorbing both oxygen
and chlorine, combining with various substances. It is able to decompose many
chlorides by taking up chlorine from them; thus it precipitates mercurous chloride from
a solution of mercuric chloride, and in so doing passes into chromic chloride: 2CrCl<sub>2</sub>
+ 2HgCl<sub>2</sub> = Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 2HgCl. Let us suppose that the same phenomenon takes place
when the anhydrous chromic chloride is mixed with a solution of chromous chloride.
The latter will then take up a portion of the chlorine of the former, and pass into a
soluble hydrate of chromic chloride (hydrochloride of oxide of chromium), and the
original anhydrous chromic chloride will pass into chromous chloride. The chromous
chloride re-formed in this manner will then act on a fresh quantity of the chromic
chloride, and in this manner transfer it entirely into solution as hydrate. This view is
confirmed by the fact that other chlorides, capable of absorbing chlorine like chromous
chloride, also induce the solution of the insoluble chromic chloride&mdash;for example, ferrous
chloride, FeCl<sub>2</sub>, and cuprous chloride. The presence of zinc also aids the solution of
chromic chloride, owing to its converting a portion of it into chromous chloride. The
solution of chromic chloride in water obtained by these methods is perfectly identical
with that which is formed by dissolving chromic hydroxide in hydrochloric acid. On
evaporating the <i>green solution</i> obtained in this manner, it gives a green mass, containing
water. On further heating it leaves a soluble chromic oxychloride, and when
ignited it first forms an insoluble oxychloride and then chromic oxide; but no anhydrous
chromic chloride, Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, is formed by heating the aqueous solution of chromic
chloride, which forms an important fact in support of the view that the green solution
of chromic chloride is nothing else but hydrochloride of oxide of chromium. At
100° the composition of the green hydrate is Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O, and on evaporation at the
ordinary temperature over H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> crystals are obtained with 12 equivalents of water;
the red mass obtained at 120° contains Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,4Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,24H<sub>2</sub>O. The greater portion of
it is soluble in water, like the mass which is formed at 150°. The latter contains
Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O = 3(Cr<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O)&mdash;that is, it presents the same composition as
chromic chloride in which one atom of oxygen replaces two of chlorine. And if the
hydrate of chromic chloride be regarded as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,6HCl, the substance which is obtained
should be regarded as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,4HCl combined with water, H<sub>2</sub>O. The addition
of alkalis&mdash;for example, baryta&mdash;to a solution of chromic chloride immediately produces
a precipitate, which, however, re-dissolves on shaking, owing to the formation of one of
the oxychlorides just mentioned, which may be regarded as <i>basic salts</i>. Thus we may
represent the product of the change produced on chromic chloride under the influence
of water and heat by the following formulæ: first Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,6HCl or Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O is formed,
then Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,4HCl,H<sub>2</sub>O or Cr<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, and lastly Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2HCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O or Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O.
In all three cases there are 2 equivalents of chromium to at least 3 equivalents of
water. These compounds may be regarded as being intermediate between chromic
hydroxide and chloride; chromic chloride is Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, the first oxychloride Cr<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>,
the second Cr<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, and the hydrate Cr<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>&mdash;that is, the chlorine is replaced by
hydroxyl.</p>

<p>It is very important to remark two circumstances in respect to this: (1) That the
whole of the chlorine in the above compounds is not precipitated from their solutions
by silver nitrate; thus the normal salt of the composition Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O only gives up
two-thirds of its chlorine; therefore Peligot supposes that the normal salt contains the
oxychloride combined with hydrochloric acid: Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,4HCl, and that
the chlorine held as hydrochloric acid reacts with the silver, whilst that held in the
oxychloride does not enter into reaction, just as we observe a very feebly-developed
faculty for reaction in the anhydrous chromic chloride; and (2) if the green aqueous
solution of CrCl<sub>3</sub> be left to stand for some time, it ultimately turns violet; in this form
the whole of the chlorine is precipitated by AgNO<sub>3</sub>, whilst boiling re-converts it into the
green variety. Löwel obtained the violet solution of hydrochloride of chromic oxide by
decomposing the violet chromic sulphate with barium chloride. Silver nitrate precipitates
all the chlorine from this violet modification; but if the violet solution be boiled
and so converted into the green modification, silver nitrate then only precipitates a portion
of the chlorine.</p>

<p>Recoura (1890&ndash;1893) obtained a crystallohydrate of violet chromium sulphate,
Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, with 18 or 15 H<sub>2</sub>O. By boiling a solution of this crystallohydrate, he
converted it into the green salt, which, when treated with alkalis, gave a precipitate
of Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, soluble in 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (and not 3), and only forming the basic salt,
Cr<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. He therefore concludes that the green salts are basic salts. The
cryoscopic determinations made by A. Speransky (1892) and Marchetti (1892) give a
greater &lsquo;depression&rsquo; for the violet than the green salts, that is, indicate a greater
molecular weight for the green salts. But as Étard, by heating the violet sulphate to
100°, converted it into a green salt of the same composition, but with a smaller amount
of H<sub>2</sub>O, it follows that the formation of a basic salt alone is insufficient to explain the
difference between the green and violet varieties, and this is also shown by the fact that
BaCl<sub>2</sub> precipitates the whole of the sulphuric acid of the violet salt, and only a portion
of that of the green salt. A. Speransky also showed that the molecular electro-conductivity
of the green solutions is less than that of the violet. It is also known that
the passage of the former into the latter is accompanied by an increase of volume, and,
according to Recoura, by an evolution of heat also.</p>

<p>Piccini's researches (1894) throw an important light upon the peculiarities of the
green chromium trichloride (or chromic chloride); he showed (1) that AgF (in contradistinction
to the other salts of silver) precipitates all the chlorine from an aqueous
solution of the green variety; (2) that solutions of green CrCl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O in ethyl alcohol
and acetone precipitate all their chlorine when mixed with a similar solution of AgNO<sub>3</sub>;
(3) that the rise of the boiling-point of the ethyl alcohol and acetone green solutions of
CrCl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O (Chapter VII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_27_BIS_437">27 bis</a>) shows that i in this case (as in the aqueous solutions
of MgSO<sub>4</sub> and HgCl<sub>2</sub>) is nearly equal to 1, that is, that they are like solutions of
non-conductors; (4) that a solution of green CrCl<sub>3</sub> in methyl alcohol at first precipitates
about &#8542; of its chlorine (an aqueous solution about &#8532;) when treated with AgNO<sub>3</sub>, but
after a time the whole of the chlorine is precipitated; and (5) that an aqueous solution
of the green variety gradually passes into the violet, while a methyl alcoholic solution
preserves its green colour, both of itself and also after the whole of the chlorine has
been precipitated by AgNO<sub>3</sub>. If, however, in an aqueous or methyl alcoholic solution
only a portion of the chlorine be precipitated, the solution gradually turns violet.
In my opinion the general meaning of all these observations requires further elucidation
and explanation, which should be in harmony with the theory of solutions. Recoura,
moreover, obtained compounds of the green salt, Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, with 1, 2, and 3 molecules of
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and even a compound Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>. By neutralising the sulphuric
acid of the compounds of Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with caustic soda, Recoura obtained an
evolution of 33 thousand calories per each 2NaHO, while free H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> only gives 30·8
thousand calories. Recoura is of opinion that special <i>chromo sulphuric acids</i>, for
instance (CrSO<sub>4</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = &frac12;Cr<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, are formed. With a still larger excess of
sulphuric acid, Recoura obtained salts containing a still greater number of sulphuric
acid radicles, but even this method does not explain the difference between the green and
violet salts.</p>

<p>These facts must naturally be taken into consideration in order to arrive at
any complete decision as to the cause of the different modifications of the chromic salts.
We may observe that the green modification of chromic chloride does not give double
salts with the metallic chlorides, whilst the violet variety forms compounds Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,2RCl
(where R = an alkali metal), which are obtained by heating the chromates with an excess
of hydrochloric acid and evaporating the solution until it acquires a violet colour. As
the result of all the existing researches on the green and violet chromic salts, it appears
to me most probable that their difference is determined by the feeble basic character of
chromic oxide, by its faculty of giving basic salts, and by the colloidal properties of its
hydroxide (these three properties are mutually connected), and moreover, it seems to me
that the relation between the green and violet salts of chromic oxide best answers to the
relation of the purpureo to the luteo cobaltic salts (Chapter XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_35_445">35</a>). This
subject cannot yet be considered as exhausted (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_7_375">7</a>).</p>

<p>We may here observe that with tin the chromic salts, CrX<sub>3</sub>, give at low temperatures
CrX<sub>2</sub> and SnX<sub>2</sub>, whilst at high temperatures, on the contrary, CrX<sub>2</sub> reduces the metal
from its salts SnX<sub>2</sub>. The reaction, therefore, belongs to the class of reversible reactions
(Beketoff).</p>

<p>Poulenc obtained anhydrous CrF<sub>3</sub> (sp. gr. 3·78) and CrF<sub>2</sub> (sp. gr. 4·11) by the
action of gaseous HF upon CrCl<sub>2</sub>. A solution of fluoride of chromium is employed as a
mordant in dyeing. Recoura (1890) obtained green and violet varieties of Cr<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>6</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O.
The green variety can only be kept in the presence of an excess of HBr in the solution;
if alone its solution easily passes into the violet variety with evolution of heat.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_377" id="Footnote_8_377"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_377"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The reduction of metallic chromium proceeds with comparative ease in aqueous
solutions. Thus the action of sodium amalgams upon a strong solution of Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> gives
(first CrCl<sub>2</sub>) an amalgam of chromium from which the mercury may be easily driven off
by heating (in hydrogen to avoid oxidation), and there remains a spongy mass of easily
oxidizable chromium. Plaset (1891), by passing an electric current through a solution of
chrome alum mixed with a small amount of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, obtained hard scales of
chromium of a bluish-white colour possessing great hardness and stability (under the
action of water, air, and acids). Glatzel (1890) reduced a mixture of 2KCl + Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> by
heating it to redness with shavings of magnesium. The metallic chromium thus
obtained has the appearance of a fine light-grey powder which is seen to be crystalline
under the microscope; its sp. gr. at 16° is 6·7284. It fuses (with anhydrous borax) only at
the highest temperatures, and after fusion presents a silver-white fracture. The strongest
magnet has no action upon it.</p>

<p>Moissan (1893) obtained chromium by reducing the oxide Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with carbon in the
electrical furnace (Chapter VIII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_17_796">17</a>) in 9&ndash;10 minutes with a current of 350 ampères and
50 volts. The mixture of oxide and carbon gives a bright ingot weighing 100&ndash;110 grams.
A current of 100 ampères and 50 volts completes the experiment upon a smaller quantity
of material in 15 minutes; a current of 30 ampères and 50 volts gave an ingot of 10 grams
in 30&ndash;40 minutes. The resultant carbon alloy is more or less rich in chromium
(from 87·37&ndash;91·7 p.c.). To obtain the metal free from carbon, the alloy is broken into
large lumps, mixed with oxide of chromium, put into a crucible and covered with a
layer of oxide. This mixture is then heated in the electric furnace and the pure metal
is obtained. This reduction can also be carried on with chrome iron ore FeOCr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
which occurs in nature. In this case a homogeneous alloy of iron and chromium
is obtained. If this alloy be thrown in lumps into molten nitre, it forms insoluble
sesquioxide of iron and a soluble alkaline chromate. This alloy of iron and
chromium dissolved in molten steel (chrome steel) renders it hard and tough, so that
such steel has many valuable applications. The alloy, containing about 3 p.c. Cr and
about 1·3 p.c. carbon, is even harder than the ordinary kinds of tempered steel and has a
fine granular fracture. The usual mode of preparing the ferrochromes for adding to
steel is by fusing powdered chrome iron ore under fluxes in a graphite crucible.</p></div>

being identical with that of the compounds of sulphur and chromium, because (1) both
these metals give two oxides in which the amounts of oxygen per given amount of metal
stand in the ratio 2 : 3; (2) the higher oxide is of the latter kind, and, like chromic
and sulphuric anhydrides, it has an acid character; (3) certain of the molybdates are isomorphous
with the sulphates; (4) the specific heat of tungsten is 0·0334, consequently
the product of the atomic weight and specific heat is 6·15, like that of the other elements&mdash;it
is the same with molybdenum, 96·0 × 0·0722 = 6·9; (5) tungsten forms with chlorine
not only compounds WCl<sub>6</sub>, WCl<sub>5</sub>, and WOCl<sub>4</sub>, but also WO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, a volatile substance the
analogue of chromyl chloride, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, and sulphuryl chloride, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>. Molybdenum
gives the chlorine compounds, MOCl<sub>2</sub>, MOCl<sub>3</sub>(?), MOCl<sub>4</sub> (fuses at 194°, boils at 268°;
according to Debray it contains MOCl<sub>5</sub>), MoOCl<sub>4</sub>, MoO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, and MoO<sub>2</sub>(OH)Cl. The
existence of tungsten hexachloride, WCl<sub>6</sub>, is an excellent proof of the fact that the type
SX<sub>6</sub> appears in the analogues of sulphur as in SO<sub>3</sub>; (6) the vapour density accurately
determined for the chlorine compounds MoCl<sub>4</sub>, WCl<sub>6</sub>, WCl<sub>5</sub>, WOCl<sub>4</sub> (Roscoe) leaves no
doubt as to the molecular composition of the compounds of tungsten and molybdenum,
for the observed and calculated results entirely agree.</p>

<p>Tungsten is sometimes called scheele in honour of Scheele, who discovered it in 1781
and molybdenum in 1778. Tungsten is also known as wolfram; the former name was the
name given to it by Scheele, because he extracted it from the mineral then known as
tungsten and now called scheelite, CaWO<sub>4</sub>. The researches of Roscoe, Blomstrand and
others have subsequently thrown considerable light on the whole history of the compounds
of molybdenum and tungsten.</p>

<p>The ammonium salts of tungsten and molybdic acids when ignited leave the anhydrides,
which resemble each other in many respects. <i>Tungsten anhydride</i>, WO<sub>3</sub>, is a
yellowish substance, which only fuses at a strong heat, and has a sp. gr. of 6·8. It is
insoluble both in water and acid, but solutions of the alkalis, and even of the alkali carbonates,
dissolve it, especially when heated, forming alkaline salts. <i>Molybdic anhydride</i>,
MoO<sub>3</sub>, is obtained by igniting the acid (hydrate) or the ammonium salt, and forms a
white mass which fuses at a red heat, and solidifies to a yellow crystalline mass of sp. gr.
4·4; whilst on further heating in open vessels or in a stream of air this anhydride
<i>sublimes</i> in pearly scales&mdash;this enables it to be obtained in a tolerably pure state. Water
dissolves it in small quantities&mdash;namely, 1 part requires 600 parts of water for its solution.
The hydrates of molybdic anhydride are <i>soluble also in acids</i> (a hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>, is
obtained from the nitric acid solution of the ammonium salt), which forms one of their
distinctions from the tungstic acids. But after ignition molybdic anhydride is insoluble
in acids, like tungstic anhydride; alkalis dissolve this anhydride, easily forming molybdates.
Potassium bitartrate dissolves the anhydride with the aid of heat. None of the acids
yet considered by us form so many different salts with one and the same base (alkali) as
molybdic and tungstic acids. The composition of these salts, and their properties also,
vary considerably. The most important discovery in this respect was made by Marguerite
and Laurent, who showed that the salts which contain a large proportion of tungstic
acid are easily soluble in water, and ascribed this property to the fact that tungstic acid
may be obtained <i>in several states</i>. The common tungstates, obtained with an excess of
alkali, have an alkaline reaction, and on the addition of sulphuric or hydrochloric acid
first deposit an acid salt and then a hydrate of tungstic acid, which is insoluble both in
water and acids; but if instead of sulphuric or hydrochloric acids, we add acetic or phosphoric
acid, or if the tungstate be saturated with a fresh quantity of tungstic acid, which
may be done by boiling the solution of the alkali salt with the precipitated tungstic acid,
a solution is obtained which, on the addition of sulphuric or a similar acid, does not
give a precipitate of tungstic acid at the ordinary or at higher temperatures. The solution
then contains peculiar salts of tungstic acid, and if there be an excess of acid it also
contains tungstic acid itself; Laurent, Riche, and others called it <i>metatungstic acid</i>, and
it is still known by this name. Those salts which with acids immediately give the insoluble
tungstic acid have the composition R<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>,RHWO<sub>4</sub>, whilst those which give
the soluble metatungstic acid contain a far greater proportion of the acid elements.
Scheibler obtained the (soluble) metatungstic acid itself by treating the soluble barium
(meta) tetratungstate, BaO,4WO<sub>3</sub>, with sulphuric acid. Subsequent research showed the
existence of a similar phenomenon for molybdic acid. There is no doubt that this is a
case of colloidal modifications.</p>

<p>Many chemists have worked on the various salts formed by molybdic and tungstic
acids. The tungstates have been investigated by Marguerite, Laurent, Marignac,
Riche, Scheibler, Anthon, and others. The molybdates were partially studied by the
same chemists, but chiefly by Struvé and Svanberg, Delafontaine, and others. It appears
that for a given amount of base the salts contain one to eight equivalents of molybdic or
tungstic anhydride; <i>i.e.</i> if the base have the composition RO, then the highest proportion
of base will be contained by the salts of the composition ROWO<sub>3</sub> or ROMoO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, by
those salts which correspond with the normal acids H<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>, of the same nature
as sulphuric acid; but there also exist salts of the composition RO,2WO<sub>3</sub>, RO,3WO<sub>3</sub> &hellip;
RO,8WO<sub>3</sub>. The water contained in the composition of many of the acid salts is often
not taken into account in the above. The properties of the salts holding different proportions
of acids vary considerably, but one salt may be converted into another by the
addition of acid or base with great facility, and the greater the proportion of the elements
of the acid in a salt, the more stable, within a certain limit, is its solution and the salt
itself.</p>

<p>The most common ammonium molybdate has the composition (NH<sub>4</sub>HO)<sub>6</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,7MoO<sub>3</sub>
(or, according to Marignac and others, NH<sub>4</sub>HMoO<sub>4</sub>), and is prepared by evaporating an
ammoniacal solution of molybdic acid. It is used in the laboratory for precipitating
phosphoric acid, and is purified for this purpose by mixing its solution with a small
quantity of magnesium nitrate, in order to precipitate any phosphoric acid present, filtering,
and then adding nitric acid and evaporating to dryness. A pure ammonium molybdate
free from phosphoric acid may then be extracted from the residue.</p>

<p>Phosphoric acid forms insoluble compounds with the oxides of uranium and iron,
tin, bismuth, &amp;c., having feeble basic and even acid properties. This perhaps depends
on the fact that the atoms of hydrogen in phosphoric acid are of a very different
character, as we saw above. Those atoms of hydrogen which are replaced with difficulty
by ammonium, sodium, &amp;c., are probably easily replaced by feebly energetic acid
groups&mdash;that is, the formation of particular complex substances may be expected to
take place at the expense of these atoms of the hydrogen of phosphoric acid and of
certain feeble metallic acids; and these substances will still be acids, because the
hydrogen of the phosphoric acids and metallic acids, which is easily replaced by metals,
is not removed by their mutual combination, but remains in the resultant compound.
Such a conclusion is verified in the <i>phosphomolybdic acids</i> obtained (1888) by Debray.
If a solution of ammonium molybdate be acidified, and a small amount of a solution (it
may be acid) containing orthophosphoric acid or its salts be added to it (so that there are
at least 40 parts of molybdic acid present to 1 part of phosphoric acid), then after a period
of twenty-four hours the whole of the phosphoric acid is separated as a yellow precipitate,
containing, however, not more than 3 to 4 p.c. of phosphoric anhydride, about 3 p.c. of
ammonia, about 90 p.c. of molybdic anhydride, and about 4 p.c. of water. The formation
of this precipitate is so distinct and so complete that this method is employed for the discovery
and separation of the smallest quantities of phosphoric acid. Phosphoric acid was
found to be present in the majority of rocks by this means. The precipitate is soluble
in ammonia and its salts, in alkalis and phosphates, but is perfectly insoluble in nitric,
sulphuric, and hydrochloric acids in the presence of ammonium molybdate. The composition
of the precipitate appears to vary under the conditions of its precipitation, but its
nature became clear when the acid corresponding with it was obtained. If the above-described
yellow precipitate be boiled in aqua regia, the ammonia is destroyed, and
an acid is obtained in solution, which, when evaporated in the air, crystallises out in yellow
oblique prisms of approximately the composition P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,20MoO<sub>3</sub>,26H<sub>2</sub>O. Such an unusual
proportion of component parts is explained by the above-mentioned considerations. We
saw above that molybdic acid easily gives salts R<sub>2</sub>O<i>n</i>MoO<sub>3</sub><i>m</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, which we may imagine
to correspond to a hydrate MoO<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>Mo<sub>3</sub><i>m</i>H<sub>2</sub>O. And suppose that such a hydrate
reacts on orthophosphoric acid, forming water and compounds of the composition
MoO<sub>2</sub>(HPO<sub>4</sub>)<i>n</i>MoO<sub>3</sub><i>m</i>H<sub>2</sub>O or MoO<sub>3</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub><i>n</i>MoO<sub>3</sub><i>m</i>H<sub>2</sub>O; this is actually the composition
of phosphomolybdic acid. Probably it contains a portion of the hydrogen replaceable
by metals of both the acids H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and of H<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>. The crystalline acid above is
probably H<sub>3</sub>MoPO<sub>7</sub>,9MoO<sub>3</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O. This acid is really tribasic, because its aqueous
solution precipitates salts of potassium, ammonium, rubidium (but not lithium and
sodium) <i>from acid solutions</i>, and gives a <i>yellow</i> precipitate of the composition
R<sub>3</sub>MoPO<sub>7</sub>,9MoO<sub>3</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O, where R = NH<sub>4</sub>. Besides these, salts of another composition
may be obtained, as would be expected from the preceding. These salts are only stable
in acid solutions (which is naturally due to their containing an excess of acid oxides),
whilst under the action of alkalis they give <i>colourless</i> phosphomolybdates of the composition
R<sub>3</sub>MoPO<sub>3</sub>,MoO<sub>2</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. The corresponding salts of potassium, silver, ammonium,
are easily soluble in water and crystalline.</p>

<p>Phosphomolybdic acid is an example of the <i>complex inorganic acids</i> first obtained
by Marignac and afterwards generalised and studied in detail by Gibbs. We shall
afterwards meet with several examples of such acids, and we will now turn attention to
the fact that they are usually formed by weak polybasic acids (boric, silicic, molybdic,
&amp;c.), and in certain respects resemble the cobaltic and such similar complex compounds,
with which we shall become acquainted in the following chapter. As an example we will
here mention certain complex compounds containing molybdic and tungstic acids, as they
will illustrate the possibility of a considerable complexity in the composition of salts.
The action of ammonium molybdate upon a dilute solution of purpureocobaltic salts (<i>see</i>
Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII</a>.) acidulated with acetic acid gives a salt which after drying at 100° has the
composition Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>10NH<sub>3</sub>7MoO<sub>3</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O. After ignition this salt leaves a residue having the
composition 2CoO<sub>7</sub>MoO<sub>3</sub>. An analogous compound is also obtained for tungstic acid, having
the composition Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>10NH<sub>3</sub>10WO<sub>3</sub>9H<sub>2</sub>O. In this case after ignition there remains a salt
of the composition CoO<sub>5</sub>WO<sub>3</sub> (Carnot, 1889). Professor Kournakoff, by treating a solution of
potassium and sodium molybdates, containing a certain amount of suboxide of cobalt, with
bromine obtained salts having the composition: 3K<sub>2</sub>OCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>12MoO<sub>3</sub>20H<sub>2</sub>O (light green)
and 3K<sub>2</sub>OCo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>10Mo<sub>3</sub>10H<sub>2</sub>O (dark green). Péchard (1893) obtained salts of the four complex
phosphotungstic acids by evaporating equivalent mixtures of solutions of phosphoric acid
and metatungstic acid (<i>see</i> further on): phosphotrimetatungstic acid P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>12WO<sub>3</sub>48H<sub>2</sub>O,
phosphotetrametatungstic acid P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>16WO<sub>3</sub>69H<sub>2</sub>O, phosphopentametatungstic acid
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>20WO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, and phosphohexametatungstic acid P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>24WO<sub>3</sub>59H<sub>2</sub>O. Kehrmann
and Frankel described still more complex salts, such as: 3Ag<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>BaOP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>22WO<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O,5BaO<sub>2</sub>K<sub>2</sub>OP<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>22WO<sub>3</sub>48H<sub>2</sub>O.
Analogous double salts with 22WO<sub>3</sub> were also obtained
with KSr, KHg, BaHg, and NH<sub>4</sub>Pb. Kehrmann (1892) considers the possibility of
obtaining an unlimited number of such salts to be a general characteristic of such compounds.
Mahom and Friedheim (1892) obtained compounds of similar complexity for
molybdic and arsenic acids.</p>

<p>For tungstic acid there are known: (1) Normal salts&mdash;for example, K<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>; (2) the
so-called acid salts have a composition like 3K<sub>2</sub>O,7WO<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O or K<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>7</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O; (3)
the tritungstates like Na<sub>3</sub>O,3WO<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O = Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(WO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. All these three classes of
salts are soluble in water, but are precipitated by barium chloride, and with acids in solution
give an insoluble hydrate of tungstic acid; whilst those salts which are enumerated
below do not give a precipitate either with acids or with the salts of the heavy metals, because
they form soluble salts even with barium and lead. They are generally called metatungstates.
They all contain water and a larger proportion of acid elements than the
preceding salts; (4) the tetratungstates, like Na<sub>2</sub>O,4WO<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O and BaO,4WO<sub>3</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O for
example; (5) the octatungstates&mdash;for example, Na<sub>2</sub>O,8WO<sub>3</sub>,24H<sub>2</sub>O. Since the metatungstates
lose so much water at 100° that they leave salts whose composition corresponds
with an acid, 3H<sub>2</sub>O,4WO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, H<sub>6</sub>W<sub>4</sub>O<sub>15</sub>&mdash;whilst in the meta salts only 2 hydrogens
are replaced by metals, it is assumed, although without much ground, that these salts
contain a particular soluble metatungstic acid of the composition H<sub>6</sub>W<sub>4</sub>O<sub>15</sub>.</p>

<p>As an example we will give a short description of the sodium salts. The normal
salt, Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>, is obtained by heating a strong solution of sodium carbonate with tungstic
acid to a temperature of 80°; if the solution be filtered hot, it crystallises in rhombic
tabular crystals, having the composition Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, which remain unchanged in the
air and are easily soluble in water. When this salt is fused with a fresh quantity of
tungstic acid, it gives a ditungstate, which is soluble in water and separates from its
solution in crystals containing water. The same salt is obtained by carefully adding
hydrochloric acid to the solution of the normal salt so long as a precipitate does not
appear, and the liquid still has an alkaline reaction. This salt was first supposed to
have the composition Na<sub>2</sub>W<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, but it has since been found to contain (at 100°)
Na<sub>6</sub>W<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>,16H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;that is, it corresponds with the similar salt of molybdic acid.</p>

<p>(If this salt be heated to a red heat in a stream of hydrogen, it loses a portion of its
oxygen, acquires a metallic lustre, and turns a golden yellow colour, and, after being
treated with water, alkali, and acid, leaves golden yellow leaflets and cubes which are
very like gold. This very remarkable substance, discovered by Wöhler, has, according
to Malaguti's analysis, the composition Na<sub>2</sub>W<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>; that is, it, as it were, contains a
double tungstate of tungsten oxide, WO<sub>2</sub>, and of sodium, Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>,WO<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>3</sub>. The
decomposition of the fused sodium salt is best effected by finely-divided tin. This substance
has a sp. gr. 6·6; it conducts electricity like metals, and like them has a metallic
lustre. When brought into contact with zinc and sulphuric acid it disengages hydrogen,
and it becomes covered with a coating of copper in a solution of copper sulphate in the
presence of zinc&mdash;that is, notwithstanding its complex composition it presents to a
certain extent the appearance and reactions of the metals. It is not acted on by aqua
regia or alkaline solutions, but it is oxidised when ignited in air.)</p>

<p>The ditungstate mentioned above, deprived of water (having undergone a modification
similar to that of metaphosphoric acid), after being treated with water, leaves an
anhydrous, sparingly soluble tetratungstate, Na<sub>2</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>,3WO<sub>3</sub>, which, when heated at 120°
in a closed tube with water, passes into an easily soluble metatungstate. It may therefore
be said that the metatungstates are hydrated compounds. On boiling a solution of
the above-mentioned salts of sodium with the yellow hydrate of tungstic acid they give
a solution of metatungstate, which is the hydrated tetratungstate. Its crystals contain
Na<sub>2</sub>W<sub>4</sub>O<sub>13</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O. After the hydrate of tungstic acid (obtained from the ordinary tungstates
by precipitation with an acid) has stood a long time in contact with a solution (hot
or cold) of sodium tungstate, it gives a solution which is not precipitated by hydrochloric
acid; this must be filtered and evaporated over sulphuric acid in a desiccator (it is decomposed
by boiling). It first forms a very dense solution (aluminium floats in it) of
sp. gr. 3·0, and octahedral crystals of <i>sodium metatungstate</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>W<sub>4</sub>O<sub>13</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, sp. gr.
3·85, then separate. It effloresces and loses water, and at 100° only two out of the
ten equivalents of water remain, but the properties of the salt remain unaltered. If the
salt be deprived of water by further heating, it becomes insoluble. At the ordinary
temperature one part of water dissolves ten parts of the metatungstate. The other
metatungstates are easily obtained from this salt. Thus a strong and hot solution,
mixed with a like solution of barium chloride, gives on cooling crystals of barium metatungstate,
BaW<sub>4</sub>O<sub>13</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O. These crystals are dissolved without change in water containing
hydrochloric acid, and also in hot water, but they are partially decomposed by
cold water, with the formation of a solution of metatungstic acid and of the normal
barium salt BaWO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>In order to explain the difference in the properties of the salts of tungstic acid, we
may add that a mixture of a solution of tungstic acid with a solution of silicic acid does
not coagulate when heated, although the silicic acid alone would do so; this is due to
the formation of a silicotungstic acid, discovered by Marignac, which presents a fresh
example of a complex acid. A solution of a tungstate dissolves gelatinous silica, just as
it does gelatinous tungstic acid, and when evaporated deposits a crystalline salt of
silicotungstic acid. This solution is not precipitated either by acids (a clear analogy to
the metatungstates) or by sulphuretted hydrogen, and corresponds with a series of salts.
These salts contain one equivalent of silica and 8 equivalents of hydrogen or metals, in
the same form as in salts, to 12 or 10 equivalents of tungstic anhydride; for example
the crystalline potassium salt has the composition K<sub>8</sub>W<sub>12</sub>SiO<sub>42</sub>,14H<sub>2</sub>O = 4K<sub>2</sub>O,12WO<sub>3</sub>,SiO<sub>2</sub>,14H<sub>2</sub>O.
Acid salts are also known in which half of the metal is replaced by
hydrogen. The complexity of the composition of such complex acids (for example, of
the phosphomolybdic acid) involuntarily leads to the idea of polymerisation, which we
were obliged to recognise for silica, lead oxide, and other compounds. This polymerisation,
it seems to me, may be understood thus: a hydrate A (for example, tungstic acid)
is capable of combining with a hydrate B (for example, silica or phosphoric acid, with
or without the disengagement of water), and by reason of this faculty it is capable of
polymerisation&mdash;that is, A combines with A&mdash;combines with itself&mdash;just as aldehyde,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, or the cyanogen compounds are able to combine with hydrogen, oxygen, &amp;c.,
and are liable to polymerisation. On this view the molecule of tungstic acid is probably
much more complex than we represent it; this agrees with the easy volatility of such
compounds as the chloranhydrides, CrO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, MoO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, the analogues of the volatile
sulphuryl chloride, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, and with the non-volatility, or difficult volatility, of chromic
and molybdic anhydrides, the analogues of the volatile sulphuric anhydride. Such a
view also finds a certain confirmation in the researches made by Graham on the <i>colloidal</i>
state of tungstic acid, because colloidal properties only appertain to compounds of a very
complex composition. The observations made by Graham on the colloidal state of
tungstic and molybdic acids introduced much new matter into the history of these substances.
When sodium tungstate, mixed in a dilute solution with an equivalent quantity
of dilute hydrochloric acid, is placed in a dialyser, hydrochloric acid and sodium chloride
pass through the membrane, and a solution of tungstic acid remains in the dialyser.
Out of 100 parts of tungstic acid about 80 parts remain in the dialyser. The solution
has a bitter, astringent taste, and does not yield gelatinous tungstic acid (hydrogel)
either when heated or on the addition of acids or salts. It may also be evaporated to
dryness; it then forms a vitreous mass of the <i>hydrosol</i> of <i>tungstic acid</i>, which adheres
strongly to the walls of the vessel in which it has been evaporated, and is perfectly
soluble in water. It does not even lose its solubility after having been heated to 200°,
and only becomes insoluble when heated to a red heat, when it loses about 2&frac12; p.c. of
water. The dry acid, dissolved in a small quantity of water, forms a gluey mass, just
like gum arabic, which is one of the representatives of the hydrosols of colloidal
substances. The solution, containing 5 p.c of the anhydride, has a sp. gr. of 1·047; with
20 p.c., of 1·217; with 50 p.c., of 1·80; and with 80 p.c., of 3·24. The presence of a
polymerised trioxide in the form of hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>OW<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>WO<sub>3</sub>, must then be
recognised in the solution: this is confirmed by Sabaneeff's cryoscopic determinations
(1889). A similar stable solution of molybdic acid is obtained by the dialysis of a
mixture of a strong solution of sodium molybdate with hydrochloric acid (the precipitate
which is formed is re-dissolved). If MoCl<sub>4</sub> be precipitated by ammonia and washed with
water, a point is reached at which perfect solution takes place, and the molybdic acid
forms a colloid solution which is precipitated by the addition of ammonia (Muthmann).
The addition of alkali to the solutions of the hydrosols of tungstic and molybdic acids
immediately results in the re-formation of the ordinary tungstates and molybdates.
There appears to be no doubt but that the same transformation is accomplished in the
passage of the ordinary tungstates into the metatungstates as takes place in the passage
of tungstic acid itself from an insoluble into a soluble state; but this may be even
actually proved to be the case, because Scheibler obtained a solution of tungstic acid,
before Graham, by decomposing barium metatungstate (BaO<sub>4</sub>WO<sub>3</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O) with sulphuric
acid. By treating this salt with sulphuric acid in the amount required for the precipitation
of the baryta, Scheibler obtained a solution of metatungstic acid which, when
containing 43·75 p.c. of acid, had a sp. gr. of 1·634, and with 27·61 p.c. a sp. gr. of 1·327&mdash;that
is, specific gravities corresponding with those found by Graham.</p>

<p>Péchard found that as much heat is evolved by neutralising metatungstic acid as with
sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Questions connected with the metamorphoses or modifications of tungstic and
molybdic acids, and the polymerisation and colloidal state of substances, as well as the
formation of complex acids, belong to that class of problems the solution of which
will do much towards attaining a true comprehension of the mechanism of a number of
chemical reactions. I think, moreover, that questions of this kind stand in intimate connection
with the theory of the formation of solutions and alloys and other so-called indefinite
compounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_379" id="Footnote_9_379"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_379"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Moissan (1893) studied the compounds of Mo and W formed with carbon in the
electrical furnace (they are extremely hard) from a mixture of the anhydrides and carbon.
Poleck and Grützner obtained definite compounds FeW<sub>2</sub> and FeW<sub>2</sub>C<sub>3</sub> for tungsten.
Metallic W and Mo displace Ag from its solutions but not Pb. There is reason for believing
that the sp. gr. of pure molybdenum is higher than that (8·5) generally ascribed to it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_BIS_380" id="Footnote_9_BIS_380"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_BIS_380"><span class="label">[9 bis]</span></a> We may conclude our description of tungsten and molybdenum by stating that
their sulphur compounds have an acid character, like carbon bisulphide or stannic sulphide.
If sulphuretted hydrogen be passed through a solution of a molybdate it does
not give a precipitate unless sulphuric acid be present, when a dark brown precipitate of
<i>molybdenum trisulphide</i>, MoS<sub>3</sub>, is formed. When this sulphide is ignited without access
of air it gives the bisulphide MoS<sub>2</sub>; the latter is not able to combine with potassium sulphide
like the trisulphide MoS<sub>3</sub>, which forms a salt, K<sub>2</sub>MoS<sub>4</sub>, corresponding with K<sub>2</sub>MoO<sub>4</sub>.
This is soluble in water, and separates out from its solution in red crystals, which have a
metallic lustre and reflect a green light. It is easily obtained by heating the native
bisulphide, MoS<sub>2</sub>, with potash, sulphur, and a small amount of charcoal, which serves for
deoxidising the oxygen compounds. Tungsten gives similar compounds, R<sub>2</sub>WS<sub>4</sub>, where
R = NH<sub>4</sub>, K, Na. They are decomposed by acids, with the separation of tungsten trisulphide,
WS<sub>3</sub>, and molybdenum trisulphide, MoS<sub>3</sub>. Rideal (1892) obtained W<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3</sub> by heating

in alcohol. Their composition is represented by the formula K<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O. An ammonium
salt is obtained by evaporating peroxide of hydrogen with ammonium molybdate.
The following salts have also been obtained by the action of peroxide of hydrogen upon the
corresponding molybdates: Na<sub>2</sub>Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;in yellow prismatic crystals; MgMo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>10H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;stellar
needles; BaMoO<sub>8</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;in microscopic yellow octahedra. A corresponding
sodium pertungstate has been obtained by Péchard by boiling sodium tungstate with a
solution of peroxide of hydrogen for several minutes. The solution rapidly turns yellow,
and no longer gives a precipitate of tungstic anhydride when treated with nitric acid.
When evaporated in vacuo the solution leaves a thick syrupy liquid from which ray-like
crystals separate out; these crystals are more soluble in water than the salt originally
taken. When heated they also lose water and oxygen. Their composition answers to
the formula M<sub>2</sub>W<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O, where M = Na, NH<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c. The permolybdates and pertungstates
have similar properties. When treated with oxygen acids they give peroxide
of hydrogen, and disengage chlorine and iodine from hydrochloric acid and potassium
iodide.</p>

<p>Piccini (1891) showed that peroxide of hydrogen not only combines with the oxygen
compounds of Mo and W, but also with their fluo-compounds, among which ammonium
fluo-molybdate MoO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>2NH<sub>4</sub> and others have long been known. (A few new salts of
similar composition have been obtained by F. Moureu in 1893.) The action of peroxide
of hydrogen upon these compounds gives salts containing a larger amount of oxygen; for
instance, a solution of MoO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>2KFH<sub>2</sub>O with peroxide of hydrogen gives a yellow solution
which after cooling separates out yellow crystalline flakes of MoO<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>2KFH<sub>2</sub>O, resembling
the salt originally taken in their external appearance. By employing a similar method
Piccini also obtained: MoO<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>2RbFH<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;yellow monoclinic crystals; MoO<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>,2CsFH<sub>2</sub>O,&mdash;yellow
flakes, and the corresponding tungstic compounds. All these salts react like
peroxide of hydrogen.</p>

<p>In speaking of these compounds I for my part think it may be well to call attention
to the fact that, in the first place, the composition of Piccini's oxy-fluo compounds does
not correspond to that of permolybdic and pertungstic acid. If the latter be expressed
by formulæ with one equivalent of an element, they will be HMoO<sub>4</sub> and HWO<sub>4</sub>, and the
oxy-fluo form corresponding to them should have the composition MoO<sub>3</sub>F and WO<sub>3</sub>F
while it contains MO<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub> and WO<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, <i>i.e.</i> answers as it were to a higher degree of oxidation,
MoH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and W<sub>3</sub>HO<sub>3</sub>. But if permolybdic acid be regarded as 2MoO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <i>i.e.</i>
as containing the elements of peroxide of hydrogen, then Piccini's compound will also be
found to contain the original salts + H<sub>2</sub>O; for example, from MoO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>2KFH<sub>2</sub>O there is
obtained a compound MoO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>2KFH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, <i>i.e.</i> instead of H<sub>2</sub>O they contain H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In the
second place the capacity of the salts of molybdenum and tungsten to retain a further
amount of oxygen or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> probably bears some relation to their property of giving complex
acids and of polymerising which has been considered in Note <a href="#Footnote_8_BIS_378">8 bis</a>. There is,
however, a great chemical interest in the accumulation of data respecting these high
peroxide compounds corresponding to molybdic and tungstic acids. With regard to the
peroxide form of uranium, <i>see</i> Chapter XX., Note <a href="#Footnote_66_344">66</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_382" id="Footnote_10_382"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_382"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Uranium trioxide, or uranic oxide, shows its feeble basic and acid properties in a
great number of its reactions. (1) Solutions of uranic salts give yellow precipitates with
alkalis, but these precipitates do not contain the hydrate of the oxide, but compounds of
it with bases; for example, 2UO<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 6KHO = 4KNO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O + K<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. There are
other <i>urano-alkali compounds</i> of the same constitution; for example, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>
(known commercially as uranic oxide), MgU<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, BaU<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. They are the analogues of the
dichromates. Sodium uranate is the most generally used under the name of uranium
yellow, Na<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. It is used for imparting the characteristic yellow-green tint to glass
and porcelain. Neither heat nor water nor acids are able to extract the alkali from
sodium uranate, Na<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and therefore it is a true insoluble salt, of a yellow colour, and
clearly indicates the acid character (although feeble) of uranic oxide. (2) The carbonates
of the alkaline earths (for instance, barium carbonate) precipitate uranic oxide from its
salts, as they do all the salts of feeble bases; for example, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. (3) The <i>alkaline carbonates</i>,
when added to solutions of uranic salts, give a <i>precipitate, which is soluble in</i>
<i>an excess of the reagent</i>, and particularly so if the acid carbonates be taken. This is
due to the fact that (4) the uranyl salts <i>easily form double salts</i> with the salts of the
alkali metals, including the salts of ammonium. Uranium, in the form of these double
salts, often gives salts of well-defined crystalline form, although the simple salts are little
prone to appear in crystals. Such, for example, are the salts obtained by dissolving potassium
uranate, K<sub>2</sub>U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, in acids, with the addition of potassium salts of the same acids.
Thus, with hydrochloric acid and potassium chloride a well-formed crystalline salt,
K<sub>2</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)Cl<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, belonging to the monoclinic system, is produced. This salt decomposes
in dissolving in pure water. Among these double salts we may mention the
double carbonate with the alkalis, R<sub>4</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (equal to 2R<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + UO<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>); the
acetates, R(UO<sub>2</sub>)(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>&mdash;for instance, the sodium salt, Na(UO<sub>2</sub>)(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and the
potassium salt, K(UO<sub>2</sub>)(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O; the sulphates, R<sub>2</sub>(UO<sub>2</sub>)(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c. In the
preceding formula R = K, Na, NH<sub>4</sub>, or R<sub>2</sub> = Mg, Ba, &amp;c. <i>This property of giving
comparatively stable double salts indicates feebly developed basic properties</i>, because
double salts are mainly formed by salts of distinctly basic metals (these form, as it were,
the basic element of a double salt) and salts of feebly energetic bases (these form the acid
element of a double salt), just as the former also give acid salts; the acid of the acid
salts is replaced in the double salts by the salt of the feebly energetic base, which, like
water, belongs to the class of intermediate bases. For this reason barium does not
give double salts with alkalis as magnesium does, and this is why double salts are
more easily formed by potassium than by lithium in the series of the alkali metals.
(5) The most remarkable property, proving the feeble energy of uranic oxide as a base, is
seen in the fact that when their composition is compared with that of other salts those of
uranic oxide <i>always appear as basic salts</i>. It is well known that a normal salt, R<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>,
corresponds with the oxide R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, where X = Cl, NO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., or X<sub>2</sub> = SO<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.; but there
also exist basic salts of the same type where X = HO or X<sub>2</sub> = O. We saw salts of all
kinds among the salts of aluminium, chromium, and others. With uranic oxide no salts
are known of the types UX<sub>6</sub> (UCl<sub>6</sub>, U(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, alums, &amp;c., are not known), nor even salts,
U(HO)<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub> or UOX<sub>4</sub>, but it always forms salts of the type U(HO)<sub>4</sub>X<sub>2</sub>, or UO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>.
Judging from the fact that nearly all the salts of uranic oxide retain water in crystallising
from their solutions, and that this water is difficult to separate from them, it may be
thought to be water of hydration. This is seen in part from the fact that the composition
of many of the salts of uranic oxide may then be expressed without the presence of water
of crystallisation; for instance, U(HO)<sub>4</sub>K<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> (and the salt of NH<sub>4</sub>, U(HO)<sub>4</sub>K<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
U(HO)<sub>4</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. Sodium uranyl acetate however does not contain water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_383" id="Footnote_11_383"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_383"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> <i>Uranyl nitrate</i>, or uranium nitrate, UO<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, crystallises from its solutions
in transparent yellowish-green prisms (from an acid solution), or in tabular crystals
(from a neutral solution), which effloresce in the air and are easily soluble in water,
alcohol, and ether, have a sp. gr. of 2·8, and fuse when heated, losing nitric acid and water
in the process. If the salt itself (Berzelius) or its alcoholic solution (Malaguti) be
heated up to the temperature at which oxides of nitrogen are evolved, there then remains
a mass which, after being evaporated with water, leaves uranyl hydroxide, UO<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub>
(sp. gr. 5·93), whilst if the salt be ignited there remains the dioxide, UO<sub>2</sub>, as a brick-red
powder, which on further heating loses oxygen and forms the dark olive uranoso-uranic
oxide, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. The solution of the nitrate obtained from the ore is purified in the following
manner: sulphurous anhydride is first passed through it in order to reduce the arsenic
acid present into arsenious acid; the solution is then heated to 60°, and sulphuretted
hydrogen passed through it; this precipitates the lead, arsenic, and tin, and certain
other metals, as sulphides, insoluble in water and dilute nitric acid. This liquid is then
filtered and evaporated with nitric acid to crystallisation, and the crystals are dissolved
in ether. Or else the solution is first treated with chlorine in order to convert the ferrous
chloride (produced by the action of the hydrogen sulphide) into ferric chloride, the
oxides are then precipitated by ammonia, and the resultant precipitate, containing the
oxides Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, UO<sub>3</sub>, and compounds of the latter with potash, lime, ammonia, and other
bases present in the solution (the latter being due to the property of uranic oxide of
combining with bases), is washed and dissolved in a strong, slightly-heated solution of
ammonium carbonate, which dissolves the uranic oxide but not the ferric oxide. The
solution is filtered, and on cooling deposits a well-crystallising <i>uranyl ammonium carbonate</i>,
UO<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, in brilliant monoclinic crystals which on exposure to air slowly
give off water, carbonic anhydride, and ammonia; the same decomposition is readily
effected at 300°, the residue then consisting of uranic oxide. This salt is not very soluble
in water, but is readily so in ammonium carbonate; it is obvious that it may readily be
converted into all the other salts of oxides of uranium. Uranium salts are also purified
in the form of <i>acetate</i>, which is very sparingly soluble, and is therefore directly precipitated
from a strong solution of the nitrate by mixing it with acetic acid.</p>

<p>We may also mention the <i>uranyl phosphate</i>, HUPO<sub>6</sub>, which must be regarded as an
orthophosphate in which two hydrogens are replaced by the radicle uranyl, UO<sub>2</sub>, <i>i.e.</i> as
H(UO<sub>2</sub>)PO<sub>4</sub>. This salt is formed as a hydrated gelatinous yellow precipitate, on mixing
a solution of uranyl nitrate with disodium phosphate. The precipitation occurs in the
presence of acetic acid, but not in the presence of hydrochloric acid. If moreover an
excess of an ammonium salt be present, the ammonia enters into the composition of
the bright yellow gelatinous precipitate formed, in the proportion UO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>. This
precipitate is not soluble in water and acetic acid, and its solution in inorganic acids
when boiled entirely expels all the phosphoric acid. This fact is taken advantage of for
removing phosphoric acids from solutions&mdash;for instance, from those containing salts of
calcium and magnesium.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_384" id="Footnote_12_384"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_384"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Uranium dioxide, or <i>uranyl</i>, UO<sub>2</sub>, which is contained in the salts UO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>, has
the appearance and many of the properties of a metal. Uranic oxide may be regarded as
uranyl oxide, (UO<sub>2</sub>)O, its salts as salts of this uranyl; its hydroxide, (UO<sub>2</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is constituted
like CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The green oxide of uranium, uranoso-uranic oxide (easily formed from
uranic salts by the loss of oxygen), U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> = UO<sub>2</sub>,2UO<sub>3</sub>, when ignited with charcoal or
hydrogen (dry) gives a brilliant crystalline substance of sp. gr. about 11·0 (Urlaub), whose
appearance resembles that of metals, and decomposes steam at a red heat with the
evolution of hydrogen; it does not, however, decompose hydrochloric or sulphuric
acid, but is oxidised by nitric acid. The same substance (i.e. uranium dioxide UO<sub>2</sub>) is
also obtained by igniting the compound (UO<sub>2</sub>)K<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> in a stream of hydrogen, according
to the equation UO<sub>2</sub>K<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> = UO<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl + 2KCl. It was at first regarded as the
metal. In 1841 Peligot found that it contained oxygen, because carbonic oxide and
anhydride were evolved when it was ignited with charcoal in a stream of chlorine, and
from 272 parts of the substance which was considered to be metal he obtained 382 parts
of a volatile product containing 142 parts of chlorine. From this it was concluded that
the substance taken contained an equivalent amount of oxygen. As 142 parts of chlorine
correspond with 32 parts of oxygen, it followed that 272 - 32 = 240 parts of metal were
combined in the substance with 32 parts of oxygen, and also in the chlorine compound
obtained with 142 parts of chlorine. These calculations have been made for the now
accepted atomic weight of uranium (U = 240, <i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_14_386">14</a>). Peligot took another atomic
weight, but this does not alter the principle of the argument.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_385" id="Footnote_13_385"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_385"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> <i>Uranium tetrachloride</i>, uranous chloride, UCl<sub>4</sub>, corresponds with uranous oxide
as a base. It was obtained by Peligot by igniting uranic oxide mixed with charcoal in a
stream of <i>dry</i> chlorine: UO<sub>3</sub> + 3C + 2Cl<sub>2</sub> = UCl<sub>4</sub> + 3CO. This green volatile compound
(Note <a href="#Footnote_12_384">12</a>) crystallises in regular octahedra, is very hygroscopic, easily soluble in water,
with the development of a considerable amount of heat, and no longer separates out
from its solution in an anhydrous state, but disengages hydrochloric acid when evaporated.
The solution of uranous chloride in water is green. It is also formed by the
action of zinc and copper (forming cuprous chloride) on a solution of uranyl chloride,
UO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, especially in the presence of hydrochloric acid and sal-ammoniac. Solutions of
uranyl salts are converted into uranous salts by the action of various reducing agents,
and among others by organic substances or by the action of light, whilst the salts UX<sub>4</sub>
are converted into uranyl salts, UO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>, by exposure to air or by oxidising agents. Solutions
of the green uranyl salts act as powerful reducing agents, and give a brown precipitate
of the uranous hydroxide, UH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, with potash and other alkalis. This hydroxide
is easily soluble in acids but not in alkalis. On ignition it does not form the oxide UO<sub>2</sub>,
because it decomposes water, but when the higher oxides of uranium are ignited in a
stream of hydrogen or with charcoal they yield uranous oxide. Both it and the chloride
UCl<sub>4</sub>, dissolve in strong sulphuric acid, forming a green salt, U(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. The same
salt, together with uranyl sulphate, UO<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>), is formed when the green oxide, U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, is
dissolved in hot sulphuric acid. The salts obtained in the latter instance may be
separated by adding alcohol to the solution, which is left exposed to the light; the alcohol
reduces the uranyl salt to uranous salt, an excess of acid being required. An excess of
water decomposes this salt, forming a basic salt, which is also easily produced under
other circumstances, and contains UO(SO<sub>4</sub>),2H<sub>2</sub>O (which corresponds to the uranic salt).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_386" id="Footnote_14_386"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_386"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The atomic weight of uranium was formerly taken as half the present one, U = 120,
and the oxides U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, suboxide UO, and green oxide U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, were of the same types as the
oxides of iron. With a certain resemblance to the elements of the iron group, uranium
presents many points of distinction which do not permit its being grouped with them.
Thus uranium forms a very stable oxide, U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(U = 120), but does not give the corresponding
chloride U<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> (Roscoe, however, in 1874 obtained UCl<sub>5</sub>, like MoCl<sub>5</sub> and WCl<sub>5</sub>),
and under those circumstances (the ignition of oxide of uranium mixed with charcoal, in
a stream of chlorine), when the formation of this compound might be expected, it gives
(U = 120) the chloride UCl<sub>2</sub>, which is characterised by its volatility; this is not a property,
to such an extent, of any of the bichlorides, RCl<sub>2</sub>, of the iron group.</p>

<p>The alteration or doubling of the atomic weight of uranium&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the recognition of
U = 240&mdash;was made for the first time in the first (Russian) edition of this work (1871), and
in my memoir of the same year in Liebig's <i>Annalen</i>, on the ground that with an atomic
weight 120, uranium could not be placed in the periodic system. I think it will not be superfluous
to add the following remarks on this subject: (1) In the other groups (K&mdash;Rb&mdash;Cs,
Ca&mdash;Sr&mdash;Ba, Cl&mdash;Br&mdash;I) the acid character of the oxides decreases and their basic character
increases with the rise of atomic weight, and therefore we should expect to find the
same in the group Cr&mdash;Mo&mdash;W&mdash;U, and if CrO<sub>3</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>, WO<sub>3</sub> be the anhydrides of acids
then we indeed find a decrease in their acid character, and therefore uranium trioxide,
UO<sub>3</sub>, should be a very feeble anhydride, but its basic properties should also be very
feeble. Uranic oxide does indeed show these properties, as was pointed out above (Note
<a href="#Footnote_10_382">10</a>). (2) Chromium and its analogues, besides the oxides RO<sub>3</sub>, also form lower grades of
oxidation RO<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and the same is seen in uranium; it forms UO<sub>3</sub>, UO<sub>2</sub>, U<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and
their compounds. (3) Molybdenum and tungsten, in being reduced from RO<sub>3</sub>, easily and
frequently give an intermediate oxide of a blue colour, and uranium shows the same
property; giving the so-called green oxide which, according to present views, must
be regarded as U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> = UO<sub>2</sub>2UO<sub>3</sub>, analogous to Mo<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>. (4) The higher chlorides, RCl<sub>6</sub>,
possible for the elements of this group, are either unstable (WCl<sub>6</sub>) or do not exist at all
(Cr); but there is one single lower volatile compound, which is decomposed by water,
and liable to further reduction into a non-volatile chlorine product and the metal. The
same is observed in uranium, which forms an easily volatile chloride, UCl<sub>4</sub>, decomposed
by water. (5) The high sp. gr. of uranium (18·6) is explained by its analogy to tungsten
(sp. gr. 19·1). (6) For uranium, as for chromium and tungsten, yellow tints predominate
in the form RO<sub>3</sub>, whilst the lower forms are green and blue. (7) Zimmermann
(1881) determined the vapour densities of uranous bromide, UBr<sub>4</sub>, and chloride, UCl<sub>4</sub>
(19·4 and 13·2), and they were found to correspond to the formulæ given above&mdash;that is,
they confirmed the higher atomic weight U = 240. Roscoe, a great authority on the
metals of this group, was the first to accept the proposed atomic weight of uranium,
U = 240, which since Zimmermann's work has been generally recognised.</p></div>

green yellow fluorescence, and is sometimes employed for ornaments; it absorbs the
violet rays, like the other salts of uranic oxide&mdash;that is, it possesses an absorption spectrum
in which the violet rays are absent. The index of refraction of the absorbed rays
is altered, and they are given out again as greenish-yellow rays; hence, compounds of
uranic acid, when placed in the violet portion of the spectrum, emit a greenish-yellow
light, and this forms one of the best examples (another is found in a solution of quinine
sulphate) of the phenomenon of fluorescence. The rays of light which pass through
uranic compounds do not contain the rays which excite the phenomena of fluorescence

sulphate generally contains various impurities, and also a large amount of iron salt
(from the native MnO<sub>2</sub>), from which it cannot be freed by crystallisation. Their
removal may, however, be effected by mixing a portion of the liquid with a solution of
sodium carbonate; a precipitate of manganous carbonate is then formed. This precipitate
is collected and washed, and then added to the remaining mass of the impure
solution of manganous sulphate; on heating the solution with this precipitate, the
whole of the iron is precipitated as oxide. This is due to the fact that in the solution of
the manganese dioxide in sulphuric acid the whole of the iron is converted into the
ferric state (because the dioxide acts as an oxidising agent), which, as an exceedingly
feeble base precipitated by calcium carbonate and other kindred salts, is also precipitated
by manganous carbonate. After being treated in this manner, the solution of manganous
sulphate is further purified by crystallisation. If it be a bright red colour, it is due to
the presence of higher grades of oxidation of manganese; they may be destroyed by
boiling the solution, when the oxygen from the oxides of manganese is evolved and a
very faintly coloured solution of manganous sulphate is obtained. This salt is remarkable
for the facility with which it gives various combinations with water. By evaporating
the almost colourless solution of <i>manganous sulphate</i> at very low temperatures, and by
cooling the saturated solution at about 0°, crystals are obtained containing 7 atoms of
water of crystallisation, MnSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, which are isomorphous with cobaltous and ferrous
sulphates. These crystals, even at 10°, lose 5 p.c. of water, and completely effloresce at
15°, losing about 20 p.c. of water. By evaporating a solution of the salt at the ordinary
temperature, but not above 20°, crystals are obtained containing 5 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O, which
are isomorphous with copper sulphate; whilst if the crystallisation be carried on between
20° and 30°, large transparent prismatic crystals are formed containing 4 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O (see
Nickel). A boiling solution also deposits these crystals together with crystals containing
3 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O, whilst the first salt, when fused and boiled with alcohol, gives crystals
containing 2 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O. Graham obtained a monohydrated salt by drying the salt at
about 200°. The last atom of water is eliminated with difficulty, as is the case with all
salts like MnSO<sub>4</sub>nH<sub>2</sub>O. The crystals containing a considerable amount of water are
rose-coloured, and the anhydrous crystals are colourless. The solubility of MnSO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O
(Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_24_71">24</a>) per 100 parts of water is: at 10°, 127 parts; at 37°·5, 149 parts; at
75°, 145 parts; and at 101°, 92 parts. Whence it is seen that at the boiling-point this salt
is less soluble than at lower temperatures, and therefore a solution saturated at the
ordinary temperature becomes turbid when boiled. Manganous sulphate, being analogous
to magnesium sulphate, is decomposed, like the latter, when ignited, but it does not then
leave manganous oxide, but the intermediate oxide, Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. It gives double salts with
the alkali sulphates. With aluminium sulphate it forms fine radiated crystals, whose
composition resembles that of the alums&mdash;namely, MnAl<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>4</sub>,24H<sub>2</sub>O. This salt is
easily soluble in water, and occurs in nature.</p>

<p><i>Manganous chloride</i>, MCl<sub>2</sub>, crystallises with 4 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O, like the ferrous salt, and
not with 6 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O like many kindred salts&mdash;for example, those of cobalt, calcium, and
magnesium; 100 parts of water dissolve 38 parts of the anhydrous salt at 10° and 55
parts at 62°. Alcohol also dissolves manganous chloride, and the alcoholic solution
burns with a red flame. This salt, like magnesium chloride, readily forms double salts.
A solution of borax gives a dirty rose-coloured precipitate having the composition
MnH<sub>4</sub>(BO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, which is used as a drier in paint-making. Potassium cyanide produces
a yellowish-grey precipitate, MnC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, with manganous salts, soluble in an excess of
the reagent, a double salt, K<sub>4</sub>MnC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, corresponding with potassium ferrocyanide,
being formed. On evaporation of this solution, a portion of the manganese is oxidised
and precipitated, whilst a salt corresponding to Gmelin's red salt, K<sub>3</sub>,MnC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> (<i>see</i>
Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII</a>.), remains in solution. Sulphuretted hydrogen does not precipitate
salts of manganese, not even the acetate, but ammonium sulphide gives a flesh-coloured
precipitate, MnS; at 320° this sulphide of manganese passes into a green variety (Antony).
Oxalic acid in strong solutions of manganous salts gives a white precipitate of the
oxalate, MnC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This precipitate is insoluble in water, and is used for the preparation
of manganous oxide itself because it decomposes like oxalic acid when ignited (in a tube
without access of air), with the formation of carbonic anhydride, carbonic oxide, and
manganous oxide. <i>Manganous oxide</i> thus obtained is a green powder, which however
oxidises with such facility that it burns in air when brought into contact with an
incandescent substance, and passes into the red intermediate oxide Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. In solutions
of manganous salts, alkalis produce a precipitate of the hydroxide MnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which
rapidly absorbs oxygen in the presence of air and gives the brown intermediate oxide,
or, more correctly speaking, its hydrate.</p>

<p>Manganous oxide, besides being obtained by the above-described method from manganous
oxalate, may also be obtained by igniting the higher oxides in a stream of
hydrogen, and also from manganese carbonate. The manganous oxide ignited in the
presence of hydrogen acquires a great density, and is no longer so easily oxidised. It
may also be obtained in a crystalline form, if during the ignition of the carbonate or
higher oxide a trace of dry hydrochloric acid gas be passed into the current of hydrogen.
It is thus obtained in the form of transparent emerald green crystals of the regular
system, and in this state is easily soluble in acids.</p>

<p>Manganous oxide in oxidising gives the <i>red oxide of manganese</i>, Mn<sub>5</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This is the
most stable of all the oxides of manganese; it is not only stable at the ordinary but also at
a high temperature&mdash;that is, it does not absorb or disengage oxygen spontaneously.
When ignited, all the higher oxides of manganese pass into it by losing oxygen, and
manganous oxide by absorbing oxygen. This oxide does not give any distinct salts,
but it dissolves in sulphuric acid, forming a dark red solution, which contains both
manganous and manganic (of the <i>oxide</i>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) sulphates. The latter with potassium
sulphate gives a manganese alum, in which the alumina is replaced by its isomorphous
oxide of manganese. But this alum, like the solution of the intermediate oxide in sulphuric
acid, evolves oxygen and leaves a manganous salt when slightly heated.</p>

<p><i>Manganese dioxide</i> is still less basic than the oxide, and disengages oxygen or a
halogen in the presence of acids, forming manganous salts, like the oxide. However, if it
be suspended in ether, and hydrochloric acid gas passed into the mixture, which is kept
cool, the ether acquires a green colour, owing to the formation of tetrachloride of
manganese, MnCl<sub>4</sub>, corresponding with the dioxide which passes into solution. It is
however very unstable, being exceedingly easily decomposed with the evolution of
chlorine. The corresponding fluoride, MnF<sub>4</sub>, obtained by Nicklés is much more stable.
At all events, manganese dioxide does not exhibit any well-defined basic character, but
has rather an acid character, which is particularly shown in the compounds MnF<sub>4</sub> and
MnCl<sub>4</sub> just mentioned, and in the property of manganese dioxide of combining with
alkalis. If the higher grades of oxidation of manganese be deoxidised in the presence of
alkalis, they frequently give the dioxide combined with the alkali&mdash;for example, in the
presence of potash a compound is formed which contains K<sub>2</sub>O,5MnO<sub>2</sub>, which shows the
weak acid character of this oxide. When ignited in the presence of sodium compounds
manganese dioxide frequently forms Na<sub>2</sub>O,8MnO<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>O,12MnO<sub>2</sub>, and lime when
heated with MnO<sub>2</sub> gives from CaO,3MnO<sub>2</sub> to (CaO)<sub>2</sub>,MnO<sub>2</sub> (Rousseau) according to the
temperature. Besides which, perhaps, MnO<sub>2</sub> is a saline compound, containing
MnOMnO<sub>3</sub> or (MnO)<sub>3</sub>Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and there are reactions which support such a view (Spring,
Richards, Traube, and others); for instance it is known that manganous chloride and
potassium permanganate give the dioxide in the presence of alkalis.</p>

<p>Manganese dioxide may be obtained from manganous salts by the action of oxidising
agents. If manganous hydroxide or carbonate be shaken up in water through
which chlorine is passed, the hypochlorite of the metal is not formed, as is the case
with certain other oxides, but manganese dioxide is precipitated: 2MnO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>
= MnCl<sub>2</sub> + MnO<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O. Owing to this fact, hypochlorites in the presence of alkalis
and acetic acid when added to a solution of manganous salts give hydrated manganese
dioxide, as was mentioned above. Manganous nitrate also leaves manganese dioxide
when heated to 200°. It is also obtained from manganous and manganic salts of the
alkalis, when they are decomposed in the presence of a small amount of acid; the practical
method of converting the salts MnX<sub>2</sub> into the higher grades of oxidation is given in
Chapter II., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_6_128">6</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_393" id="Footnote_20_393"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_393"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Other chemists have obtained manganese by different methods, and attributed
different properties to it. This difference probably depends on the presence of carbon
in different proportions. Deville obtained manganese by subjecting the pure dioxide,
mixed with pure charcoal (from burnt sugar), to a strong heat in a lime crucible until the
resultant metal fused. The metal obtained had a rose tint, like bismuth, and like it
was very brittle, although exceedingly hard. It decomposed water at the ordinary
temperature. Brunner obtained manganese having a specific gravity of about 7·2, which
decomposed water very feebly at the ordinary temperature, did not oxidise in air, and
was capable of taking a bright polish, like steel; it had the grey colour of cast iron, was
very brittle, and hard enough to scratch steel and glass, like a diamond. Brunner's
method was as follows: He decomposed the manganese fluoride (obtained as a soluble
compound by the action of hydrofluoric acid on manganese carbonate) with sodium, by
mixing these substances together in a crucible and covering the mixture with a layer of
salt and fluor spar; after which the crucible was first gradually heated until the reaction
began, and then strongly heated in order to fuse the metal separated. Glatzel (1889)
obtained 25 grms. of manganese, having a grey colour and sp. gr. 7·39, by heating a
mixture of 100 grms. of MnCl<sub>2</sub> with 200 grms. KCl and 15 grms. Mg to a bright white
heat. Moissan and others, by heating the oxides of manganese with carbon in the electric
furnace, obtained carbides of manganese&mdash;for example, Mn<sub>3</sub>C&mdash;and remarked that the metal
volatilised in the heat of the voltaic arc. Metallic manganese is, however, not prepared on
a large scale, but only its alloys with carbon (they readily and rapidly oxidise) and <i>ferro-manganese</i>
or a coarsely crystalline alloy of iron, manganese and carbon, which is
smelted in blast-furnaces like pig-iron (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII.</a>) This ferro-manganese is
employed in the manufacture of steel by Bessemer's and other processes (see Chapter
<a href="#Page_317">XXII.</a>) and for the manufacture of manganese bronze. However, in America, Green and
Wahl (1895) obtained almost pure metallic manganese on a large scale. They first treat
the ore of MnO<sub>2</sub> with 30 p.c. sulphuric acid (which extracts all the oxides of iron
present in the ore), and then heat it in a reducing flame to convert it into MnO, which
they mix with a powder of Al, lime and CaF<sub>2</sub> (as a flux), and heat the mixture in a
crucible lined with magnesia; a reaction immediately takes place at a certain temperature,
and a metal of specific gravity 7·3 is obtained, which only contains a small trace of iron.</p>

<p>Manganese gives two compounds with <i>nitrogen</i>, Mn<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub> and Mn<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. They were
obtained by Prelinger (1894) from the amalgam of manganese Mn<sub>2</sub>Hg<sub>5</sub> (obtained on a
mercury anode by the action of an electric current upon a solution of MnCl<sub>2</sub>); the
mercury may be removed from this amalgam by heating it in an atmosphere of hydrogen,
and then metallic manganese is obtained as a grey porous mass of specific gravity 7·42.
If this amalgam be heated in dry nitrogen it gives Mn<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub> (grey powder, sp. gr. 6·58), but
if heated in an atmosphere of NH<sub>3</sub> it gives (as also does Mn<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>) Mn<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, (a dark mass
with a metallic lustre, sp. gr. 6·21), which, when heated in nitrogen is converted into
Mn<sub>5</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and if heated in hydrogen evolves NH<sub>3</sub> and disengages hydrogen from a solution
of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. At all events, manganese is a metal which decomposes water more easily
than iron, nickel, and cobalt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_395" id="Footnote_22_395"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_395"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> It was known to the alchemists by this name, but the true explanation of the
change in colour is due to the researches of Chevillot, Edwards, Mitscherlich, and
Forchhammer. The change in colour of potassium manganate is due to its instability
and to its splitting up into two other manganese compounds, a higher and a
lower: 3MnO<sub>3</sub> = Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> + MnO<sub>2</sub>. Manganese trioxide is really decomposed in this manner
by the action of water (see later): 3MnO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2MnHO<sub>4</sub> + MnO<sub>2</sub> (Franke, Thorpe,
and Humbly). The instability of the salt is proved by the fact of its being deoxidised by
organic matter, with the formation of manganese dioxide and alkali, so that, for instance,
a solution of this salt cannot be filtered through paper. The presence of an excess of
alkali increases the stability of the salt; when heated it breaks up in the presence of
water, with the evolution of oxygen.</p>

<p>The method of preparing <i>potassium permanganate</i> will be understood from the above.
There are many recipes for preparing this substance, as it is now used in considerable
quantities both for technical and laboratory purposes. But in all cases the essence of
the methods is one and the same: a mixture of alkali with any oxide of manganese
(even manganous hydroxide, which may be obtained from manganous chloride) is first
heated in the presence of air or of an oxidising substance (for the sake of rapidity, with
potassium chlorate); the resultant mass is then treated with water and heated, when
manganese dioxide is precipitated and potassium permanganate remains in solution.
This solution may be boiled, as the liquid will contain free alkali; but the solution
cannot be evaporated to dryness, because a strong solution, as well as the solid salt, is
decomposed by heat.</p>

<p>By adding a dilute solution of manganous sulphate to a boiling mixture of lead
dioxide and dilute nitric acid, the whole of the manganese may be converted into permanganic
acid (Crum).</p></div>

acquires a green tint.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_397" id="Footnote_23_397"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_397"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> A solution of potassium permanganate gives a beautiful absorption spectrum
(Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_338">XIII.</a>) If the light in passing through this solution loses a portion of its rays
in it (if one may so account for it), this is partially explained by the increased oxidising
power which the solution then acquires. We may here also remark that a dilute solution
of permanganate of potassium forms a colourless solution with nickel salts, because
the green colour of the solution of nickel salts is complementary to the red. Such a
decolorised solution, containing a large proportion of nickel and a small proportion of
manganese, decomposes after a time, throws down a precipitate, and re-acquires the
green colour proper to the nickel salts. The addition of a solution of a cobalt salt (rose-red)
to the nickel salt also destroys the colour of both salts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_398" id="Footnote_24_398"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_398"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> If sulphuric acid is allowed to act on potassium permanganate without any special
precautions, a large amount of oxygen is evolved (it may even explode and inflame), and
a violet spray of the decomposing permanganic acid is given off. But if the pure salt
(<i>i.e.</i> free from chlorine) be dissolved in pure well-cooled sulphuric acid, without
any rise in temperature, a green-coloured liquid settles at the bottom of the vessel.
This liquid does not contain any sulphuric acid, and consists of permanganic anhydride,
Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (Aschoff, Terreil). It is impossible to prepare any considerable quantity of the
anhydride by this method, as it decomposes with an explosion as it collects, evolving
oxygen and leaving red oxide of manganese. <i>Permanganic anhydride</i>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, in
dissolving in sulphuric acid, gives a green solution, which (according to Franke, 1887) contains
a compound Mn<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>10</sub> = (MnO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;that is, sulphuric acid in which both hydrogens
are replaced by the group MnO<sub>3</sub>, which is combined with OK in permanganate of
potassium. This mixture with a small quantity of water gives Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, according to the
equation: (MnO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and when heated to 30° it gives <i>manganese
trioxide</i>, (MnO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2MnO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + O. Pure manganese trioxide is
obtained if the solution of (MnO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> be poured in drops on to sodium carbonate. Then,
together with carbonic anhydride, a spray of manganese trioxide passes over, which
may be collected in a well-cooled receiver, and this shows that the reaction proceeds
according to the equation: (MnO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2MnO<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + O (Thorpe).
The trioxide is decomposed by water, forming manganese dioxide and a solution of
<i>permanganic acid</i>: 3MnO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = MnO<sub>2</sub> + 2HMnO<sub>4</sub>. The same acid is obtained by
dissolving permanganic anhydride in water.</p>

<p>Barium permanganate when treated with sulphuric acid gives the same acid. This
barium salt may be prepared by the action of barium chloride on the difficultly soluble
silver permanganate, AgMnO<sub>4</sub>, which is precipitated on mixing a strong solution of the
potassium salt with silver nitrate. The solution of permanganic acid forms a bright red
liquid which reflects a dark violet tint. A dilute solution has exactly the same colour
as that of the potassium salt. It deposits manganese dioxide when exposed to the action
of light, and also when heated above 60°, and this proceeds the more rapidly the more
dilute the solution. It shows its oxidising properties in many cases, as already
mentioned. Even hydrogen gas is absorbed by a solution of permanganic acid; and
charcoal and sulphur are also oxidised by it, as they are by potassium permanganate.
This may be taken advantage of in analysing gunpowder, because when it is treated
with a solution of potassium permanganate, all the sulphur is converted into sulphuric
acid and all the charcoal into carbonic anhydride. Finely-divided platinum immediately
decomposes permanganic acid. With potassium iodide it liberates iodine (which may
afterwards be oxidised into iodic acid) (Mitscherlich, Fromherz, Aschoff, and others).
Ammonia does not form a corresponding salt with free permanganic acid, because it is
oxidised with evolution of nitrogen. The oxidising action of permanganic acid in a
strong solution may be accompanied by flame and the formation of violet fumes of
permanganic acid; thus a strong solution of it takes fire when brought into contact with
paper, alcohol, alkaline sulphides, fats, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We may add that, according to Franke, 1 part of potassium permanganate with 13
parts of sulphuric acid at 100° gives brown crystals of the salt Mn<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O,
which gives a precipitate of hydrated manganese dioxide, H<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub> = MnO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, when
treated with water.</p>

<p>Spring, by precipitating potassium permanganate with sodium sulphite and washing
the precipitate by decantation, obtained a soluble colloidal manganese oxide, whose
composition was the mean between Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and MnO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;namely, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,4(MnO<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O).</p></div>

methods of chemical analysis which are known as &lsquo;titrations&rsquo; (volumetric analysis), and
consist in measuring the volume of solutions of known strength required for the complete
conversion of a given substance. Details respecting the theory and practice of titration,
in which potassium permanganate is very frequently employed, must be looked for in
works on analytical chemistry.</p></div>

of forces in mechanics, but in that case the velocities are magnitudes of length or paths
passed over in a unit of time. The velocity of chemical change embodies a conception of
quite another kind. In the first place, the velocities of reactions are magnitudes of the
masses which have entered into chemical transformations; in the second place, these
velocities can only be relative quantities. Hence the conception of &lsquo;velocity&rsquo; has quite a
different meaning in chemistry from what it has in mechanics. Their only common factor
is time. If <i>dt</i> be the increment of time and <i>dx</i> the quantity of a substance changed in
this space of time, then the fraction (or quotient) <i>dx/dt</i> will express the rate of the
reaction. The natural conclusion, come to both by Harcourt and Esson, and previously to
them (1850) by Wilhelmj (who investigated the rate of conversion, or inversion, of sugar
in its passage into glucose), consists in establishing that this velocity is proportional to
the quantity of substances still unchanged&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> that <i>dx/dt</i> = C(A - <i>x</i>), where C is a
constant coefficient of proportionality, and where A is the quantity of a substance taken
for reaction at the moment when <i>t</i> = 0 and <i>x</i> = 0&mdash;that is, at the beginning of the
experiment, from which the time <i>t</i> and quantity <i>x</i> of substance changed is counted.
On integrating the preceding equation we obtain log(A/(A - <i>x</i>)) = <i>kt</i>, where <i>k</i> is a new
constant, if we take ordinary (and not natural) logarithms. Hence, knowing A, <i>x</i>, and <i>t</i>,
for each reaction, we find <i>k</i>, and it proves to be a constant quantity. Thus from the
figures cited in the text for the reaction 2KMnO<sub>4</sub> + 108C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 14MnSO<sub>4</sub>, it may be
calculated that <i>k</i> = 0·0114; for example, <i>t</i> = 44, <i>x</i> = 68·4 (A = 100), whence <i>kt</i> = 0·5004 and
<i>k</i> = 0·0114, (<i>see also</i> Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_3_830">3</a>, and Chapter XVII., Note <a href="#Footnote_25_BIS_95">25 bis</a>).</p></div>

novelty of this subject, and the absence of applicable as well as indubitable
deductions, I consider it impossible to enter into this province of theoretical chemistry,
although I am quite confident that its development should lead to very important results,
especially in respect to chemical equilibria, for Van't Hoff has already shown that
the limit of reaction in reversible reactions is determined by the attainment of equal

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">IRON, COBALT, AND NICKEL</span></h2>

<p>Judging from the atomic weights, and the forms of the higher oxides
of the elements already considered, it is easy to form an idea of
the seven groups of the periodic system. Such are, for instance, the
typical series Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, or the third series, Na, Mg, Al, Si,
P, S, Cl. The seven usual types of oxides from R<sub>2</sub>O to R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> correspond
with them (Chapter <a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>) The position of the eighth group is quite
separate, and is determined by the fact that, as we have already seen,
in each group of metals having a greater atomic weight than potassium
a distinction ought to be made between the elements of the even and
uneven series. The series of even elements, commencing with a
strikingly alkaline element (potassium, rubidium, cæsium), together with
the uneven series following it, and concluding with a haloid (chlorine,
bromine, iodine), forms a large period, the properties of whose members
repeat themselves in other similar periods. The elements of the eighth
group are situated between the elements of the even series and the elements
of the uneven series following them. And for this reason elements
of the eighth group are found in the middle of each large period. The
properties of the elements belonging to it, in many respects independent
and striking, are shown with typical clearness in the case of iron, the
well-known representative of this group.</p>

<p><i>Iron</i> is one of those elements which are not only widely diffused in
the crust of the earth, but also throughout the entire universe. Its
oxides and their various compounds are found in the most diverse
portions of the earth's crust; but here iron is always found combined
with some other element. Iron is not found on the earth's surface in
a free state, because it easily oxidises under the action of air. It is
occasionally found in the native state in meteorites, or aerolites, which
fall upon the earth.</p>

<p><i>Meteoric iron</i> is formed outside the earth.<a name="FNanchor_1_402" id="FNanchor_1_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_402" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Meteorites are fragments
which are carried round the sun in orbits, and fall upon the earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
when coming into proximity with it during their motion in space. The
meteoric dust, on passing through the upper parts of the atmosphere,
and becoming incandescent from friction with the gases, produces that
phenomenon which is familiar under the name of falling stars.<a name="FNanchor_2_403" id="FNanchor_2_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_403" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Such is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the doctrine concerning meteorites, and therefore the fact of their
containing rocky (siliceous) matter and metallic iron shows that outside
the earth the elements and their aggregation are in some degree the
same as upon the earth itself.</p>

<p>The most widely diffused terrestrial compound of iron is iron
bisulphide, FeS<sub>2</sub>, or <i>iron pyrites</i>. It occurs in formations of both
aqueous and igneous origin, and sometimes in enormous masses. It is
a substance having a greyish-yellow colour, with a metallic lustre, and a
specific gravity of 5·0; it crystallises in the regular system.<a name="FNanchor_2_BIS_404" id="FNanchor_2_BIS_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_BIS_404" class="fnanchor">[2 bis]</a></p>

<p>The oxides are the principal ores used for producing metallic iron.
The majority of the ores contain ferric oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, either in a
free state or combined with water, or else in combination with ferrous
oxide, FeO. The species and varieties of iron ores are numerous and
diverse. Ferric oxide in a separate form appears sometimes as crystals
of the rhombohedric system, having a metallic lustre and greyish steel
colour; they are brittle, and form a red powder, specific gravity about
5·25. Ferric oxide in type of oxidation and properties resembles
alumina; it is, however, although with difficulty, soluble in acids even
when anhydrous. The crystalline oxide bears the name of <i>specular
iron ore</i>, but ferric oxide most often occurs in a non-crystalline form,
in masses having a red fracture, and is then known as <i>red hæmatite</i>.
In this form, however, it is rather a rare ore, and is principally found
in veins. The hydrates of ferric oxide, ferric hydroxides,<a name="FNanchor_3_405" id="FNanchor_3_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_405" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> are most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
often found in aqueous or stratified formations, and are known as
<i>brown hæmatites</i>; they generally have a brown colour, form a yellowish-brown
powder, and have no metallic lustre but an earthy appearance.
They easily dissolve in acids and diffuse through other formations, especially
clays (for instance, ochre); they sometimes occur in reniform and
similar masses, evidently of aqueous origin. Such are, for instance,
the so-called bog or lake and peat ores found at the bottom of marshes
and lakes, and also under and in peat beds. This ore is formed from
water containing ferrous carbonate in solution, which, after absorbing
oxygen, deposits ferric hydroxide. In rivers and springs, iron is found
in solution as ferrous carbonate through the agency of carbonic
acid: hence the existence of chalybeate springs containing FeCO<sub>3</sub>.
This ferrous carbonate, or <i>siderite</i>, is either found as a non-crystalline
product of evidently aqueous origin, or as a crystalline spar called
<i>spathic iron ore</i>. The reniform deposits of the former are most remarkable;
they are called spherosiderites, and sometimes form whole
strata in the jurassic and carboniferous formations. <i>Magnetic
iron ore</i>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> = FeO,Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, in virtue of its purity and practical
uses, is a very important ore; it is a compound of the ferrous and
ferric oxides, is naturally magnetic, has a specific gravity of 5·1,
crystallises in well-formed crystals of the regular system, is with difficulty
soluble in acids, and sometimes forms enormous masses, as, for
instance, Mount Blagodat in the Ural. However, in most cases&mdash;for
instance, at Korsak-Mogila (to the north of Berdiansk and Nogaiska,
near the Sea of Azov), or at Krivoi Rog (to the west of Ekaterinoslav)&mdash;the
magnetic iron ore is mixed with other iron ores. In the Urals, the
Caucasus (without mentioning Siberia), and in the districts adjoining the
basin of the Don, Russia possesses the richest iron ores in the world.
To the south of Moscow, in the Governments of Toula and Nijninovgorod,
in the Olonetz district, and in the Government of Orloffsky
(near Zinovieff in the district of Kromsky), and in many other places,
there are likewise abundant supplies of iron ores amongst the deposited
aqueous formations; the siderite of Orloffsky, for instance, is distinguished
by its great purity.<a name="FNanchor_4_406" id="FNanchor_4_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_406" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Iron is also found in the form of various other compounds&mdash;for
instance, in certain silicates, and also in some phosphates; but these
forms are comparatively rare in nature in a pure state, and have not
the industrial importance of those natural compounds of iron previously
mentioned. In small quantities iron enters into the composition
of every kind of <i>soil</i> and all rocky formations. As ferrous oxide,
FeO, is isomorphous with magnesia, and ferric oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with
alumina, isomorphous substitution is possible here, and hence minerals
are not unfrequently found in which the quantity of iron varies considerably;
such, for instance, are pyroxene, amphibole, certain varieties
of mica, &amp;c. Although much iron oxide is deleterious to the growth of
vegetation, still plants do not flourish without iron; it enters as an
indispensable component into the composition of all higher <i>organisms</i>;
in the ash of plants we always find more or less of its compounds. It
also occurs in blood, and forms one of the colouring matters in it;
100 parts of the blood of the highest organisms contain about 0·05 of iron.</p>

<p>The <i>reduction</i> of the ores of iron into metallic iron is in principle
very simple, because when the oxides of iron are strongly heated
with charcoal, hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and other reducing agents,<a name="FNanchor_5_407" id="FNanchor_5_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_407" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
they easily give metallic iron. But the matter is rendered more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
difficult by the fact that the iron does not melt at the heat developed
by the combustion of the charcoal, and therefore it does not separate
from those mechanically mixed impurities which are found in the iron
ore. This is obviated by the following very remarkable property of
iron: at a high temperature it is capable of combining with a small
quantity (from 2 to 5 p.c.) of carbon, and then forms <i>cast iron</i>, which
easily <i>melts</i> in the heat developed by the combustion of charcoal in air.
For this reason metallic iron is not obtained directly from the ore, but
is only formed after the further treatment of the cast iron; the first
product extracted from the ore being cast iron. The fused mass disposes
itself in the furnace below the slag&mdash;that is, the impurities of the
ore fused by the heat of the furnace. If these impurities did not fuse
they would block up the furnace in which the ore was being smelted,
and the continuous smelting of the cast iron would not be possible;<a name="FNanchor_6_408" id="FNanchor_6_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_408" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
it would be necessary periodically to cool the furnace and heat it up
again, which means a wasteful expenditure of fuel, and hence in the
production of cast iron, the object in view is to obtain all the earthy
impurities of the ore in the shape of a fused mass or slag. Only
in rare cases does the ore itself form a mass which fuses at the
temperature employed, and these cases are objectionable if much iron
oxide is carried away in the slag. The impurities of the ores most
often consist of certain mixtures&mdash;for instance, a mixture of clay and
sand, or a mixture of limestone and clay, or quartz, &amp;c. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
impurities do not separate of themselves, or do not fuse. The difficulty
of the industry lies in forming an easily-fusible slag, into which the
whole of the foreign matter of the ore would pass and flow down to the
bottom of the furnace above the heavier cast iron. This is effected by
mixing certain <i>fluxes</i> with the ore and charcoal. A flux is a substance
which, when mixed with the foreign matter of the ore, forms a fusible
vitreous mass or slag. The flux used for silica is limestone with clay;
for limestone a definite quantity of silica is used, the best procedure
having been arrived at by experiment and by long practice in iron
smelting and other metallurgical processes.<a name="FNanchor_7_409" id="FNanchor_7_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_409" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Thus the following materials have to be introduced into the furnace
where the smelting of the iron ore is carried on: (1) the iron ore,
composed of oxide of iron and foreign matter; (2) the flux required to
form a fusible slag with the foreign matter; (3) the carbon which is
necessary (<i>a</i>) for reducing, (<i>b</i>) for combining with the reduced iron
to form cast iron, (<i>c</i>) principally for the purpose of combustion and
the heat generated thereby, necessary not only for reducing the iron
and transforming it into cast iron, but also for melting the slag, as well
as the cast iron&mdash;and (4) the air necessary for the combustion of the
charcoal. The air is introduced after a preparatory heating in order to
economise fuel and to obtain the highest temperature. The air is
forced in under pressure by means of a special blast arrangement.
This permits of an exact regulation of the heat and rate of smelting.
All these component parts necessary for the smelting of iron must be
contained in a vertical, that is, <i>shaft furnace</i>, which at the base must
have a receptacle for the accumulation of the slag and cast iron formed,
in order that the operation may proceed without interruption. The
walls of such a furnace ought to be built of fireproof materials if it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
designed to serve for the continuous production of cast iron by charging
the ore, fuel, and flux into the mouth of the furnace, forcing a blast of
air into the lower part, and running out the molten iron and slag from
below. The whole operation is conducted in furnaces known as <i>blast
furnaces</i>. The annexed illustration, fig. <a href="#fig_93">93</a> (which is taken by kind
permission from Thorpe's Dictionary of Applied Chemistry), represents
the vertical section of such a furnace. These furnaces are generally
of large dimensions&mdash;varying from 50 to 90 feet in height. They are
sometimes built against rising ground in order to afford easy access to
the top where the ore, flux, and charcoal or coke are charged.<a name="FNanchor_8_410" id="FNanchor_8_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_410" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a><br /><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>cast iron</i> formed in blast furnaces is not always of the same
quality. When slowly cooled it is soft, has a grey colour, and is not
completely soluble in acids. When treated with acids a residue of
graphite remains; it is known as <i>grey</i> or soft cast iron. This is the
general form of the ordinary cast iron used for casting various objects,
because in this state it is not so brittle as in the shape of <i>white cast
iron</i>, which does not leave particles of graphite when dissolved, but
yields its carbon in the form of hydrocarbons. This white cast iron
is characterised by its whitish-grey colour, dull lustre, the crystalline
structure of its fracture (more homogeneous than that of grey iron), and
such hardness that a file will hardly cut it. When white cast iron is
produced (from manganese ore) at high temperatures (and with an excess
of lime), and containing little sulphur and silica but a considerable
amount of carbon (as much as 5 p.c.), it acquires a coarse crystalline
structure which increases in proportion to the amount of manganese,
and it is then known under the name of &lsquo;spiegeleisen&rsquo; (and &lsquo;ferro-manganese&rsquo;).<a name="FNanchor_9_411" id="FNanchor_9_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_411" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>Cast iron is a material which is either suitable for direct application
for casting in moulds or else for working up into <i>wrought iron</i> and
<i>steel</i>. The latter principally differ from cast iron in their containing
less carbon&mdash;thus, steel contains from 1 p.c. to 0·5 p.c. of carbon and
far less silicon and manganese than cast iron; wrought iron does
not generally contain more than 0·25 p.c. of carbon and not more than
0·25 p.c. of the other impurities. Thus the essence of the working up
of cast iron into steel and wrought iron consists in the removal of the
greater part of the carbon and other elements, S, P, Mn, Si, &amp;c. This
is effected by means of oxidation, because the oxygen of the atmosphere,
oxidising the iron at a high temperature, forms solid oxides with it;
and the latter, coming into contact with the carbon contained in the
cast iron, are deoxidised, forming wrought iron and carbonic oxide,
which is evolved from the mass in a gaseous form. It is evident that
the oxidation must be carried on with a molten mass in a state of
agitation, so that the oxygen of the air may be brought into contact
with the whole mass of carbon contained in the cast iron, or else the
operation is effected by means of the addition of oxygen compounds
of iron (oxides, ores, as in Martin's process). Cast iron melts much
more easily than wrought iron and steel, and, therefore, as the carbon
separates, the mass in the furnace (in puddling) or hearth (in the
bloomery process) becomes more and more solid; moreover the degree of
hardness forms, to a certain extent, a measure of the amount of carbon
separated, and the operation may terminate either in the formation of
steel or wrought iron.<a name="FNanchor_10_412" id="FNanchor_10_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_412" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> In any case, the iron used for industrial purposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
contains impurities. <i>Chemically pure iron</i> may be obtained by
precipitating iron from a solution (a mixture of ferrous sulphate with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
magnesium sulphate or ammonium chloride) by the prolonged action of
a feeble galvanic current; the iron may be then obtained as a dense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a><br /><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a><br /><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
mass. This method, proposed by Böttcher and applied by Klein, gives,
as R. Lenz showed, iron containing occluded hydrogen, which is disengaged
on heating. This galvanic deposition of iron is used for
making galvanoplastic <i>clichés</i>, which are distinguished for their great
hardness. Electro-deposited iron is brittle, but if heated (after the
separation of the hydrogen) it becomes soft. If pure ferric hydroxide,
which is easily prepared by the precipitation of solutions of ferric
salts by means of ammonia, be heated in a stream of hydrogen, it
forms, first of all, a dull black powder which ignites spontaneously in
air (pyrophoric iron), and then a grey powder of pure iron. The
powdery substance first obtained is an iron suboxide; when thrown
into the air it ignites, forming the oxide Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. If the heating in
hydrogen be continued, more water and pure iron, which does not
ignite spontaneously, will be obtained. If a small quantity of iron be
fused in the oxyhydrogen flame (with an excess of oxygen) in a piece
of lime and mixed with powdered glass, pure molten iron will be
formed, because in the oxyhydrogen flame iron melts and burns, but
the substances mixed with the iron oxidise first. The oxidised impurities
here either disappear (carbonic anhydride) in a gaseous form,
or turn into slag (silica, manganese, oxide, and others)&mdash;that is, fuse
with the glass. Pure iron has a silvery white colour and a specific
gravity of 7·84; it melts at a temperature higher than the melting-points
of silver, gold, nickel, and steel, <i>i.e.</i> about 1400°-1500° and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
below the melting point of platinum (1750°).<a name="FNanchor_11_413" id="FNanchor_11_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_413" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But pure iron becomes
soft at a temperature considerably below that at which it melts, and
may then be easily forged, welded, and rolled or drawn into sheets and
wire.<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_414" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_414" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a> Pure iron may be rolled into an exceedingly thin sheet,
weighing less than a sheet of ordinary paper of the same size. This
ductility is the most important property of iron in all its forms, and is
most marked with sheet iron, and least so with cast iron, whose
ductility, compared with wrought iron, is small, but it is still very
considerable when compared with other substances&mdash;such, for instance,
as rocks.<a name="FNanchor_12_415" id="FNanchor_12_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_415" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><i>The chemical properties of iron</i> have been already repeatedly
mentioned in preceding chapters. Iron <i>rusts</i> in air at the ordinary
temperature&mdash;that is to say, it becomes covered with a layer of iron
oxides. Here, without doubt, the moisture of the air plays a part,
because in dry air iron does not oxidise at all, and also because, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
particularly, ammonia is always found in iron rust; the ammonia must
arise from the action of the hydrogen of the water, at the moment of its
separation, on the nitrogen of the air. Highly-polished steel does not
rust nearly so readily, but if moistened with water, it easily becomes
coated with rust. As rust depends on the access of moisture, iron may
be preserved from rust by coating it with substances which prevent
the moisture having access to it. Thus arises the practice of covering
iron objects with paraffin,<a name="FNanchor_13_416" id="FNanchor_13_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_416" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> varnish, oil, paints, or enamelling it
with a glassy-looking flux possessing the same coefficient of expansion as
iron, or with a dense scoria (formed by the heat of superheated steam),
or with a compact coating of various metals. Wrought iron (both as
sheet iron and in other forms), cast iron, and steel are often coated with
tin, copper, lead, nickel, and similar metals, which prevent contact with
the air. These metals preserve iron very effectually from rust if they
form a completely compact surface, but in those places where the iron
becomes exposed, either accidentally or from wear, rust appears much
more quickly than on a uniform iron surface, because, towards these
metals (and also towards the rust), the iron will then behave as an
electro-positive pole in a galvanic couple, and hence will attract
oxygen. A coating of zinc does not produce this inconvenience, because
iron is electro-negative with reference to zinc, in consequence of which
galvanised iron does not easily rust, and even an iron boiler containing
some lumps of zinc rusts less than one without zinc.<a name="FNanchor_14_417" id="FNanchor_14_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_417" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Iron oxidises
at a high temperature, forming <i>iron scale</i>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, composed of ferrous
and ferric oxides, and, as has been seen, decomposes water and acids
with the evolution of hydrogen. It is also capable of decomposing
salts and oxides of other metals, which property is applied in the arts
for the extraction of copper, silver, lead, tin, &amp;c. For this reason
iron is soluble in the solutions of many salts&mdash;for instance, in cupric
sulphate, with precipitation of copper and formation of ferrous sulphate.<a name="FNanchor_15_418" id="FNanchor_15_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_418" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
When iron <i>acts on acids</i> it always <i>forms compounds</i> FeX<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
is, corresponding to the suboxide FeO&mdash;and answering to magnesium
compounds&mdash;and hence two atoms of hydrogen are replaced by one
atom of iron. Strongly oxidising acids like nitric acid may transform
the ferrous salt which is forming into the higher degree of oxidation or
ferric salt (corresponding with the sesquioxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), but this is a
secondary reaction. Iron, although easily soluble in dilute nitric acid,
loses this property when plunged into strong fuming nitric acid; after
this operation it even loses the property of solubility in other acids
until the external coating formed by the action of the strong nitric
acid is mechanically removed. This condition of iron is termed the
passive state. <i>The passive condition</i> of iron depends on the formation,
on its surface, of a coating of oxide due to the iron being acted on by
the lower oxides of nitrogen contained in the fuming nitric acid.<a name="FNanchor_16_419" id="FNanchor_16_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_419" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Strong nitric acid which does not contain these lower oxides, does not
render iron passive, but it is only necessary to add some alcohol or
other reducing agent which forms these lower oxides in the nitric acid,
and the iron will assume the passive state.</p>

<p>Iron readily combines with non-metals&mdash;for instance, with chlorine,
iodine, bromine, sulphur, and even with phosphorus and carbon; but
on the other hand the property of combining with metals is but little
developed in it&mdash;that is to say, it does not easily form alloys. Mercury,
which acts on most metals, does not act directly on iron, and the <i>iron
amalgam</i>, or solution of iron in mercury, which is used for electrical
machines, is only obtained in a particular way&mdash;namely, with the
co-operation of a sodium amalgam, in which the iron dissolves and by
means of which it is reduced from solutions of its salts.</p>

<p>When iron acts on acids it forms ferrous salts of the type FeX<sub>2</sub>,
and in the presence of air and oxidising agents they change by degrees
into ferric salts of the type FeX<sub>3</sub>. This faculty of passing from the
ferrous to the ferric state is still further developed in ferrous hydroxide.
If sodium hydroxide be added to a solution of ferrous sulphate or
green vitriol, FeSO<sub>4</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_17_420" id="FNanchor_17_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_420" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a white precipitate of ferrous hydroxide, FeH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
is obtained; but on exposure to the air, even under water, it turns
green, becomes grey, and finally turns brown, which is due to the
oxidation that it undergoes. Ferrous hydroxide is very sparingly
soluble in water; the solution has, however, a distinct alkaline reaction,
which is due to its being a fairly energetic basic oxide. In any case,
ferrous oxide is far more energetic than ferric oxide, so that if ammonia
be added to a solution containing a mixture of a ferrous and ferric
salt, at first ferric hydroxide only will be precipitated. If barium
carbonate, BaCO<sub>3</sub>, be shaken up in the cold with ferrous salts, it
does not precipitate them&mdash;that is, does not change them into ferrous
carbonate; but it completely separates all the iron from the ferric
salts in the cold, according to the equation Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 3BaCO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
= Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O + 3BaCl<sub>2</sub> + 3CO<sub>2</sub>. If ferrous hydroxide be boiled with
a solution of potash, the water is decomposed, hydrogen is evolved, and
the ferrous hydroxide is oxidised. The ferrous salts are in all respects
similar to the salts of magnesium and zinc; they are isomorphous
with them, but differ from them in that the ferrous hydroxide is not
soluble either in aqueous potash or ammonia. In the presence of an
excess of ammonium salts, however, a certain proportion of the iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
is not precipitated by alkalis and alkali carbonates, which fact points
to the formation of double ammonium salts.<a name="FNanchor_18_421" id="FNanchor_18_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_421" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The ferrous salts have
a dull <i>greenish</i> colour, and form solutions also of a pale green colour,
whilst the ferric salts have a <i>brown</i> or reddish-brown colour. The
ferrous salts, being capable of oxidation, form very active reducing
agents&mdash;for instance, under their action gold chloride, AuCl<sub>3</sub>, deposits
metallic gold, nitric acid is transformed into lower oxides, and the
highest oxides of manganese also pass into the lower forms of oxidation.
All these reactions take place with especial ease in the presence of an
excess of acid. This depends on the fact that the ferrous oxide, FeO
(or salt), acting as a reducing agent, turns into ferric oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (or
salt), and in the ferric state it requires more acid for the formation
of a normal salt than in the ferrous condition. Thus in the normal
ferrous sulphate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>, there is one equivalent of iron to one
equivalent of sulphur (in the sulphuric radicle), but in the neutral
ferric salt, Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, there is one equivalent of iron to one and a
half of sulphur in the form of the elements of sulphuric acid.<a name="FNanchor_19_422" id="FNanchor_19_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_422" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The most simple oxidising agent for transforming ferrous into ferric
salts is chlorine in the presence of water&mdash;for instance, 2FeCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
= Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, or, generally speaking, 2FeO + Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl.
When such a transformation is required it is best to add potassium
chlorate and hydrochloric acid to the ferrous solution; chlorine is
formed by their mutual reaction and acts as an oxidising agent.
Nitric acid produces a similar effect, although more slowly. Ferrous
salts may be completely and rapidly oxidised into ferric salts by means
of chromic acid or permanganic acid, HMnO<sub>4</sub>, in the presence of acids&mdash;for
example, 10FeSO<sub>4</sub> + 2KMnO<sub>4</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = 5Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 2MnSO<sub>4</sub>
+ K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O. This reaction is easily observed by the change of
colour, and its termination is easily seen, because potassium permanganate
forms solutions of a bright red colour, and when added to a
solution of a ferrous salt the above reaction immediately takes place <i>in
the presence of acid</i>, and the solution then becomes colourless, because all
the substances formed are only faintly coloured in solution. Directly all
the ferrous compound has passed into the ferric state, any excess of
permanganate which is added communicates a red colour to the liquid
(see Chapter <a href="#Page_276">XXI.</a>)</p>

<p>Thus when ferrous salts are acted on by oxidising agents, they pass
into the ferric form, and under the action of reducing agents the
reverse reaction occurs. Sulphuretted hydrogen may, for instance, be
used for this complete transformation, for under its influence ferric salts
are reduced with separation of sulphur&mdash;for example, Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S
= 2FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl + S. Sodium thiosulphate acts in a similar way:
Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2FeCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2HCl + S. Metallic
iron or zinc,<a name="FNanchor_20_423" id="FNanchor_20_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_423" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in the presence, of acids, or sodium amalgam, &amp;c.,
acts like hydrogen, and has also a similar reducing action, and this
furnishes the best method for reducing ferric salts to ferrous salts&mdash;for
instance, Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + Zn = 2FeCl<sub>2</sub> + ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. Thus <i>the transition from

<p><i>Ferric oxide</i>, or <i>sesquioxide of iron</i>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is found in nature,
and is artificially prepared in the form of a red powder by many
methods. Thus after heating green vitriol a red oxide of iron remains,
called colcothar, which is used as an oil paint, principally for painting
wood. The same substance in the form of a very fine powder (rouge)
is used for polishing glass, steel, and other objects. If a mixture of
ferrous sulphate with an excess of common salt be strongly heated,
crystalline ferric oxide will be formed, having a dark violet colour, and
resembling some natural varieties of this substance. When iron pyrites
is heated for preparing sulphurous anhydride, ferric oxide also remains
behind; it is used as a pigment. On the addition of alkalis to a
solution of ferric salts, a brown precipitate of ferric hydroxide is formed,
which when heated (even when boiled in water, that is, at about 100°,
according to Tomassi) easily parts with the water, and leaves red
anhydrous ferric oxide. Pure ferric oxide does not show any magnetic
properties, but when heated to a white heat it loses oxygen and is
converted into the magnetic oxide. Anhydrous ferric oxide which has
been heated to a high temperature is with difficulty soluble in acids
(but it is soluble when heated in strong acids, and also when fused with
potassium hydrogen sulphate), whilst ferric hydroxide, at all events
that which is precipitated from salts by means of alkalis, is very readily
soluble in acids. The precipitated <i>ferric hydroxide</i> has the composition
2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O, or Fe<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>9</sub>. If this ordinary hydroxide be rendered
anhydrous (at 100°), at a certain moment it becomes incandescent&mdash;that
is, loses a certain quantity of heat. This self-incandescence
depends on internal displacement produced by the transition of the
easily-soluble (in acids) variety into the difficultly-soluble variety,
and does not depend on the loss of water, since the anhydrous oxide
undergoes the same change. In addition to this there exists a ferric
hydroxide, or hydrated oxide of iron, which, like the strongly-heated
anhydrous iron oxide, is difficultly soluble in acids. This hydroxide on
losing water, or after the loss of water, does not undergo such self-incandescence,
because no such state of internal displacement occurs
(loss of energy or heat) with it as that which is peculiar to the ordinary
oxide of iron. The ferric hydroxide which is difficultly soluble in acids
has the composition Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. This hydroxide is obtained by a prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
ebullition of water in which ferric hydroxide prepared by the
oxidation of ferrous oxide is suspended, and also sometimes by similar
treatment of the ordinary hydroxide after it has been for a long time
in contact with water. The transition of one hydroxide to another is
apparent by a change of colour; the easily-soluble hydroxide is redder,
and the sparingly-soluble hydroxide more yellow in colour.<a name="FNanchor_22_425" id="FNanchor_22_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_425" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The normal salts of the composition Fe<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> or FeX<sub>3</sub> correspond
with ferric oxide&mdash;for example, the exceedingly volatile <i>ferric chloride</i>,
Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, which is easily prepared in the anhydrous state by the action
of chlorine on heated iron.<a name="FNanchor_23_426" id="FNanchor_23_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_426" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Such also is the <i>normal ferric nitrate</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a><br /><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Fe<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>; it is obtained by dissolving iron in an excess of nitric acid,
taking care as far as possible to prevent any rise of temperature.<a name="FNanchor_24_427" id="FNanchor_24_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_427" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The
normal salt separates from the brown solution when it is concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
under a bell jar over sulphuric acid. This salt, Fe<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O, then
crystallises in well-formed and perfectly colourless crystals,<a name="FNanchor_25_428" id="FNanchor_25_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_428" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> which
deliquesce in air, melt at 35°, and are soluble in and decomposed by
water. The decomposition may be seen from the fact that the solution
is brown and does not yield the whole of the salt again, but gives
partly basic salt. The normal salt (only stable in the presence of an
excess of HNO<sub>3</sub>) is completely decomposed with great facility by heating
with water, even at 130°, and this is made use of for removing iron
(and also certain other oxides of the form R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) from many other
bases (of the form RO) whose nitrates are far more stable. The ferric
salts, FeX<sub>3</sub>, in passing into ferrous salts, act as oxidising agents, as is
seen from the fact that they not only liberate S from SH<sub>2</sub>, but also
iodine from KI like many oxidising agents.<a name="FNanchor_25_BIS_429" id="FNanchor_25_BIS_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_BIS_429" class="fnanchor">[25 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>Iron forms one other oxide besides the ferric and ferrous oxides;
this contains twice as much oxygen as the former, but is so very
unstable that it can neither be obtained in the free state nor as a
hydrate. Whenever such conditions of double decomposition occur as
should allow of its separation in the free state, it decomposes into
oxygen and ferric oxide. It is known in the state of salts, and is only
stable in the presence of alkalis, and forms salts with them which have
a decidedly alkaline reaction; it is therefore a feebly acid oxide. Thus
when small pieces of iron are heated with nitre or potassium chlorate
a potassium salt of the composition K<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> is formed, and therefore
the hydrate corresponding with this salt should have the composition
H<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub>. It is called <i>ferric acid</i>. Its anhydride ought to contain
FeO<sub>3</sub> or Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>&mdash;twice as much oxygen as ferric oxide. If a solution
of potassium ferrate be mixed with acid, the free hydrate ought
to be formed, but it immediately decomposes (2K<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
= 2K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>3</sub>), oxygen being evolved. If a
small quantity of acid be taken, or if a solution of potassium ferrate
be heated with solutions of other metallic salts, ferric oxide is separated&mdash;for
instance:</p>

<p class="title">2CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 2K<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub> = 2K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2CuO.</p>

<p class="noindent">Both these oxides are of course deposited in the form of hydrates.
This shows that not only the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>FeO<sub>4</sub>, but also the salts of the
heavy metals corresponding with this higher oxide of iron, are not
formed by reactions of double decomposition. The solution of potassium
ferrate naturally acts as a powerful oxidising agent; for instance,
it transforms manganous oxide into the dioxide, sulphurous into
sulphuric acid, oxalic acid into carbonic anhydride and water, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_26_430" id="FNanchor_26_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_430" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Iron thus combines with oxygen in three proportions: RO, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
and RO<sub>3</sub>. It might have been expected that there would be intermediate
stages RO<sub>2</sub> (corresponding to pyrites FeS<sub>2</sub>) and R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, but for
iron these are unknown.<a name="FNanchor_26_BIS_431" id="FNanchor_26_BIS_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_BIS_431" class="fnanchor">[26 bis]</a> The lower oxide has a distinctly basic
character, the higher is feebly acid. The only one which is stable in
the free state is ferric oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; the suboxide, FeO, absorbs
oxygen, and ferric anhydride, FeO<sub>3</sub>, evolves it. It is also the same
for other elements; the character of each is determined by the relative
degree of stability of the known oxides. The salts FeX<sub>2</sub> correspond
with the suboxide, the salts FeX<sub>3</sub> or Fe<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> with the sesquioxide, and
FeX<sub>6</sub> represents those of ferric acid, as its potassium salt is FeO<sub>2</sub>(OK)<sub>2</sub>,
corresponding with K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c. Iron therefore
forms compounds of the types FeX<sub>2</sub>, FeX<sub>3</sub>, and FeX<sub>6</sub>, but this latter,
like the type NX<sub>5</sub>, does not appear separately, but only when X represents
heterogeneous elements or groups; for instance, for nitrogen
in the form of NO<sub>2</sub>(OH), NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, &amp;c., for iron in the form of
FeO<sub>2</sub>(OK)<sub>2</sub>. But still the type FeX<sub>6</sub> exists, and therefore FeX<sub>2</sub> and
FeX<sub>3</sub> are compounds which, like ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, are capable of further
combinations up to FeX<sub>6</sub>; this is also seen in the property of
ferrous and ferric salts of forming compounds with water of crystallisation,
besides double and basic salts, whose stability is determined by
the quality of the elements included in the types FeX<sub>2</sub> and FeX<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_26_TRI_432" id="FNanchor_26_TRI_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_TRI_432" class="fnanchor">[26 tri]</a>
It is therefore to be expected that there should be complex compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
derived from ferrous and ferric oxides. Amongst these the series
of cyanogen compounds is particularly interesting; their formation
and character is not only determined by the property which iron
possesses of forming complex types, but also by the similar faculty of
the cyanogen compounds, which, like nitriles (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_379">IX.</a>), have
clearly developed properties of polymerisation and in general of forming
complex compounds.<a name="FNanchor_27_433" id="FNanchor_27_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_433" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><i>In the cyanogen compounds of iron</i>, two degrees might be expected:
Fe(CN)<sub>2</sub>, corresponding with ferrous oxide, and Fe(CN)<sub>3</sub>, corresponding
with ferric oxide. There are actually, however, many other known
compounds, intermediate and far more complex. They correspond
with the double salts so easily formed by metallic cyanides. The two
following double salts are particularly well known, very stable, often
used, and easily prepared. <i>Potassium ferrocyanide</i> or <i>yellow prussiate
of potash</i>, a double salt of cyanide of potassium and ferrous cyanide,
has the composition FeC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>,4KCN; its crystals contain 3 mol. of water:
K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. The other is <i>potassium ferricyanide</i> or <i>red prussiate
of potash</i>. It is also known as <i>Gmelin's salt</i>, and contains cyanide of
potassium with ferric cyanide; its composition is Fe(CN)<sub>3</sub>,3KCN or
K<sub>3</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>. Its crystals do not contain water. It is obtained from
the first by the action of chlorine, which removes one atom of the
potassium. A whole series of other ferrocyanic compounds correspond
with these ordinary salts.</p>

<p>Before treating of the preparation and properties of these two
remarkable and very stable salts, it must be observed that with ordinary
reagents neither of them gives the same double decompositions
as the other ferrous and ferric salts, and they both present a series of
remarkable properties. Thus these salts have a neutral reaction, are
unchanged by air, dilute acids, or water, unlike potassium cyanide and
even some of its double salts. When solutions of these salts are treated
with caustic alkalis, they do not give a precipitate of ferrous or ferric
hydroxides, neither are they precipitated by sodium carbonate. This
led the earlier investigators to recognise special independent groupings
in them. The yellow prussiate was considered to contain the complex
radicle FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> combined with potassium, namely with K<sub>4</sub>, and K<sub>3</sub>
was attributed to the red prussiate. This was confirmed by the fact
that whilst in both salts any other metal, even hydrogen, might be
substituted for potassium, the iron remained unchangeable, just as
nitrogen in cyanogen, ammonium, and nitrates does not enter into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
double decomposition, being in the state of the complex radicles CN,
NH<sub>4</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>. Such a representation is, however, completely superfluous
for the explanation of the peculiarities in the reactions of such compounds
as double salts. If a magnesium salt which can be precipitated
by potassium hydroxide does not form a precipitate in the presence of
ammonium chloride, it is very clear that it is owing to the formation
of a soluble double salt which is not decomposed by alkalis. And
there is no necessity to account for the peculiarity of reaction of a
double salt by the formation of a new complex radicle. In the same
way also, in the presence of an excess of tartaric acid, cupric salts do
not form a precipitate with potassium hydroxide, because a double salt
is formed. These peculiarities are more easily understood in the case
of cyanogen compounds than in all others, because all cyanogen compounds,
as unsaturated compounds, show a marked tendency to
complexity. This tendency is satisfied in double salts. The appearance
of a peculiar character in double cyanides is the more easily
understood since in the case of potassium cyanide itself, and also in
hydrocyanic acid, a great many peculiarities have been observed
which are not encountered in those haloid compounds, potassium
chloride and hydrochloric acid, with which it was usual to compare
cyanogen compounds. These peculiarities become more comprehensible
on comparing cyanogen compounds with ammonium compounds. Thus
in the presence of ammonia the reactions of many compounds change
considerably. If in addition to this it is remembered that the
presence of many carbon (organic) compounds frequently completely
disturbs the reaction of salts, the peculiarities of certain double cyanides
will appear still less strange, because they contain carbon. The fact
that the presence of carbon or another element in the compound produces
a change in the reactions, may be compared to the action of
oxygen, which, when entering into a combination, also very materially
changes the nature of reactions. Chlorine is not detected by silver
nitrate when it is in the form of potassium chlorate, KClO<sub>3</sub>, as it is
detected in potassium chloride, KCl. The iron in ferrous and ferric
compounds varies in its reactions. In addition to the above-mentioned
facts, consideration ought to be given to the circumstance that the
easy mutability of nitric acid undergoes modification in its alkali
salts, and in general the properties of a salt often differ much from
those of the acid. Every double salt ought to be regarded as a peculiar
kind of saline compound: potassium cyanide is, as it were, a basic,
and ferrous cyanide an acid, element. They may be unstable in the
separate state, but form a stable double compound when combined
together; the act of combination disengages the energy of the elements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
and they, so to speak, saturate each other. Of course, all this is not a
definite explanation, but then the supposition of a special complex radicle
can even less be regarded as such.</p>

<p>Potassium ferrocyanide, K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, is very easily formed by mixing
solutions of ferrous sulphate and potassium cyanide. First, a white
precipitate of ferrous cyanide, FeC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, is formed, which becomes blue
on exposure to air, but is soluble in an excess of potassium cyanide,
forming the ferrocyanide. The same yellow prussiate is obtained on
heating animal nitrogenous charcoal or animal matters&mdash;such as
horn, leather cuttings, &amp;c.&mdash;with potassium carbonate in iron
vessels,<a name="FNanchor_27_BIS_434" id="FNanchor_27_BIS_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_BIS_434" class="fnanchor">[27 bis]</a> the mass formed being afterwards boiled with water with
exposure to air, potassium cyanide first appearing, which gives yellow
prussiate. The animal charcoal may be exchanged for wood charcoal,
permeated with potassium carbonate and heated in nitrogen or
ammonia; the mass thus produced is then boiled in water with ferric
oxide.<a name="FNanchor_28_435" id="FNanchor_28_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_435" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In this manner it is manufactured on the large scale, and is
called &lsquo;yellow prussiate&rsquo; (&lsquo;prussiate de potasse,&rsquo; Blutlaugensalz).</p>

<p>It is easy to substitute other metals for the potassium in the yellow
prussiate. The hydrogen salt or hydroferrocyanic acid, H<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, is
obtained by mixing strong solutions of yellow prussiate and hydrochloric
acid. If ether be added and the air excluded, the acid is
obtained directly in the form of a white scarcely crystalline precipitate
which becomes blue on exposure to air (as ferrous cyanide does from the
formation of blue compounds of ferrous and ferric cyanides, and it is
on this account used in cotton printing). It is soluble in water and
alcohol, but not in ether, has marked acid properties, and decomposes
carbonates, which renders it easily possible to prepare ferrocyanides of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
the metals of the alkalis and alkaline earths; these are readily soluble,
have a neutral reaction, and resemble the yellow prussiate. Solutions
of these salts form precipitates with the salts of other metals, because the
ferrocyanides of the heavy metals are insoluble. Here either the whole
of the potassium of the yellow prussiate, or only a part of it, is exchanged
for an equivalent quantity of the heavy metal. Thus, when a cupric
salt is added to a solution of yellow prussiate, a red precipitate is obtained
which still contains half the potassium of the yellow prussiate:</p>

<p class="title">K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> + CuSO<sub>4</sub> = K<sub>2</sub>CuFeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">But if the process be reversed (the salt of copper being then in excess)
the whole of the potassium will be exchanged for copper, forming a
reddish-brown precipitate, Cu<sub>2</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O. This reaction and
those similar to it are very sensitive and may be used for detecting
metals in solution, more especially as the colour of the precipitate
very often shows a marked difference when one metal is exchanged
for another. Zinc, cadmium, lead, antimony, tin, silver, cuprous and
aurous salts form <i>white</i> precipitates; cupric, uranium, titanium
and molybdenum salts <i>reddish-brown</i>; those of nickel, cobalt,
and chromium, <i>green</i> precipitates; <i>with ferrous salts</i>, ferrocyanide
forms, as has been already mentioned, a <i>white</i> precipitate&mdash;namely,
Fe<sub>2</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, or FeC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>&mdash;which turns blue on exposure to air, and
with ferric salts a <i>blue precipitate</i> called <i>Prussian blue</i>. Here the
potassium is replaced by iron, the reaction being expressed thus:
2Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 3K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> = 12KCl + Fe<sub>4</sub>Fe<sub>3</sub>C<sub>18</sub>N<sub>18</sub>, the latter formula
expressing the composition of Prussian blue. It is therefore the
compound 4Fe(CN)<sub>3</sub> + 3Fe(CN)<sub>2</sub>. The yellow prussiate is prepared in
chemical works on a large scale especially for the manufacture of this
blue pigment, which is used for dyeing cloth and other fabrics and
also as one of the ordinary blue paints. It is insoluble in water, and
the stuffs are therefore dyed by first soaking them in a solution of a
ferric salt and then in a solution of yellow prussiate. If however
an excess of yellow prussiate be present complete substitution between
potassium and iron does not occur, and <i>soluble Prussian blue</i> is
formed; KFe<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub> = KCN,Fe(CN)<sub>2</sub>,Fe(CN)<sub>3</sub>. This blue salt is
colloidal, is soluble in pure water, but insoluble and precipitated
when other salts&mdash;for instance, potassium or sodium chloride&mdash;are
present even in small quantities, and is therefore first obtained as a
precipitate.<a name="FNanchor_29_436" id="FNanchor_29_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_436" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>Potassium ferricyanide, or <i>red prussiate</i> of potash, K<sub>3</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, is
called &lsquo;Gmelin's salt,&rsquo; because this savant obtained it by the action
of chlorine on a solution of the yellow prussiate: K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> + Cl
= K<sub>3</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> + KCl. The reaction is due to the ferrous salt being
changed by the action of the chlorine into a ferric salt. It separates
from solutions in anhydrous, well-formed prisms of a red colour, but
the solution has an olive colour; 100 parts of water, at 10°, dissolve
37 parts of the salt, and at 100°, 78 parts.<a name="FNanchor_30_437" id="FNanchor_30_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_437" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The red prussiate
gives a blue precipitate with ferrous salts, called <i>Turnbull's blue</i>,
very much like Prussian blue (and the soluble variety), because it also
contains ferrous cyanide and ferric cyanide, although in another proportion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
being formed according to the equation: 3FeCl<sub>2</sub> + 2K<sub>3</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>
= 6KCl + Fe<sub>3</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub>12</sub>N<sub>12</sub>, or 3FeC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>,Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>; in Prussian blue we
have Fe<sub>7</sub>Cy<sub>18</sub>, and here Fe<sub>5</sub>Cy<sub>12</sub>. A ferric salt ought to form ferric
cyanide Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, with red prussiate, but ferric cyanide is soluble,
and therefore no precipitate is obtained, and the liquid only becomes
brown.<a name="FNanchor_31_438" id="FNanchor_31_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_438" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>If chlorine and sodium are representatives of independent groups
of elements, the same may also be said of iron. Its nearest analogues
show, besides a similarity in character, a likeness as regards
physical properties and a proximity in atomic weight. Iron occupies a
medium position amongst its nearest analogues, both with respect to
properties and faculty of forming saline oxides, and also as regards
atomic weight. On the one hand, cobalt, 58, and nickel, 59, approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
iron, 56; they are metals of a more basic character, they do not form
stable acids or higher degrees of oxidation, and are a transition to
copper, 63, and zinc, 65. On the other hand, manganese, 55, and
chromium, 52, are the nearest to iron; they form both basic and acid
oxides, and are a transition to the metals possessing acid properties.
In addition to having atomic weights approximately alike, chromium,
manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper have also nearly the same
specific gravity, so that the atomic volumes and the molecules of their
analogous compounds are also near to one another (see table at the
beginning of this volume). Besides this, the likeness between the
above-mentioned elements is also seen from the following:</p>

<p>They form suboxides, RO, fairly energetic bases, isomorphous with
magnesia&mdash;for instance, the salt RSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, akin to MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O,
and FeSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, or to sulphates containing less water; with alkali
sulphates all form double salts crystallising with 6H<sub>2</sub>O; all are capable
of forming ammonium salts, &amp;c. The lower oxides, in the cases of
nickel and cobalt, are tolerably stable, are not easily oxidised (the
nickel compound with more difficulty than cobalt, a transition to
copper); with manganese, and especially with chromium, they are
more easily oxidised than with iron and pass into higher oxides.
They also form oxides of the form R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and with nickel, cobalt,
and manganese this oxide is very unstable, and is more easily reduced
than ferric oxide; but, in the case of chromium, it is very stable, and
forms the ordinary kind of salts. It is isomorphous with ferric oxide,
forms alums, is a feeble base, &amp;c. Chromium, manganese, and iron are
oxidised by alkali and oxidising agents, forming salts like Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>;
but cobalt and nickel are difficult to oxidise; their acids are not known
with any certainty, and are, in all probability, still less stable than the
ferrates. Cr, Mn and Fe form compounds R<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> which are like Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>
in many respects; in Co this faculty is weaker and in Ni it has almost
disappeared. The cyanogen compounds, especially of manganese and
cobalt, are very near akin to the corresponding ferrocyanides. The
oxides of nickel and cobalt are more easily reduced to metal than those
of iron, but those of manganese and chromium are not reduced so
easily as iron, and the metals themselves are not easily obtained in a
pure state; they are capable of forming varieties resembling cast iron.
The metals Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni have a grey iron colour and are very
difficult to melt, but nickel and cobalt can be melted in the reverberatory
furnace and are more fusible than iron, whilst chromium is more
difficult to melt than platinum (Deville). These metals decompose
water, but with greater difficulty as the atomic weight rises, forming a
transition to copper, which does not decompose water. All the compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
of these metals have various colours, which are sometimes very
bright, especially in the higher stages of oxidation.</p>

<p>These metals of the iron group are often met with together in
nature. Manganese nearly everywhere accompanies iron, and iron is
always an ingredient in the ores of manganese. Chromium is found
principally as chrome ironstone&mdash;that is, a peculiar kind of magnetic
oxide in which Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is replaced by Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Nickel and cobalt are as inseparable companions as iron and
manganese. The similarity between them even extends to such
remote properties as magnetic qualities. In this series of metals we
find those which are the most magnetic: iron, cobalt, and nickel.
There is even a magnetic oxide among the chromium compounds, such
being unknown in the other series. Nickel easily becomes passive in
strong nitric acid. It absorbs hydrogen in just the same way as iron.
In short, in the series Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni, there are many points
in common although there are many differences, as will be seen still
more clearly on becoming acquainted with cobalt and nickel.</p>

<p>In nature <i>cobalt</i> is principally found in combination with arsenic
and sulphur. <i>Cobalt arsenide</i>, or <i>cobalt speiss</i>, CoAs<sub>2</sub>, is found in
brilliant crystals of the regular system, principally in Saxony. <i>Cobalt
glance</i>, CoAs<sub>2</sub>CoS<sub>2</sub>, resembles it very much, and also belongs to the
regular system; it is found in Sweden, Norway, and the Caucasus.
<i>Kupfernickel</i> is a nickel ore in combination with arsenic, but of a
different composition from cobalt arsenide, having the formula NiAs;
it is found in Bohemia and Saxony. It has a copper-red colour and is
rarely crystalline; it is so called because the miners of Saxony first
mistook it for an ore of copper (<i>Kupfer</i>), but were unable to extract
copper from it. <i>Nickel glance</i>, NiS<sub>2</sub>,NiAs<sub>2</sub>, corresponding with cobalt
glance, is also known. Nickel accompanies the ores of cobalt and
cobalt those of nickel, so that both metals are found together. The
ores of cobalt are worked in the Caucasus in the Government of
Elizavetopolsk. Nickel ores containing aqueous hydrated nickel silicate
are found in the Ural (Revdansk). Large quantities of a similar ore
are exported into Europe from New Caledonia. Both ores contain
about 12 per cent. Ni. <i>Garnierite</i>, (RO)<sub>5</sub>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>1&frac12;H<sub>2</sub>O, where R = Ni
and Mg, predominates in the New Caledonian ore. Large deposits of
nickel have been discovered in Canada, where the ore (as nickelous
pyrites) is free from arsenic. Cobalt is principally worked up into
cobalt compounds, but nickel is generally reduced to the metallic state, in
which it is now often used for alloys&mdash;for instance, for coinage in many
European States, and for plating other metals, because it does not
oxidise. Cobalt arsenide and cobalt glance are principally used for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
preparation of cobalt compounds; they are first sorted by discarding
the rocky matter, and then roasted. During this process most of the
sulphur and arsenic disappears; the arsenious anhydride volatilises
with the sulphurous anhydride and the metal also oxidises.<a name="FNanchor_32_439" id="FNanchor_32_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_439" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It is a
simple matter to obtain nickel and cobalt from their oxides. In order
to obtain the latter, solutions of their salts are treated with sodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
carbonate and the precipitated carbonates are heated; the suboxides
are thus obtained, and these latter are reduced in a stream of
hydrogen, or even by heating with ammonium chloride. They easily
oxidise when in the state of powder. When the chlorides of nickel
and cobalt are heated in a stream of hydrogen, the metal is deposited
in brilliant scales. <i>Nickel is always much more easily and quickly
reduced than cobalt.</i> Nickel melts more easily than cobalt, and this
even furnishes a means of testing the heating powers of a reverberatory
furnace. Cobalt fuses at a temperature only a little lower than that
at which iron does. In general, cobalt is nearer to iron than nickel,
nickel being nearer to copper.<a name="FNanchor_32_BIS_440" id="FNanchor_32_BIS_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_BIS_440" class="fnanchor">[32 bis]</a> Both nickel and cobalt have magnetic
properties like iron, but Co is less magnetic than Fe, and Ni still
less so. The specific gravity of nickel reduced by hydrogen is 9·1 and
that of cobalt 8·9. Fused cobalt has a specific gravity of 8·5, the
density of ordinary nickel being almost the same. Nickel has a greyish
silvery-white colour; it is brilliant and very ductile, so that the finest
wire may be easily drawn from it. This wire has a resistance to
tension equal to iron wire. The beautiful colour of nickel, and the
high polish which it is capable of receiving and retaining, as it does
not oxidise, render it a useful metal for many purposes, and in
many ways it resembles silver.<a name="FNanchor_32_TRI_441" id="FNanchor_32_TRI_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_TRI_441" class="fnanchor">[32 tri]</a> It is now very common to cover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
other metals with a layer of nickel (nickel plating). This is done by a
process of electro-plating, using a solution of a nickel salt. The
colour of cobalt is dark and redder; it is also ductile, and has a
greater tensile resistance than iron. Dilute acids act very slowly on
nickel and cobalt; nitric acid may be considered as the best solvent
for them. The solutions in every case contain salts corresponding with
the ferrous salts&mdash;that is, the <i>salts</i> CoX<sub>2</sub>, NiX<sub>2</sub>, <i>correspond with the
suboxides</i> of these metals. These salts in their types are similar to the
magnesium salts. The salts of nickel when crystallising with water
have a green colour, and form bright green solutions, but in the anhydrous
state they most frequently have a yellow colour. The salts of
cobalt are generally rose-coloured, and generally blue when in the
anhydrous state. Their aqueous solutions are rose-coloured. Cobaltous
chloride is easily soluble in alcohol, and forms a solution of an intense
blue colour.<a name="FNanchor_33_442" id="FNanchor_33_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_442" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>If a solution of potassium hydroxide be added to a solution of a
cobalt salt, a blue precipitate of the basic salt will be formed. If a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
solution of a cobalt salt be heated almost to the boiling-point, and the
solution be then mixed with a boiling solution of an alkali hydroxide,
a <i>pink precipitate of cobaltous hydroxide</i>, CoH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, will be formed. If
air be not completely excluded during the precipitation by boiling, the
precipitate will also contain brown cobaltic hydroxide formed by the
further oxidation of the cobaltous oxide.<a name="FNanchor_34_443" id="FNanchor_34_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_443" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Under similar circumstances
nickel salts form <i>a green precipitate of nickelous hydroxide</i>, the formation
of which is not hindered by the presence of ammonium salts, but
in that case only requires more alkali to completely separate the
nickel. The nickelous oxide obtained by heating the hydroxide, or
from the carbonate or nitrate, is a grey powder, easily soluble in acids
and easily reduced, but the same substance may be obtained in the
crystalline form as an ordinary product from the ores; it crystallises
in regular octahedra, with a metallic lustre, and is of a grey colour.
In this state the nickelous oxide almost resists the action of acids.<a name="FNanchor_34_BIS_444" id="FNanchor_34_BIS_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_BIS_444" class="fnanchor">[34 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>It is interesting to note <i>the relation</i> of the cobaltous and nickelous
hydroxides <i>to ammonia</i>; aqueous ammonia dissolves the precipitate of
cobaltous and nickelous hydroxide. The blue ammoniacal solution of
nickel resembles the same solution of cupric oxide, but has a somewhat
reddish tint. It is characterised by the fact that it dissolves silk in
the same way as the ammoniacal cupric oxide dissolves cellulose. Ammonia
likewise dissolves the precipitate of cobaltous hydroxide, forming
a brownish liquid, which becomes darker in air and finally assumes a
bright red hue, absorbing oxygen. The admixture of ammonium chloride
prevents the precipitation of cobalt salts by ammonia; when the ammonia
is added, a brown solution is obtained from which, as in the
case of the preceding solution, potassium hydroxide does not separate
the cobaltous oxide. Peculiar compounds are produced in this solution;
they are comparatively stable, containing ammonia and an excess of
oxygen; they bear the name cobaltoamine and cobaltiamine salts. They
have been principally investigated by Genth, Frémy, Jörgenson and
others. Genth found that when a cobalt salt, mixed with an excess of
ammonium chloride, is treated with ammonia and exposed to the air,
after a certain lapse of time, on adding hydrochloric acid and boiling,
a red powder is precipitated and the remaining solution contains an
orange salt. The study of these compounds led to the discovery of a
whole series of similar salts, some of which correspond with particular
higher degrees of oxidation of cobalt, which are described later.<a name="FNanchor_35_445" id="FNanchor_35_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_445" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a><br /><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a><br /><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a><br /><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a><br /><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a><br /><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Nickel does not possess this property of absorbing the oxygen of the air
when in an ammoniacal solution. In order to understand this distinction,
and in general the relation of nickel, it is important to observe
that cobalt more easily forms a higher degree of oxidation&mdash;namely,
<i>sesquioxide of cobalt</i>, <i>cobaltic oxide</i>, Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;than nickel, especially in
the presence of hypochlorous acid. If a solution of a cobalt salt be
mixed with barium carbonate and an excess of hypochlorous acid be
added, or chlorine gas be passed through it, then at the ordinary
temperature on shaking, the whole of the cobalt will be separated
in the form of black cobaltic oxide: 2CoSO<sub>4</sub> + ClHO + 2BaCO<sub>3</sub>
= Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2BaSO<sub>4</sub> + HCl + 2CO<sub>2</sub>. Under these circumstances nickelous
oxide does not immediately form black sesquioxide, but after a considerable
space of time it also separates in the form of sesquioxide, Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
but always later than cobalt. This is due to the relative difficulty of
further oxidation of the nickelous oxide. It is, however, possible to
oxidise it; if, for instance, the hydroxide NiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> be shaken in water
and chlorine gas be passed through it, then nickel chloride will be
formed, which is soluble in water, and insoluble nickelic oxide in the
form of a black precipitate: 3NiH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> = NiCl<sub>2</sub> + Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O.
Nickelic oxide may also be obtained by adding sodium hypochlorite
mixed with alkali to a solution of a nickel salt. Nickelic and cobaltic
hydrates are black. Nickelic oxide evolves oxygen with all acids, and
in consequence of this it is not separated as a precipitate in the presence
of acids; thus it evolves chlorine with hydrochloric acid, exactly like
manganese dioxide. When nickelic oxide is dissolved in aqueous
ammonia it liberates nitrogen, and an ammoniacal solution of nickelous
oxide is formed. When heated, nickelic oxide loses oxygen, forming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
nickelous oxide. Cobaltic oxide, Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, exhibits more stability than
nickelic oxide, and shows feeble basic properties; thus it is dissolved
in acetic acid without the evolution of oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_35_BIS_446" id="FNanchor_35_BIS_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_BIS_446" class="fnanchor">[35 bis]</a> But ordinary acids,
especially on heating, evolve oxygen, forming a solution of a cobaltous
salt. The presence of a cobaltic salt in a solution of a cobaltous salt
may be detected by the brown colour of the solution and the black
precipitate formed by the addition of alkali, and also from the fact that
such solutions evolve chlorine when heated with hydrochloric acid.
Cobaltic oxide may not only be prepared by the above-mentioned
methods, but also by heating cobalt nitrate, after which a steel-coloured
mass remains which retains traces of nitric acid, but when heated
further to incandescence evolves oxygen, leaving a compound of
cobaltic and cobaltous oxides, similar to magnetic ironstone. Cobalt
(but not nickel) undoubtedly forms besides Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> a <i>dioxide</i> CoO<sub>2</sub>.
This is obtained<a name="FNanchor_36_447" id="FNanchor_36_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_447" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> when the cobaltous oxide is oxidised by iodine or
peroxide of barium.<a name="FNanchor_37_448" id="FNanchor_37_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_448" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Nickel alloys possess qualities which render them valuable for
technical purposes, the alloy of nickel with iron being particularly
remarkable. This alloy is met with in nature as <i>meteoric iron</i>. The
Pallasoffsky mass of meteoric iron, preserved in the St. Petersburg
Academy, fell in Siberia in the last century; it weighs about 15 cwt.
and contains 88 p.c. of iron and about 10 p.c. of nickel, with a
small admixture of other metals. In the arts <i>German silver</i> is most
extensively used; it is an alloy containing nickel, copper, and zinc in
various proportions. It generally consists of about 50 parts of copper,
25 parts of zinc, and 25 parts of nickel. This alloy is characterised by
its white colour resembling that of silver, and, like this latter metal, it
does not rust, and therefore furnishes an excellent substitute for silver
in the majority of cases where it is used. Alloys which contain silver
in addition to nickel show the properties of silver to a still greater
extent. Alloys of nickel are used for currency, and if rich deposits of
nickel are discovered a wide field of application lies before it, not only
in a pure state (because it is a beautiful metal and does not rust) but
also for use in alloys. Steel vessels (pressed or forged out of sheet
steel) covered with nickel have such practical merits that their manufacture,
which has not long commenced, will most probably be rapidly
developed, whilst nickel steel, which exceeds ordinary steel in its
tenacity, has already proved its excellent qualities for many purposes
(for instance, for armour plate).</p>

<p>Until 1890 no compound of cobalt or nickel was known of sufficient
volatility to determine the molecular weights of the compounds of these
metals; but in 1890 Mr. L. Mond, in conducting (together with Langer
and Quincke) his researches on the action of nickel upon carbonic oxide
(Chapter IX., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_24_BIS_537">24 bis</a>), observed that nickel gradually volatilises in
a stream of carbonic oxide; this only takes place at low temperatures,
and is seen by the coloration of the flame of the carbonic oxide. This
observation led to the discovery of a remarkable volatile <i>compound of
nickel and carbonic oxide</i>, having as molecular composition Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_38_449" id="FNanchor_38_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_449" class="fnanchor">[38]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
as determined by the vapour density and depression of the freezing
point. Cobalt and many other metals do not form volatile compounds
under these conditions, but iron gives a similar product (Note <a href="#Footnote_26_BIS_431">26 bis</a>).
Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> is prepared by taking finely divided Ni (obtained by reducing
NiO by heating it in a stream of hydrogen, or by igniting the oxalate
NiC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<a name="FNanchor_39_450" id="FNanchor_39_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_450" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and passing (at a temperature below 50°, for even at 60°
decomposition may take place and an explosion) a stream of CO over
it; the latter carries over the vapour of the compound, which condenses
(in a well-cooled receiver) into a perfectly colourless extremely mobile
liquid, boiling without decomposition at 43°, and crystallising in needles
at -25° (Mond and Nasini, 1891). Liquid Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> has a sp. gr. 1·356
at 0°, is insoluble in water, dissolves in alcohol and benzene, and burns
with a very smoky flame due to the liberation of Ni. The vapour when
passed through a tube heated to 180° and above deposits a brilliant
coating of metal, and disengages CO. If the tube be strongly heated
the decomposition is accompanied by an explosion. If Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> as
vapour be passed through a solution of CuCl<sub>2</sub>, it reduces the latter to
metal; it has the same action upon an ammoniacal solution of AgCl, strong
nitric acid oxidises Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>, dilute solutions of acids have no action;
if the vapour be passed through strong sulphuric acid, CO is liberated,
chlorine gives NiCl and COCl<sub>2</sub>; no simple reactions of double decomposition
are yet known for Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>, however, so that its connection
with other carbon compounds is not clear. Probably the formation of
this compound could be applied for extracting nickel from its ores.<a name="FNanchor_40_451" id="FNanchor_40_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_451" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

this branch of astronomy, due to Schiaparelli, has a bearing on the whole of natural
science.</p>

<p>The question arises as to why the iron in meteorites is in a free state, whilst on earth
it is in a state of combination. Does not this tend to show that the condition of our
globe is very different from that of the rest? My answer to this question has been
already given in Volume I. p. 377, Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_57_504">57</a>. It is my opinion that inside the earth there
is a mass similar in composition to meteorites&mdash;that is, containing rocky matter and
metallic iron, partly carburetted. In conclusion, I consider it will not be out of place
to add the following explanations. According to the theory of the distribution of pressures
(see my treatise, <i>On Barometrical Levelling</i>, 1876, pages 48 <i>et seq.</i>) in an atmosphere
of mixed gases, it follows that two gases, whose densities are <i>d</i> and <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>, and whose
relative quantities or partial pressures at a certain distance from the centre of gravity
are <i>h</i> and <i>h</i><sub>1</sub>, will, when at a greater distance from the centre of attraction, present a
different ratio of their masses <i>x</i> : <i>x</i><sub>1</sub>&mdash;that is, of their partial pressures&mdash;which may be
found by the equation <i>d</i><sub>1</sub>(log(<i>h</i>) - log(<i>x</i>)) = <i>d</i>(log(<i>h</i><sub>1</sub>) - log(<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>)). If, for instance, <i>d</i> : <i>d</i><sub>1</sub> = 2 : 1,
and <i>h</i> = <i>h</i><sub>1</sub> (that is to say, the masses are equal at the lower height) = 1000, then when
<i>x</i> = 10 the magnitude of <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> will not be 10 (<i>i.e.</i> the mass of a gas at a higher level whose
density = 1 will not be equal to the mass of a gas whose density = 2, as was the case at
a lower level), but much greater&mdash;namely, <i>x</i><sub>1</sub> = 100&mdash;that is, the lighter gas will predominate
over a heavier one at a higher level. Therefore, when the whole mass of the
earth was in a state of vapour, the substances having a greater vapour density accumulated
about the centre and those with a lesser vapour density at the surface. And as
the vapour densities depend on the atomic and molecular weights, those substances which
have small atomic and molecular weights ought to have accumulated at the surface, and
those with high atomic and molecular weights, which are the least volatile and the easiest
to condense, at the centre. Thus it becomes apparent why such light elements as
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sodium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus,
sulphur, chlorine, potassium, calcium, and their compounds predominate at the surface
and largely form the earth's crust. There is also now much iron in the sun, as spectrum
analysis shows, and therefore it must have entered into the composition of the earth
and other planets, but would have accumulated at the centre, because the density of
its vapour is certainly large and it easily condenses. There was also oxygen near the
centre of the earth, but not sufficient to combine with the iron. The former, as a much
lighter element, principally accumulated at the surface, where we at the present time
find all oxidised compounds and even a remnant of free oxygen. This gives the
possibility not only of explaining in accordance with cosmogonic theories the predominance
of oxygen compounds on the surface of the earth, with the occurrence of
unoxidised iron in the interior of the earth and in meteorites, but also of understanding
why the density of the whole earth (over 5) is far greater than that of the rocks (1 to 3)
composing its crust. And if all the preceding arguments and theories (for instance
the supposition that the sun, earth, and all the planets were formed of an elementary
homogeneous mass, formerly composed of vapours and gases) be true, it must be admitted
that the interior of the earth and other planets contains metallic (unoxidised) iron,
which, however, is only found on the surface as aerolites. And then assuming that
aerolites are the fragments of planets which have crumbled to pieces so to say
during cooling (this has been held to be the case by astronomers, judging from the paths
of aerolites), it is readily understood why they should be composed of metallic
iron, and this would explain its occurrence in the depths of the earth, which we
assumed as the basis of our theory of the formation of naphtha (Chapter VIII., Notes <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_57_504">57&ndash;60</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_BIS_404" id="Footnote_2_BIS_404"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_BIS_404"><span class="label">[2 bis]</span></a> Immense deposits of iron pyrites are known in various parts of Russia. On the
river Msta, near Borovitsi, thousands of tons are yearly collected from the detritus of
the neighbouring rocks. In the Governments of Toula, Riazan, and in the Donets district
continuous layers of pyrites occur among the coal seams. Very thick beds of pyrites
are also known in many parts of the Caucasus. But the deposits of the Urals are particularly
vast, and have been worked for a long time. Amongst these I will only indicate
the deposits on the Soymensky estate near the Kishteimsky works; the Kaletinsky
deposits near the Virhny-Isetsky works (containing 1&ndash;2 p.c. Cu); on the banks of the
river Koushaivi near Koushvi (3&ndash;5 p.c. Cu), and the deposits near the Bogoslovsky
works (3&ndash;5 p.c. Cu). Iron pyrites (especially that containing copper which is extracted
after roasting) is now chiefly employed for roasting, as a source of SO<sub>2</sub>, for the manufacture
of chamber sulphuric acid (Vol. I. p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_291">291</a>), but the remaining oxide of iron is perfectly
suitable for smelting into pig iron, although it gives a sulphurous pig iron (the
sulphur may be easily removed by subsequent treatment, especially with the aid of
ferro-manganese in Bessemer's process). The great technical importance of iron pyrites
leads to its sometimes being imported from great distances; for instance, into England
from Spain. Besides which, when heated in closed retorts FeS<sub>2</sub> gives sulphur, and if
allowed to oxidise in damp air, green vitriol, FeSO<sub>4</sub>.</p></div>

special sorting apparatus (generally acting with water to wash the ore), and is subjected
to roasting and other treatment. In every case the ore contains foreign matter. In the
extraction of iron, which is one of the cheapest metals, the dressing of an ore is in most
cases unprofitable, and only ores rich in metal are worked&mdash;namely, those containing at
least 20 p.c. It is often profitable to transport very rich and pure ores (with as much as

precipitated ferric oxide is reduced by hydrogen at 85°, that obtained by oxidising the

by carbonic oxide commences earlier than that by hydrogen, and the reduction by
hydrogen still earlier than that by charcoal; (<i>c</i>) the reduction is effected with greater
facility when a greater quantity of heat is evolved during the reaction. Ferric oxide
obtained by heating ferrous sulphate to a red heat begins to be reduced by carbonic

in hearths resembling smiths' fires. As evidenced by the uninterrupted action
of the steam boiler, or the process of lime burning, and the continuous preparation and
condensation of sulphuric acid or the uninterrupted smelting of iron, every industrial
process becomes increasingly profitable and complete under the condition of the continuous
action, as far as possible, of all agencies concerned in the production. This
continuous method of production is the first condition for the profitable production
on the large scale of nearly all industrial products. This method lessens the cost of
labour, simplifies the supervision of the work, renders the product uniform, and frequently
introduces a very great economy in the expenditure of fuel and at the same time
presents the simplicity and perfection of an equilibrated system. Hence every manufacturing
operation should be a continuous one, and the manufacture of pig iron and
sulphuric acid, which have long since become so, may be taken as examples in many
respects. A study of these two manufactures should form the commencement of an
acquaintance with all the contemporary methods of manufacturing both from a technical
and economical point of view.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_409" id="Footnote_7_409"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_409"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The composition of slag suitable for iron smelting most often approaches the
following: 50 to 60 p.c. SiO<sub>2</sub>, 5 to 20 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, the rest of the mass consisting of MgO,
CaO, MnO, FeO. Thus the most fusible slag (according to the observations of
Bodeman) contains the alloy Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,4CaO,7SiO<sub>2</sub>. On altering the quantity of magnesia
and lime, and especially of the alkalis (which increases the fusibility) and of silica
(which decreases it), the temperature of fusion changes with the relation between the total
quantity of oxygen and that in the silica. Slags of the composition RO,SiO<sub>2</sub> are easily
fusible, have a vitreous appearance, and are very common. Basic slags approach the
composition 2RO,SiO<sub>2</sub>. Hence, knowing the composition and quantity of the foreign
matter in the ore, it is at once easy to find the quantity and quality of the flux which
must be added to form a suitable slag. The smelting of iron is rendered more complex
by the fact that the silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, which enters into the slag and fluxes is capable of forming
a slag with the iron oxides. In order that the least quantity of iron may pass into
the slag, it is necessary for it to be reduced before the temperature is attained at which
the slags are formed (about 1000°), which is effected by reducing the iron, not with charcoal
itself, but with carbonic oxide. From this it will be understood how the progress of
the whole treatment may be judged by the properties of the slags. Details of this
complicated and well-studied subject will be found in works on metallurgy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_410" id="Footnote_8_410"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_410"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The section of a blast furnace is represented by two truncated cones joined at their
bases, the upper cone being longer than the lower one; the lower cone is terminated by
the hearth, or almost cylindrical cavity in which the cast iron and slag collect, one
side being provided with apertures for drawing off the iron and slag. The air is blown
into the blast furnace through special pipes, situated over the hearth, as shown in the
section. The air previously passes through a series of cast-iron pipes, heated by the
combustion of the carbonic oxide obtained from the upper parts of the furnace, where
it is formed as in a &lsquo;gas-producer.&rsquo; The blast furnace acts continuously until it is worn
out; the iron is tapped off twice a day, and the furnace is allowed to cool a little from
time to time so as not to be spoilt by the increasing heat, and to enable it to withstand
long usage.</p>

<p>Blast furnaces worked with charcoal fuel are not so high, and in general give a
smaller yield than those using coke, because the latter are worked with heavier charges
than those in which charcoal is employed. Coke furnaces yield 20,000 tons and over of pig
iron a year. In the United States there are blast furnaces 30 metres high, and upwards
of 600 cubic metres capacity, yielding as much as 130,000 tons of pig iron, requiring a blast
of about 750 cubic metres of air per minute, heated to 600°, and consuming about 0·85
part of coke per 1 part of pig iron produced. At the present time the world produces as
much as 30 million tons of pig iron a year, about 9/10 of which is converted into wrought
iron and steel. The chief producers are the United States (about 10 million tons a year)
and England (about 9 million tons a year); Russia yields about 1&#8533; million tons a year.
The world's production has doubled during the last 20 years, and in this respect the
United States have outrun all other countries. The reason of this increase of production
must be looked for in the increased demand for iron and steel for railway purposes, for
structures (especially ship-building), and in the fact that: (<i>a</i>) the cost of pig iron has
fallen, thanks to the erection of large furnaces and a fuller study of the processes taking
place in them, and (<i>b</i>) that every kind of iron ore (even sulphurous and phosphoritic) can
now be converted into a homogeneous steel.</p>

fire-brick. It is closed at the top by a &lsquo;cap and cone&rsquo; arrangement, by means of which

<p>In order to more thoroughly grasp the chemical process which takes place in blast
furnaces, it is necessary to follow the course of the material charged in at the top and of
the air passing through the furnace. From 50 to 200 parts of carbon are expended on 100
parts of iron. The ore, flux, and coke are charged into the top of the furnace, in
layers, as the cast iron is formed in the lower parts and flowing down to the bottom
causes the whole contents of the furnace to subside, thus forming an empty space at
the top, which is again filled up with the afore-mentioned mixture. During its downward
course this mixture is subjected to increasing heat. This rise of temperature
first drives off the moisture of the ore mixture, and then leads to the formation of
the products of the dry distillation of coal or charcoal. Little by little the subsiding
mass attains a temperature at which the heated carbon reacts with the carbonic anhydride
passing upwards through the furnace and transforms it into carbonic oxide. This is
the reason why carbonic anhydride is not evolved from the furnace, but only carbonic
oxide. As regards the ore itself, on being heated to about 600° to 800° it is reduced at
the expense of the carbonic oxide ascending the furnace, and formed by the contact of
the carbonic anhydride with the incandescent charcoal, so that the reduction in the blast
furnace is without doubt brought about <i>by</i> the formation and decomposition of <i>carbonic
oxide</i> and not by carbon itself&mdash;thus, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3CO = Fe<sub>2</sub> + 3CO<sub>2</sub>. The reduced iron, on
further subsidence and contact with carbon, forms cast iron, which flows to the bottom
of the furnace. In these lower layers, where the temperature is highest (about 1,300°),
the foreign matter of the ore finally forms slag, which also is fusible, with the aid of
fluxes. The air blown in from below, through the so-called <i>tuyeres</i>, encounters carbon
in the lower layers of the furnace, and burns it, converting it into carbonic anhydride.
It is evident that this develops the highest temperature in these lower layers of the
furnace, because here the combustion of the carbon is effected by heated and compressed
air. This is very essential, for it is by virtue of this high temperature that the
process of forming the slag and of forming and fusing the cast iron are effected
simultaneously in these lower portions of the furnace. The carbonic acid formed in
these parts rises higher, encounters incandescent carbon, and forms with it carbonic
oxide. This heated carbonic oxide acts as a reducing agent on the iron ore, and is reconverted
by it into carbonic anhydride; this gas meets with more carbon, and again
forms carbonic oxide, which again acts as a reducing agent. The final transformation
of the carbonic anhydride into carbonic oxide is effected in those parts of the furnace
where the reduction of the oxides of iron does not take place, but where the temperature
is still high enough to reduce the carbonic anhydride. The ascending mixture of
carbonic oxide and nitrogen, CO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., is then withdrawn through special lateral
apertures formed in the upper cold parts of the furnace walls, and is conducted through
pipes to those stoves which are used for heating the air, and also sometimes into other
furnaces used for the further processes of iron manufacture. The fuel of blast furnaces
consists of wood charcoal (this is the most expensive material, but the pig iron produced
is the purest, because charcoal does not contain any sulphur, while coke does),
anthracite (for instance, in Pennsylvania, and in Russia at Pastouhoff's works in the
Don district), coke, coal, and even wood and peat. It must be borne in mind that the
utilisation of naphtha and naphtha refuse would probably give very profitable results
in metallurgical processes.</p>

<p>The process just described is accompanied by a series of other processes. Thus, for
instance, in the blast furnace a considerable quantity of cyanogen compounds are formed.
This takes place because the nitrogen of the air blast comes into contact with incandescent
carbon and various alkaline matters contained in the foreign matter of the ores.
A considerable quantity of potassium cyanide is formed when wood charcoal is employed
for iron smelting, as its ash is rich in potash.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_411" id="Footnote_9_411"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_411"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The specific gravity of white cast iron is about 7·5. Grey cast iron has a much lower
specific gravity, namely, 7·0. Grey cast iron generally contains less manganese and
more silica than white; but both contain from 2 to 3 p.c. of carbon. The difference
between the varieties of cast iron depends on the condition of the carbon which
enters into the composition of the iron. In white cast iron the carbon is in combination
with the iron&mdash;in all probability, as the compound CFe<sub>4</sub> (Abel and Osmond and others
extracted this compound, which is sometimes called &lsquo;carbide,&rsquo; from tempered steel,
which stands to unannealed steel as white cast iron does to grey), but perhaps in the state
of an indefinite chemical compound resembling a solution. In any case the compound of
the iron and carbon in white cast iron is chemically very unstable, because when slowly
cooled it decomposes, with separation of graphite, just as a solution when slowly cooled
yields a portion of the substance dissolved. The separation of carbon in the form of
graphite on the conversion of white cast iron into grey is never complete, however slowly
the separation be carried on; part of the carbon remains in combination with the
iron in the same state in which it exists in white cast iron. Hence when grey cast iron is
treated with acids, the whole of the carbon does not remain in the form of graphite, but a
part of it is separated as hydrocarbons, which proves the existence of chemically-combined
carbon in grey cast iron. It is sufficient to re-melt grey cast iron and to cool it quickly to
transform it into white cast iron. It is not carbon alone that influences the properties of
cast iron; when it contains a considerable amount of sulphur, cast iron remains white
even after having been slowly cooled. The same is observed in cast iron very rich in
manganese (5 to 7 p.c.), and in this latter case the fracture is very distinctly crystalline
and brilliant. When cast iron contains a large amount of manganese, the quantity of
carbon may also be increased. Crystalline varieties of cast iron rich in manganese are in
practice called ferro-manganese (p. <a href="#Page_310">310</a>), and are prepared for the Bessemer process.
Grey cast iron not having an uniform structure is much more liable to various changes
than dense and thoroughly uniform white cast iron, and the latter oxidises much more
slowly in air than the former. White cast iron is not only used for conversion into wrought
iron and steel, but also in those cases where great hardness is required, although it be accompanied
by a certain brittleness; for instance, for making rollers, plough-shares, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_412" id="Footnote_10_412"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_412"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This direct process of separating the carbon from cast iron is termed <i>puddling</i>. It
is conducted in reverberatory furnaces. The cast iron is placed on the bed of the
furnace and melted; through a special aperture, the puddler stirs up the oxidising mass
of cast iron, pressing the oxides into the molten iron. This resembles kneading dough,
and the process introduced in England became known as puddling. It is evident that
the puddled mass, or bloom, is a heterogeneous substance obtained by mixing, and
hence one part of the mass will still be rich in carbon, another will be poor, some parts
will contain oxide not reduced, &amp;c. The further treatment of the puddled mass consists
in hammering and drawing it out into flat pieces, which on being hammered become
more homogeneous, and when several pieces are welded together and again hammered
out a still more homogeneous mass is obtained. The quality of the steel and iron thus
formed depends principally on their uniformity. The want of uniformity depends on
the oxides remaining inside the mass, and on the variable distribution of the carbon
throughout the mass. In order to obtain a more homogeneous metal for manufacturing
articles out of steel, it is drawn into thin rods, which are tied together in
bundles and then again hammered out. As an example of what may be attained in this
direction, imitation Damascus steel may be cited; it consists of twisted and plaited
wire, which is then hammered into a dense mass. (Real damascened wootz steel
may be made by melting a mixture of the best iron with graphite (<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub>) and iron rust;
the article is then corroded with acid, and the carbon remains in the form of a pattern.)</p>

<p>Steel and wrought iron are manufactured from cast iron by puddling. They are, however,
obtained not only by this method but also by the <i>bloomery process</i>, which is carried
out in a fire similar to a blacksmith's forge, fed with charcoal and provided with a blast;
a pig of cast iron is gradually pushed into the fire, and portions of it melt and fall to the
bottom of the hearth, coming into contact with an air blast, and are thus oxidised. The
bloom thus formed is then squeezed and hammered. It is evident that this process is
only available when the charcoal used in the fire does not contain any foreign matter
which might injure the quality of the iron or steel&mdash;for instance, sulphur or phosphorus&mdash;and
therefore only wood charcoal may be used with impunity, from which it follows
that this process can only be carried on where the manufacture of iron can be conducted
with this fuel. Coal and coke contain the above-mentioned impurities, and would
therefore produce iron of a brittle nature, and thus it would be necessary to have
recourse to puddling, where the fuel is burnt on a special hearth, separate from the
cast iron, whereby the impurities of the fuel do not come into contact with it. The
manufacture of steel from cast iron may also be conducted in fires; but, in addition to
this, it is also now prepared by many other methods. One of the long-known processes
is called <i>cementation</i>, by which steel is prepared from wrought iron but not from cast
iron. For this process strips of iron are heated red-hot for a considerable time whilst
immersed in powdered charcoal; during this operation the iron at the surface combines
with the charcoal, which however does not penetrate; after this the iron strips are
re-forged, drawn out again, and cemented anew, repeating this process until a steel of the
desired quality is formed&mdash;that is, containing the requisite proportion of carbon. The
<i>Bessemer</i> process occupies the front rank among the newer methods (since 1856); it
is so called from the name of its inventor. This process consists in running melted
cast iron into converters (holding about 6 tons of cast iron)&mdash;that is, egg-shaped
receivers, fig. <a href="#fig_94">94</a>, capable of revolving on trunnions (in order to charge in the
cast iron and discharge the steel), and forcing a stream of air through small apertures
at a considerable pressure. Combustion of the iron and carbon at an elevated temperature
then takes place, resulting from the bubbles of oxygen thus penetrating the mass
of the cast iron. The carbon, however, burns to a greater extent than the iron, and
therefore a mass is obtained which is much poorer in carbon than cast iron. As the
combustion proceeds very rapidly in the mass of metal, the temperature rises to such an
extent that even the wrought iron which may be formed remains in a molten condition,
whilst the steel, being more fusible than the wrought iron, remains very liquid. In
half an hour the mass is ready. The purest possible cast iron is used in the Bessemer
process, because sulphur and phosphorus do not burn out like carbon, silicon, and
manganese.</p>

by the tubes, L, O, D to the bottom, M, from which it passes by a number of holes into the converter.
The converter is rotated on the trunnion <i>d</i> by means of the rack and pinion H, when it
is required either to receive molten cast iron from the melting furnaces or to pour out the steel.</p></div>

<p>The presence of manganese enables the sulphur to be removed with the slag, and the
presence of lime or magnesia, which are introduced into the lining of the converter,
facilitates the removal of the phosphorus. This basic Bessemer process, or <i>Thomas
Gilchrist process</i>, introduced about 1880, enables ores containing a considerable amount
of phosphorus, which had hitherto only been used for cast iron, to be used for making
wrought iron and steel. Naturally the greatest uniformity will be obtained by re-melting
the metal. Steel is re-melted in small wind furnaces, in masses not exceeding 30 kilos;
a liquid metal is formed, which may be cast in moulds. A mixture of wrought and cast
iron is often used for making cast steel (the addition of a small amount of metallic Al
improves the homogeneity of the castings, by facilitating the passage of the impurities
into slag). Large steel castings are made by simultaneous fusion in several furnaces and
crucibles; in this way, castings up to 80 tons or more, such as large ordnance, may be
made. This molten, and therefore homogeneous, steel is called <i>cast steel</i>. Of late years
the <i>Martin's process</i> for the manufacture of steel has come largely into use; it was
invented in France about 1860, and with the use of regenerative furnaces it enables large
quantities of cast steel to be made at a time. It is based on the melting of cast iron with
iron oxides and iron itself&mdash;for instance, pure ores, scrap, &amp;c. There the carbon of the
cast iron and the oxygen of the oxide form carbonic oxide, and the carbon therefore
burns out, and thus cast steel is obtained from cast iron, providing, naturally, that there
is a requisite proportion and corresponding degree of heat. The advantage of this
process is that not only do the carbon, silicon, and manganese, but also a great part of
the sulphur and phosphorus of the cast iron burn out at the expense of the oxygen of the
iron oxides. During the last decade the manufacture of steel and its application for
rails, armour plate, guns, boilers, &amp;c., has developed to an enormous extent, thanks to
the invention of cheap processes for the manufacture of large masses of homogeneous
cast steel. Wrought iron may also be melted, but the heat of a blast furnace is insufficient
for this. It easily melts in the oxyhydrogen flame. It may be obtained in a molten
state directly from cast iron, if the latter be melted with nitre and sufficiently stirred up.
Considerable oxidation then takes place inside the mass of cast iron, and the temperature
rises to such an extent that the wrought iron formed remains liquid. A method is also
known for obtaining wrought iron directly from rich iron ores by the action of carbonic
oxide: the wrought iron is then formed as a spongy mass (which forms an excellent
filter for purifying water), and may be worked up into wrought iron or steel either by
forging or by dissolving in molten cast iron.</p>

<p>Everybody is more or less familiar with the <i>difference in the properties of steel and
wrought iron</i>. Iron is remarkable for its softness, pliability, and small elasticity, whilst
steel may be characterised by its capability of attaining elasticity and hardness if it be
cooled suddenly after having been heated to a definite temperature, or, as it is termed,
<i>tempered</i>. But if tempered steel be re-heated and slowly cooled, it becomes as soft as
wrought iron, and can then be cut with the file and forged, and in general can be made
to assume any shape, like wrought iron. In this soft condition it is called <i>annealed steel</i>.
The transition from tempered to annealed steel thus takes place in a similar way to the
transition from white to grey cast iron. Steel, when homogeneous, has considerable
lustre, and such a fine granular structure that it takes a very high polish. Its fracture
clearly shows the granular nature of its structure. The possibility of tempering steel
enables it to be used for making all kinds of cutting instruments, because annealed steel
can be forged, turned, drawn (under rollers, for instance, for making rails, bars, &amp;c.), filed,
&amp;c., and it may then be tempered, ground and polished. The method and temperature
of tempering and annealing steel determine its hardness and other qualities. Steel is
generally tempered to the required degree of hardness in the following manner: It is
first strongly heated (for instance, up to 600°), and then plunged into water&mdash;that is,
hardened by rapid cooling (it then becomes as brittle as glass). It is then heated until
the surface assumes a definite colour, and finally cooled either quickly or slowly.
When steel is heated up to 220°, its surface acquires a yellow colour (surgical instruments);
it first of all becomes straw-coloured (razors, &amp;c.), and then gold-coloured; then
at a temperature of 250° it becomes brown (scissors), then red, then light blue at 285°
(springs), then indigo at 300° (files), and finally sea-green at about 340°. These colours
are only the tints of thin films, like the hues of soap bubbles, and appear on the steel
because a thin layer of oxides is formed over its surface. Steel rusts more slowly than
wrought iron, and is more soluble in acids than cast iron, but less so than wrought iron.
Its specific gravity is about 7·6 to 7·9.</p>

<p>As regards the formation of steel, it was a long time before the process of cementation
was thoroughly understood, because in this case infusible charcoal permeates unfused
wrought iron. Caron showed that this permeation depends on the fact that the charcoal
used in the process contains alkalis, which, in the presence of the nitrogen of the
air, form metallic cyanides; these being volatile and fusible, permeate the iron, and,
giving up their carbon to it, serve as the material for the formation of steel. This
explanation is confirmed by the fact that charcoal without alkalis or without nitrogen
will not cement iron. The charcoal used for cementation acts badly when used over
again, as it has lost alkali. The very volatile ammonium cyanide easily conduces to the
formation of steel. Although steel is also formed by the action of cyanogen compounds,
nevertheless it does not contain more nitrogen than cast or wrought iron (0·01 p.c.), and
these latter contain it because their ores contain titanium, which combines directly with
nitrogen. Hence the part played by nitrogen in steel is but an insignificant one. It
may be useful here to add some information taken from Caron's treatise concerning the
influence of foreign matter on the quality of steel. The principal properties of steel are
those of tempering and annealing. The compounds of iron with silicon and boron have
not these properties. They are more stable than the carbon compound, and this latter
is capable of changing its properties; because the carbon in it either enters into
combination or else is disengaged, which determines the condition of hardness or softness
of steel, as in white and grey cast iron. When slowly cooled, steel splits up into a
mixture of soft and carburetted iron; but, nevertheless, the carbon does not separate
from the iron. If such steel be again heated, it forms a uniform compound, and hardens
when rapidly cooled. If the same steel as before be taken and heated a long time, then,
after being slowly cooled, it becomes much more soluble in acid, and leaves a residue of
pure carbon. This shows that the combination between the carbon and iron in steel
becomes destroyed when subjected to heat, and the steel becomes iron mixed with
carbon. Such <i>burnt</i> steel cannot be tempered, but may be corrected by continued
forging in a heated condition, which has the effect of redistributing the carbon equally
throughout the whole mass. After the forging, if the iron is pure and the carbon has
not been burnt out, steel is again formed, which may be tempered. If steel be repeatedly
or strongly heated, it becomes burnt through and cannot be tempered or
annealed; the carbon separates from the iron, and this is effected more easily if the
steel contains other impurities which are capable of forming stable combinations with
iron, such as silicon, sulphur, or phosphorus. If there be much silicon, it occupies the
place of the carbon, and then continued forging will not induce the carbon once
separated to re-enter into combination. Such steel is easily burnt through and cannot
be corrected; when burnt through, it is hard and cannot be annealed&mdash;this is tough
steel, an inferior kind. Iron which contains sulphur and phosphorus cements badly,
combines but little with carbon, and steel of this kind is brittle, both hot and cold.
Iron in combination with the above-mentioned substances cannot be annealed by slow
cooling, showing that these compounds are more stable than those of carbon and iron,
and therefore they prevent the formation of the latter. Such metals as tin and zinc
combine with iron, but not with carbon, and form a brittle mass which cannot be
annealed and is deleterious to steel. Manganese and tungsten, on the contrary, are
capable of combining with charcoal; they do not hinder the formation of steel, but even
remove the injurious effects of other admixtures (by transforming these admixed substances
into new compounds and slags), and are therefore ranked with the substances
which act beneficially on steel; but, nevertheless, the best steel, which is capable of
renewing most often its primitive qualities after burning or hot forging, is the purest.
The addition of Ni, Cr, W, and certain other metals to steel renders it very suitable for
certain special purposes, and is therefore frequently made use of.</p>

<p>It is worthy of attention that steel, besides temper, possesses many variable
properties, a review of which may be made in the classification of the <i>sorts of steel</i>
(1878, Cockerell). (1) <i>Very mild steel</i> contains from 0·05 to 0·20 p.c. of carbon, breaks
with a weight of 40 to 50 kilos per square millimetre, and has an extension of 20 to
30 p.c.; it may be welded, like wrought iron, but cannot be tempered; is used in sheets
for boilers, armour plate and bridges, nails, rivets, &amp;c., as a substitute for wrought iron;
(2) <i>mild steel</i>, from 0·20 to 0·35 p.c. of carbon, resistance to tension 50 to 60 kilos,
extension 15 to 20 p.c., not easily welded, and tempers badly, used for axles, rails, and
railway tyres, for cannons and guns, and for parts of machines destined to resist bending

<p>The properties of ordinary <i>wrought iron</i> are well known. The best iron is the most
tenacious&mdash;that is to say, that which does not break up when struck with the hammer
or bent, and yet at the same time is sufficiently hard. There is, however, a distinction
between hard and soft iron. Generally the softest iron is the most tenacious, and can
best be welded, drawn into wire, sheets, &amp;c. Hard, especially tough, iron is often
characterised by its breaking when bent, and is therefore very difficult to work, and
objects made from it are less serviceable in many respects. Soft iron is most adapted
for making wire and sheet iron and such small objects as nails. Soft iron is characterised
by its attaining a fibrous fracture after forging, whilst tough iron preserves its granular
structure after this operation. Certain sorts of iron, although fairly soft at the ordinary
temperature, become brittle when heated and are difficult to weld. These sorts are
less suitable for being worked up into small objects. The variety of the properties of
iron depends on the impurities which it contains. In general, the iron used in the arts
still contains carbon and always a certain quantity of silicon, manganese, sulphur,
phosphorus, &amp;c. A variety in the proportion of these component parts changes the
quality of the iron. In addition to this the change which soft wrought iron, having a
fibrous structure, undergoes when subjected to repeated blows and vibrations is considerable;
it then becomes granular and brittle. This to a certain degree explains the
want of stability of some iron objects&mdash;such as truck axles, which must be renewed after
a certain term of service, otherwise they become brittle. It is evident that there are
innumerable intermediate transitions from wrought iron to steel and cast iron.</p>

<p>At the present day the greater part of the cast iron manufactured is converted into
steel, generally cast steel (Bessemer's and Martin's). I may add the Urals, Donetz
district, and other parts of Russia offer the greatest advantages for the development of
an iron industry, because these localities not only contain vast supplies of excellent iron
ore, but also coal, which is necessary for smelting it.</p></div>

Steel Works, 140 volumes of liquid molten steel give 128 volumes of solid metal. By
means of a galvanic current of great intensity and dense charcoal as one electrode, and
iron as the other, Bernadoss welded iron and fused holes through sheet iron. Soft
wrought iron, like steel and soft malleable cast iron, may be melted in Siemens'
regenerative furnaces, and in furnaces heated with naphtha.</p></div>

temperature approaching 600°&mdash;that is, between dark and bright red heat&mdash;all kinds of
wrought iron undergo a peculiar change called <i>recalescence</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a spontaneous rise of
temperature. If iron be considerably heated and allowed to cool, it may be observed
that at this temperature the cooling stops&mdash;that is, latent heat is disengaged, corresponding
with a change in condition. The specific heat, electrical conductivity, magnetic,
and other properties then also change. In tempering, the temperature of recalescence
must not be reached, and so also in annealing, &amp;c. It is evident that a change of the
internal condition is here encountered, exactly similar to the transition from a solid to a
liquid, although there is no evident physical change. It is probable that attentive study
would lead to the discovery of a similar change in other substances.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_415" id="Footnote_12_415"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_415"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The particles of steel are linked together or connected more closely than those of
the other metals; this is shown by the fact that it only breaks with a tensile strain of
50&ndash;80 kilos per sq. mm., whilst wrought iron only withstands about 30 kilos, cast iron
10, copper 35, silver 23, platinum 30, wood 8. The elasticity of iron, steel, and other
metals is expressed by the so-called <i>coefficient of elasticity</i>. Let a rod be taken whose
length is L; if a weight, P, be hung from the extremity of it, it will lengthen to <i>l</i>.
The less it lengthens under other equal conditions, the more elastic the material, if it
resumes its original length when the weight is removed. It has been shown by experiment
that the increase in length <i>l</i>, due to elasticity, is directly proportional to the length L
and the weight P, and inversely proportional to the section, but changes with the
material. The coefficient of elasticity expresses that weight (in kilos per sq. mm.)
under which a rod having a square section taken as 1 (we take 1 sq. mm.) acquires
double the length by tension. Naturally in practice materials do not withstand such a
lengthening, under a certain weight they attain a limit of elasticity, <i>i.e.</i> they stretch
permanently (undergo deformation). Neglecting fractions (as the elasticity of metals
varies not only with the temperature, but also with forging, purity, &amp;c.), the coefficient
of elasticity of steel and iron is 20,000, copper and brass 10,000, silver 7,000, glass 6,000,
lead 2,000, and wood 1,200.</p></div>

found this by experiments about 1860, and immediately published the fact. This method
is now very generally applied.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_417" id="Footnote_14_417"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_417"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> See Chapter XVIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_34_BIS_163">34 bis</a>. Based on the rapid oxidation of iron and its
increase in volume in the presence of water and salts of ammonium, a packing is used
for water mains and steam pipes which is tightly hammered into the socket joints.
This packing consists of a mixture of iron filings and a small quantity of sal-ammoniac
(and sulphur) moistened with water; after a certain lapse of time, especially after the
pipes have been used, this mass swells to such an extent that it hermetically seals the
joints of the pipes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_418" id="Footnote_15_418"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_418"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Here, however, a ferric salt may also be formed (when all the iron has dissolved
and the cupric salt is still in excess), because the cupric salts are reduced by ferrous
salts. Cast iron is also dissolved.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_419" id="Footnote_16_419"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_419"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Powdery reduced iron is passive with regard to nitric acid of a specific gravity of
1·37, but when heated the acid acts on it. This passiveness disappears in the magnetic
field. Saint-Edme attributes the passiveness of iron (and nickel) to the formation of
nitride of iron on the surface of the metal, because he observed that when heated in dry
hydrogen ammonia is evolved by passive iron.</p>

<p>Remsen observed that if a strip of iron be immersed in acid and placed in the magnetic
field, it is principally dissolved at its middle part&mdash;that is, the acid acts more feebly
at the poles. According to Étard (1891) strong nitric acid dissolves iron in making it
passive, although the action is a very slow one.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_420" id="Footnote_17_420"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_420"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> <i>Iron vitriol</i> or <i>green vitriol</i>, sulphate of iron or ferrous sulphate, generally crystallises
from solutions, like magnesium sulphate, with seven molecules of water,
FeSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O. This salt is not only formed by the action of iron on sulphuric acid, but
also by the action of moisture and air on iron pyrites, especially when previously roasted
(FeS<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> = FeS + SO<sub>2</sub>), and in this condition it easily absorbs the oxygen of damp air
(FeS + O<sub>4</sub> = FeSO<sub>4</sub>). Green vitriol is obtained in many processes as a by-product.
Ferrous sulphate, like all the ferrous salts, has a pale greenish colour hardly perceptible
in solution. If it be desired to preserve it without change&mdash;that is, so as not to contain
ferric compounds&mdash;it is necessary to keep it hermetically sealed. This is best done by
expelling the air by means of sulphurous anhydride or ether; sulphurous anhydride,
SO<sub>2</sub>, removes oxygen from ferric compounds, which might be formed, and is itself
changed into sulphuric acid, and hence the oxidation of the ferrous compound does not
take place in its presence. Unless these precautions are taken, green vitriol turns
brown, partly changing into the ferric salt. When turned brown, it is not completely
soluble in water, because during its oxidation a certain amount of free insoluble ferric
oxide is formed: 6FeSO<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> = 2Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. In order to cleanse such mixed
green vitriol from the oxide, it is necessary to add some sulphuric acid and iron and boil
the mixture; the ferric salt is then transformed into the ferrous state: Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + Fe
= 3FeSO<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>Green vitriol is used for the manufacture of Nordhausen sulphuric acid (Chapter
<a href="#Page_200">XX.</a>), for preparing ferric oxide, in many dye works (for preparing the indigo vats and
reducing blue indigo to white), and in many other processes; it is also a very good
disinfectant, and is the cheapest salt from which other compounds of iron may be
obtained.</p>

<p>The other ferrous salts (excepting the yellow prussiate, which will be mentioned later)
are but little used, and it is therefore unnecessary to dwell upon them. We will only
mention <i>ferrous chloride</i>, which, in the crystalline state, has the composition
FeCl<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O. It is easily prepared; for instance, by the action of hydrochloric acid on
iron, and in the anhydrous state by the action of hydrochloric acid gas on metallic iron
at a red heat. The anhydrous ferrous chloride then volatilises in the form of colourless
cubic crystals. Ferrous oxalate (or the double potassium salt) acts as a powerful
reducing agent, and is frequently employed in photography (as a developer).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_421" id="Footnote_18_421"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_421"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Ferrous sulphate, like magnesium sulphate, easily forms double salts&mdash;for instance,
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,FeSO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O. This salt does not oxidise in air so readily as green vitriol, and
is therefore used for standardising KMnO<sub>4</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_422" id="Footnote_19_422"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_422"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The transformation of ferrous oxide into ferric oxide is not completely effected in
air, as then only a part of the suboxide is converted into ferric oxide. Under these
circumstances the so-called magnetic oxide of iron is generally produced, which contains
atomic quantities of the suboxide and oxide&mdash;namely, FeO,Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This substance,
as already mentioned, is found in nature and in iron scale. It is also formed
when most ferrous and ferric salts are heated in air; thus, for instance, when ferrous
carbonate, FeCO<sub>3</sub> (native or the precipitate given by soda in a solution of FeX<sub>2</sub>), is
heated it loses the elements of carbonic anhydride, and magnetic oxide remains. This
oxide of iron is attracted by the magnet, and is on this account called magnetic oxide,
although it does not always show magnetic properties. If magnetic oxide be dissolved in
any acid&mdash;for instance, hydrochloric&mdash;which does not act as an oxidising agent, a ferrous
salt is first formed and ferric oxide remains, which is also capable of passing into
solution. The best way of preparing the hydrate of the magnetic oxide is by decomposing
a mixture of ferrous and ferric salts with ammonia; it is, however, indispensable to pour
this mixture into the ammonia, and not <i>vice versâ</i>, as in that case the ferrous oxide would
at first be precipitated alone, and then the ferric oxide. The compound thus formed has a
bright green colour, and when dried forms a black powder. Other combinations of
ferrous with ferric oxide are known, as are also compounds of ferric oxide with other
bases. Thus, for instance, compounds are known containing 4 molecules of ferrous oxide
to 1 of ferric oxide, and also 6 of ferrous to 1 of ferric oxide. These are also magnetic,
and are formed by heating iron in air. The magnesium compound MgO,Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is
prepared by passing gaseous hydrochloric acid over a heated mixture of magnesia and
ferric oxide. Crystalline magnesium oxide is then formed, and black, shiny, octahedral
crystals of the above-mentioned composition. This compound is analogous to the
aluminates&mdash;for instance, to spinel. Bernheim (1888) and Rousseau (1891) obtained
many similar compounds of ferric oxide, and their composition apparently corresponds
to the hydrates (Note <a href="#Footnote_22_425">22</a>) known for the oxide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_423" id="Footnote_20_423"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_423"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Copper and cuprous salts also reduce ferric oxide to ferrous oxide, and are themselves
turned into cupric salts. The essence of the reactions is expressed by the following
equations: Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + Cu<sub>2</sub>O = 2FeO + 2CuO; Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + Cu = 2FeO + CuO. This fact is made
use of in analysing copper compounds, the quantity of copper being ascertained by the
amount of ferrous salt obtained. An excess of ferric salt is required to complete the
reaction. Here we have an example of reverse reaction; the ferrous oxide or its salt in
the presence of alkali transforms the cupric oxide into cuprous oxide and metallic copper,
as observed by Lovel, Knopp, and others.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_424" id="Footnote_21_424"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_424"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> We will here mention the reactions by means of which it may be ascertained
whether the ferrous compound has been entirely converted into a ferric compound or
<i>vice versâ</i>. There are two substances which are best employed for this purpose:
potassium ferricyanide, FeK<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, and potassium thiocyanate, KCNS. The first salt
gives with ferrous salts a blue precipitate of an insoluble salt, having a composition
Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>12</sub>N<sub>12</sub>; but with ferric salts it does not form any precipitate, and only gives a brown
colour, and therefore when transforming a ferrous salt into a ferric salt, the completion
of the transformation may be detected by taking a drop of the liquid on paper or on a
porcelain plate and adding a drop of the ferricyanide solution. If a blue precipitate be
formed, then part of the ferrous salt still remains; if there is none, the transformation is
complete. The thiocyanate does not give any marked coloration with ferrous salts; but
with ferric salts in the most diluted state it forms a bright red soluble compound, and
therefore when transforming a ferric salt into a ferrous salt we must proceed as before,
testing a drop of the solution with thiocyanate, when the absence of a red colour will
prove the total transformation of the ferric salt into the ferrous state, and if a red colour
is apparent it shows that the transformation is not yet complete.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_425" id="Footnote_22_425"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_425"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The two ferric hydroxides are not only characterised by the above-mentioned
properties, but also by the fact that the first hydroxide forms immediately with potassium
ferrocyanide, K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, a blue colour depending on the formation of Prussian blue,
whilst the second hydroxide does not give any reaction whatever with this salt. The
first hydroxide is entirely soluble in nitric, hydrochloric, and all other acids; whilst the
second sometimes (not always) forms a brick-coloured liquid, which appears turbid
and does not give the reactions peculiar to the ferric salts (Péan de Saint-Gilles,
Scheurer-Kestner). In addition to this, when the smallest quantity of an alkaline salt
is added to this liquid, ferric oxide is precipitated. Thus a colloidal solution is formed
(hydrosol), which is exactly similar to silica hydrosol (Chapter <a href="#Page_60">XVII.</a>), according to
which example the hydrosol of ferric oxide may be obtained.</p>

<p>If ordinary ferric hydroxide be dissolved in acetic acid, a solution of the colour of red
wine is obtained, which has all the reactions characteristic of ferric salts. But if this
solution (formed in the cold) be heated to the boiling-point, its colour is very rapidly
intensified, a smell of acetic acid becomes apparent, and the solution then contains a
new variety of ferric oxide. If the boiling of the solution be continued, acetic acid is
evolved, and the modified ferric oxide is precipitated. If the evaporation of the acetic
acid be prevented (in a closed or sealed vessel), and the liquid be heated for some time,
the whole of the ferric hydroxide then passes into the insoluble form, and if some alkaline
salt be added (to the hydrosol formed), the whole of the ferric oxide is then precipitated
in its insoluble form. This method may be applied for separating ferric oxide from
solutions of its salts.</p>

<p>All phenomena observed respecting ferric oxide (colloidal properties, various forms,
formation of double basic salts) demonstrate that this substance, like silica, alumina,
lead hydroxide, &amp;c., is polymerised, that the composition is represented by (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_426" id="Footnote_23_426"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_426"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The ferric compound which is most used in practice (for instance, in medicine, for
cauterising, stopping bleeding, &amp;c.&mdash;Oleum Martis) is <i>ferric chloride</i>, Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, easily
obtained by dissolving the ordinary hydrated oxide of iron in hydrochloric acid. It is
obtained in the anhydrous state by the action of chlorine on heated iron. The experiment
is carried on in a porcelain tube, and a solid <i>volatile substance</i> is then formed in
the shape of brilliant violet scales which very readily absorb moisture from the air, and
when heated with water decompose into crystalline ferric oxide and hydrochloric acid:
Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 6HCl + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Ferric chloride is so volatile that the density of its
vapour may be determined. At 440° it is equal to 164·0 referred to hydrogen; the
formula Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> corresponds with a density of 162·5. An aqueous solution of this salt
has a brown colour. On evaporating and cooling this solution, crystals separate containing
6 or 12 molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O. Ferric chloride is not only soluble in water, but also
in alcohol (similarly to magnesium chloride, &amp;c.) and in ether. If the latter solutions
are exposed to the rays of the sun they become colourless, and deposit ferrous chloride,
FeCl<sub>2</sub>, chlorine being disengaged. After a certain lapse of time, the aqueous solutions
of ferric chloride decompose with precipitation of a basic salt, thus demonstrating the
instability of ferric chloride, like the other salts of ferric oxide (Note <a href="#Footnote_22_425">22</a>). This salt is
much more stable in the form of double salts, like all the ferric salts and also the
salts of many other feeble bases. Potassium or ammonium chloride forms with it very
beautiful red crystals of a double salt, having the composition Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,4KCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O.
When a solution of this salt is evaporated it decomposes, with separation of potassium
chloride.</p>

<p>B. Roozeboom (1892) studied in detail (as for CaCl<sub>2</sub>, Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_50_879">50</a>) the
separation of different hydrates from saturated solutions of Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> at various concentrations
and temperatures; he found that there are 4 crystallohydrates with 12, 7, 5, and
4 molecules of water. An orange yellow only slightly hygroscopic hydrate, Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O,
is most easily and usually obtained, which melts at 37°; its solubility at different temperatures
is represented by the curve BCD in the accompanying figure, where the point B
corresponds to the formation, at -55°, of a cryohydrate containing about Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 36H<sub>2</sub>O,
the point C corresponds to the melting-point (+37°) of the hydrate Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, and
the curve CD to the fall in the temperature of crystallisation with an increase in the
amount of salt, or decrease in the amount of water (in the figure the temperatures are
taken along the axis of abscissæ, and the amount of <i>n</i> in the formula <i>n</i>Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> + 100H<sub>2</sub>O
along the axis of ordinates). When anhydrous Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> is added to the above hydrate
(12H<sub>2</sub>O), or some of the water is evaporated from the latter, very hygroscopic
crystals of Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O (Fritsche) are formed; they melt at 56°, their solubility is
expressed by the curve HJ, which also presents a small branch at the end J. This
again gives the fall in the temperature of crystallisation with an increase in the amount
of Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>. Besides these curves and the solubility of the anhydrous salt expressed by
the line KL (up to 100°, beyond which chlorine is liberated), Roozeboom also gives the
two curves, EFG and JK, corresponding to the crystallohydrates, Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O (melts at
+32°·5, that is lower than any of the others) and Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O (melts at 73°·5), which
he discovered by a systematic research on the solutions of ferric chloride. The curve
AB represents the separation of ice from dilute solutions of the salt.</p>

<p>The researches of the same Dutch chemist upon the conditions of the formation of
crystals from the double salt (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl)<sub>4</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O are even more perfect. This salt
was obtained in 1839 by Fritsche, and is easily formed from a strong solution of Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>
by adding sal-ammoniac, when it separates in crimson rhombic crystals, which, after
dissolving in water, only deposit again on evaporation, together with the sal-ammoniac.</p>

<p>Roozeboom (1892) found that when the solution contains <i>b</i> molecules of Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, and
<i>a</i> molecules of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, per 100 molecules H<sub>2</sub>O, then at 15° one of the following separations
takes place: (1) crystals, Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, when <i>a</i> varies between 0 and 11, and <i>b</i>
between 4·65 and 4·8, or (2) a mixture of these crystals and the double salt, when <i>a</i>
= 1·36, and <i>b</i> = 4·47, or (3) the double salt, Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,4NH<sub>4</sub>Cl,2H<sub>2</sub>O, when <i>a</i> varies
between 2 and 11·8, and <i>b</i> between 3·1 and 4·56, or (4) a mixture of sal-ammoniac with
the iron salt (it crystallises in separate cubes, Retgers, Lehmann), when <i>a</i> varies
between 7·7 and 10·9, and <i>b</i> is less than 3·38, or (5) sal-ammoniac, when <i>a</i> = 11·88. And
as in the double salt, <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> :: 4 : 1 it is evident that the double salt only separates out
when the ratio <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> is less than 4 : 1 (<i>i.e.</i> when Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> predominates). The above is
seen more clearly in the accompanying
figure, where <i>a</i>, or the
number of molecules of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl
per 100H<sub>2</sub>O, is taken along the
axis of abscissæ, and <i>b</i>, or the
number of molecules of Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,
along the ordinates. The curves
ABCD correspond to saturation
and present an iso-therm of 15°.
The portion AB corresponds to
the separation of chloride of iron
(the ascending nature of this
curve shows that the solubility of
Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> is increased by the presence
of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, while that of
NH<sub>4</sub>Cl decreases in the presence
of Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>), the portion BC to the
double salt, and the portion CD
to a mixture of sal-ammoniac and
ferric chloride, while the straight
line OF corresponds to the ratio Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,4NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, or <i>a</i> : <i>b</i> :: 4 : 1. The portion CE shows
that more double salt may be introduced into the solution without decomposition, but
then the solution deposits a mixture of sal-ammoniac and ferric chloride (<i>see</i> Chapter
XXIV. Note <a href="#Footnote_9_BIS_484">9</a><sup>bis</sup>). If there were more such well-investigated cases of solutions, our
knowledge of double salts, solutions, the influence of water, equilibria, isomorphous
mixtures, and such-like provinces of chemical relations might be considerably advanced.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_427" id="Footnote_24_427"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_427"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The normal ferric salts are decomposed by heat and even by water, forming basic
salts, which may be prepared in various ways. Generally ferric hydroxide is dissolved
in solutions of ferric nitrate; if it contains a double quantity of iron the basic salt is
formed which contains Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (in the form of hydroxide) + 2Fe<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> = 3Fe<sub>2</sub>O(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>,
a salt of the type Fe<sub>2</sub>OX<sub>4</sub>. Probably water enters into its composition. With considerable
quantities of ferric oxide, insoluble basic salts are obtained containing various
amounts of ferric hydroxide. Thus when a solution of the above-mentioned basic acid
is boiled, a precipitate is formed containing 4(Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>8</sub>,2(N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>),3H<sub>2</sub>O, which probably
contains 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. If a solution of basic nitrate be sealed in a
tube and then immersed in boiling water, the colour of the solution changes just in
the same way as if a solution of ferric acetate had been employed (Note <a href="#Footnote_22_425">22</a>). The
solution obtained smells strongly of nitric acid, and on adding a drop of sulphuric or
hydrochloric acid the insoluble variety of hydrated ferric oxide is precipitated.</p>

<p>Normal ferric <i>orthophosphate</i> is soluble in sulphuric, hydrochloric, and nitric acids,
but insoluble in others, such as, for instance, acetic acid. The composition of this salt
in the anhydrous state is FePO<sub>4</sub>, because in orthophosphoric acid there are three atoms
of hydrogen, and iron, in the ferric state, replaces the three atoms of hydrogen. This
salt is obtained from ferric acetate, which, with disodium phosphate, forms a <i>white precipitate</i>
of FePO<sub>4</sub>, containing water. If a solution of ferric chloride (yellowish-red
colour) be mixed with a solution of sodium acetate in excess, the liquid assumes an
intense brown colour which demonstrates the formation of a certain quantity of ferric
acetate; then the disodium phosphate directly forms a white gelatinous precipitate of ferric
phosphate. By this means the whole of the iron may be precipitated, and the liquid which
was brown then becomes colourless. If this normal salt be dissolved in orthophosphoric
acid, the crystalline acid salt FeH<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is formed. If there be an excess of ferric oxide
in the solution, the precipitate will consist of the basic salt. If ferric phosphate be
dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and ammonia be added, a salt is precipitated on heating
which, after continued washing in water and heating (to remove the water), has the
composition Fe<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>11</sub>&mdash;that is, 2Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. In an aqueous condition this salt may be
considered as ferric hydroxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>, in which (OH)<sub>3</sub> is replaced by the equivalent
group PO<sub>4</sub>. Whenever ammonia is added to a solution containing an excess of ferric
salt and a certain amount of phosphoric acid, a precipitate is formed containing the
whole of the phosphoric acid in the mass of the ferric oxide.</p>

<p>Ferric oxide is characterised as a feeble base, and also by the fact of its forming double
salts&mdash;for instance, <i>potassium iron alum</i>, which has a composition Fe<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,24H<sub>2</sub>O
or FeK(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O. It is obtained in the form of almost colourless or light
rose-coloured large octahedra of the regular system by simply mixing solutions of
potassium sulphate and the ferric sulphate obtained by dissolving ferric oxide in sulphuric
acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_428" id="Footnote_25_428"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_428"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> It would seem that all normal ferric salts are colourless, and that the brown colour
which is peculiar to the solutions is really due to basic ferric salts. A remarkable
example of the apparent change of colour of salts is represented by the ferrous and ferric
oxalates. The former in a dry state has a yellow colour, although as a rule the ferrous
salts are green, and the latter is colourless or pale green. When the normal ferric salt is
dissolved in water it is, like many salts, probably decomposed by the water into acid
and basic salts, and the latter communicates a brown colour to the solution. Iron alum
is almost colourless, is easily decomposed by water, and is the best proof of our assertion.
The study of the phenomena peculiar to ferric nitrate might, in my opinion, give
a very useful addition to our knowledge of the aqueous solutions of salts in general.</p></div>

somewhat greater. Similar results were also obtained by increasing the mass of FeX<sub>3</sub>

hydrated ferric oxide is suspended, the turbid liquid acquires a dark pomegranate-red

The chlorine must not be in excess, otherwise the salt is again decomposed, although the
mode of decomposition is unknown; however, ferric chloride and potassium chlorate
are probably formed. Another way in which the above-described salt is formed is also
remarkable; a galvanic current (from 6 Grove elements) is passed through cast-iron
and platinum electrodes into a strong solution of potassium hydroxide. The cast-iron
electrode is connected with the positive pole, and the platinum electrode is surrounded
by a porous earthenware cylinder. Oxygen would be evolved at the cast-iron
electrode, but it is used up in oxidation, and a dark solution of potassium ferrate is
therefore formed about it. It is remarkable that the cast iron cannot be replaced by
wrought iron.</p></div>

Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> (described later, Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII.</a>), it was shown subsequently by Mond and
Quincke (1891), and also by Berthelot, that iron, under certain conditions, in a stream of
carbonic oxide, also volatilises and forms a compound like that given by nickel. Roscoe
and Scudder then showed that when water gas is passed through and kept under
pressure (8 atmospheres) in iron vessels a portion of the iron volatilises from the
sides of the vessel, and that when the gas is burnt it deposits a certain amount of oxides
of iron (the same result is obtained with ordinary coal gas which contains a small amount
of CO). To obtain the <i>volatile compound of iron with carbonic oxide</i>, Mond prepared
a finely divided iron by heating the oxalate in a stream of hydrogen, and after cooling it
to 80°-45° he passed CO over the powder. The iron then formed (although very slowly)
a volatile compound containing Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub> (as though it answered to a very high type,
FeX<sub>10</sub>), which when cooled condenses into a liquid (slightly coloured, probably owing to
incipient decomposition), sp. gr. 1·47, which solidifies at -21°, boils at about 103°, and
has a vapour density (about 6·5 with respect to air) corresponding to the above formula;
it decomposes at 180°. Water and dilute acids do not act upon it, but it decomposes
under the action of light and forms a hard, non-volatile crystalline yellow compound
Fe<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>7</sub> which decomposes at 80° and again forms Fe(CO)<sub>5</sub>.</p></div>

solution of potassium hydroxide, and from the ferricyanide by the action of alkalis and
reducing substances (because the red prussiate is a product of oxidation produced by
the action of chlorine: a ferric salt is reduced to a ferrous salt), &amp;c. In many works
(especially in Germany and France) yellow prussiate is prepared from the mass, containing
oxide of iron, and employed for purifying coal gas (Vol. I., p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_361">361</a>), which
generally contains cyanogen compounds. About 2 p.c. of the nitrogen contained in coal is
converted into cyanogen, which forms Prussian blue and thiocyanates in the mass used
for purifying the gas. On evaporation the solution yields large yellow crystals containing
3 molecules of water, which is easily expelled by heating above 100°. 100 parts of water
at the ordinary temperature are capable of dissolving 25 parts of this salt; its sp. gr. is
1·83. When ignited it forms potassium cyanide and iron carbide, FeC<sub>2</sub> (Chapter XIII.,
Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_12_789">12</a>). Oxidising substances change it into potassium ferricyanide. With strong
sulphuric acid it gives carbonic oxide, and with dilute sulphuric acid, when heated,
prussic acid is evolved according to the equation: 2K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = K<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_436" id="Footnote_29_436"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_436"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Skraup obtained this salt both from potassium ferrocyanide with ferric chloride
and from ferricyanide with ferrous chloride, which evidently shows that it contains iron
in both the ferric and ferrous states. With ferrous chloride it forms Prussian blue, and
with ferric chloride Turnbull's blue.</p>

<p>Prussian blue was discovered in the beginning of the last century by a Berlin
manufacturer, Diesbach. It was then prepared, as it sometimes is also at present,
directly from potassium cyanide obtained by heating animal charcoal with potassium
carbonate. The mass thus obtained is dissolved in water, alum is added to the
solution in order to saturate the free alkali, and then a solution of green vitriol is added
which has previously been sufficiently exposed to the air to contain both ferric and
ferrous salts. If the solution of potassium cyanide be mixed with a solution containing
both salts, Prussian blue will be formed, because it is a compound of ferrous cyanide,
FeC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, and ferric cyanide, Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>. A ferric salt with potassium ferrocyanide forms
a blue colour, because ferrous cyanide is obtained from the first salt and ferric cyanide
from the second. During the preparation of this compound alkali must be avoided, as
otherwise the precipitate would contain oxides of iron. Prussian blue has not a crystalline
structure; it forms a blue mass with a copper-red metallic lustre. Both acids and
alkalis act on it. The action is at first confined to the ferric salt it contains. Thus
alkalis form ferric oxide and ferrocyanide in solution: 2Fe<sub>2</sub>C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>,3FeC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> + 12KHO
= 2(Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O) + 3K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>. Various ferrocyanides may thus be prepared. Prussian
blue is soluble in an aqueous solution of oxalic acid, forming blue ink. In air, when
exposed to the action of light, it fades; but in the dark again absorbs oxygen and
becomes blue, which fact is also sometimes noticed in blue cloth. An excess of potassium
ferrocyanide renders Prussian blue soluble in water, although insoluble in various saline
solutions&mdash;that is, it converts it into the soluble variety. Strong hydrochloric acid also
dissolves Prussian blue.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_437" id="Footnote_30_437"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_437"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> An excess of chlorine must not be employed in preparing this compound, otherwise
the reaction goes further. It is easy to find out when the action of the chlorine on potassium
ferrocyanide must cease; it is only necessary to take a sample of the liquid and add a
solution of a ferric salt to it. If a precipitate of Prussian blue is formed, more chlorine
must be added, as there is still some undecomposed ferrocyanide, for the ferricyanide
does not give a precipitate with ferric salts. Potassium ferricyanide, like the ferrocyanide,
easily exchanges its potassium for hydrogen and various metals by double
decomposition. With the salts of tin, silver, and mercury it forms yellow precipitates,
and with those of uranium, nickel, cobalt, copper, and bismuth brown precipitates. The
lead salt under the action of sulphuretted hydrogen forms lead sulphide and a hydrogen
salt or acid, H<sub>3</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, corresponding with potassium ferricyanide, which is soluble,
crystallises in red needles, and resembles hydroferrocyanic acid, H<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>. Under the
action of reducing agents&mdash;for instance, sulphuretted hydrogen, copper&mdash;potassium ferricyanide
is changed into ferrocyanide, especially in the presence of alkalis, and thus forms
a rather energetic <i>oxidising agent</i>&mdash;capable, for instance, of changing manganous oxide
into dioxide, bleaching tissues, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_438" id="Footnote_31_438"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_438"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> It is important to mention a series of readily crystallisable salts formed by the
action of nitric acid on potassium and other ferrocyanides and ferricyanides. These
salt contain the elements of nitric oxide, and are therefore called <i>nitro-(nitroso)
ferricyanides</i> (<i>nitroprussides</i>). Generally a crystalline sodium salt is obtained,
Na<sub>2</sub>FeC<sub>5</sub>N<sub>6</sub>O,2H<sub>2</sub>O. In its composition this salt differs from the red sodium salt,
Na<sub>3</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, by the fact that in it one molecule of sodium cyanide, NaCN, is replaced by
nitric oxide, NO. In order to prepare it, potassium ferrocyanide in powder is mixed
with five-sevenths of its weight of nitric acid diluted with an equal volume of water.
The mixture is at first left at the ordinary temperature, and then heated on a
water-bath. Here ferricyanide is first of all formed (as shown by the liquid giving a
precipitate with ferrous chloride), which then disappears (no precipitate with ferrous
chloride), and forms a green precipitate. The liquid, when cooled, deposits crystals
of nitre. The liquid is then strained off and mixed with sodium carbonate, boiled,
filtered, and evaporated; sodium nitrate and the salt described are deposited in crystals.
It separates in prisms of a red colour. Alkalis and salts of the alkaline earths do not
give precipitates: they are soluble, but the salts of iron, zinc, copper, and silver form
precipitates where sodium is exchanged with these metals. It is remarkable that the
sulphides of the alkali metals give with this salt an intense bright purple coloration.
This series of compounds was discovered by Gmelin and studied by Playfair and others
(1849).</p>

<p>This series to a certain extent resembles the nitro-sulphide series described by
Roussin. Here the primary compound consists of black crystals, which are obtained as
follows:&mdash;Solutions of potassium hydrosulphide and nitrate are mixed, and the mixture
is agitated whilst ferric chloride is added, then boiled and filtered; on cooling, <i>black
crystals</i> are deposited, having the composition Fe<sub>6</sub>S<sub>3</sub>(NO)<sub>10</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O (Rosenberg), or, according
to Demel, FeNO<sub>2</sub>,NH<sub>2</sub>S. They have a slightly metallic lustre, and are soluble in
water, alcohol, and ether. They absorb the latter as easily as calcium chloride absorbs
water. In the presence of alkalis these crystals remain unchanged, but with acids they
evolve nitric oxides. There are several compounds which are capable of interchanging,
and correspond with Roussin's salt. Here we enter into the series of the nitrogen
compounds which have been as yet but little investigated, and will most probably in
time form most instructive material for studying the nature of that element. These
series of compounds are as unlike the usual saline compounds of inorganic chemistry as
are organic hydrocarbons. There is no necessity to describe these series in detail, because
their connection with other compounds is not yet clear, and they have not yet any
application.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_439" id="Footnote_32_439"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_439"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> The residue from the roasting of cobalt ores is called <i>zafflor</i>, and is often met with
in commerce. From this the purer compounds of cobalt may be prepared. The ores of
nickel are also first roasted, and the oxides dissolved in acid, nickelous salts being then
obtained.</p>

<p>The further treatment of cobalt and nickel ores is facilitated if the arsenic can be
almost entirely removed, which may be effected by roasting the ore a second time with a
small addition of nitre and sodium carbonate; the nitre combines with the arsenic,
forming an arsenious salt, which may be extracted with water. The remaining mass is
dissolved in hydrochloric acid, mixed with a small quantity of nitric acid. Copper, iron,
manganese, nickel, cobalt, &amp;c., pass into solution. By passing hydrogen sulphide
through the solution, copper, bismuth, lead, and arsenic are deposited as metallic sulphides;
but iron, cobalt, nickel, and manganese remain in solution. If an alkaline solution
of bleaching powder be then added to the remaining solution, the whole of the
manganese will first be deposited in the form of dioxide, then the cobalt as hydrated
cobaltic oxide, and finally the nickel also. It is, however, impossible to rely on this
method for effecting a complete separation, the more so since the higher oxides of the
three above-mentioned metals have all a black colour; but, after a few trials, it will be
easy to find how much bleaching powder is required to precipitate the manganese, and
the amount which will precipitate all the cobalt. The manganese may also be separated
from cobalt by precipitation from a mixture of the solutions of both metals (in the form of
the &lsquo;ous&rsquo; salts) with ammonium sulphide, and then treating the precipitate with acetic
acid or dilute hydrochloric acid, in which manganese sulphide is easily soluble and cobalt
sulphide almost insoluble. Further particulars relating to the separation of cobalt from
nickel may be found in treatises on analytical chemistry. In practice it is usual to rely on
the rough method of separation founded on the fact that nickel is more easily reduced and
more difficult to oxidise than cobalt. The New Caledonian ore is smelted with CaSO<sub>4</sub>
and CaCO<sub>3</sub> on coke, and a metallic regulus is obtained containing all the Ni, Fe, and S.
This is roasted with SiO<sub>2</sub>, which converts all the iron into slag, whilst the Ni remains
combined with the S; this residue on further roasting gives NiO, which is reduced by the
carbon to metallic Ni. The Canadian ore (a pyrites containing 11 p.c. Ni) is frequently
treated in America (after a preliminary dressing) by smelting it with Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
charcoal; the resultant fusible Na<sub>2</sub>S then dissolves the CuS and FeS<sub>2</sub>, while the NiS is
obtained in a bottom layer (Bartlett and Thomson's process) from which Ni is obtained
in the manner described above.</p>

<p>For manufacturing purposes somewhat impure cobalt compounds are frequently used,
which are converted into <i>smalt</i>. This is glass containing a certain amount of cobalt
oxide; the glass acquires a bright blue colour from this addition, so that when powdered
it may be used as a blue pigment; it is also unaltered at high temperatures, so
that it used to take the place now occupied by Prussian blue, ultramarine, &amp;c. At
present smalt is almost exclusively used for colouring glass and china. To prepare
smalt, ordinary impure cobalt ore (zaffre) is fused in a crucible with quartz and potassium
carbonate. A fused mass of cobalt glass is thus formed, containing silica, cobalt oxide,
and potassium oxide, and a metallic mass remains at the bottom of the crucible, containing
almost all the other metals, arsenic, nickel, copper, silver, &amp;c. This metallic
mass is called <i>speiss</i>, and is used as nickel ore for the extraction of nickel. Smalt usually
contains 70 p.c. of silica, 20 p.c. of potash and soda, and about 5 to 6 p.c. of cobaltous
oxide; the remainder consisting of other metallic oxides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_BIS_440" id="Footnote_32_BIS_440"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_BIS_440"><span class="label">[32 bis]</span></a> All we know respecting the relations of Co and Ni to Fe and Cu confirms the
fact that Co is more closely related to Fe and Ni to Cu; and as the atomic weight of
Fe = 56 and of Cu = 63, then according to the principles of the periodic system it would
be expected that the atomic weight of Co would be about 59&ndash;60, whilst that of Ni should
be greater than that of Co but less than that of Cu, <i>i.e.</i> about 50·5&ndash;60·5. However, as
yet the majority of the determinations of the atomic weights of Co and Ni give a
different result and show that a lower atomic weight is obtained for Ni than for Co.
Thus K. Winkler (1894) obtained (employing metals deposited electrolytically and determining
the amount of iodine which combined with them) Ni = 58·72 and Co = 59·37 (if
H = 1 and I = 126·53). In my opinion this should not be regarded as proving that the
principles of the periodic system cannot be applied in this instance, nor as a reason for
altering the position of these elements in the system (<i>i.e.</i> by placing Ni after Fe, and Co
next to Cu), because in the first place the figures given by different chemists (for instance,
Zimmermann, Krüss, and others) are somewhat divergent, and in the second place the
majority of the latest modes of determining the atomic weights of Co and Ni aim at
finding what weights of these metals react with known weights of other elements without
taking into account the faculty they have of absorbing hydrogen; since this faculty is
more developed in Ni than in Co the hydrogen (occluded in Ni) should lower the atomic
weight of Ni more than that of Co. On the whole, the question of the atomic
weights of Co and Ni cannot yet be considered as decided, notwithstanding the
numerous researches which have been made; still there can be no doubt that the atomic
weights of these two metals are very nearly equal, and greater than that of Fe, but less
than that of Cu. This question is of great interest, not only for completing our knowledge
of these metals, but also for perfecting our knowledge of the periodic system of the
elements.</p></div>

dilute acids. Only nitric acid dissolves both metals well. Nickel is harder, and fuses at
a higher temperature than silver. For castings, a small quantity of magnesium (0·001
part by weight) is added to nickel to render it more homogeneous (just as aluminium is
added to steel). Nickel forms many valuable alloys. Steel containing 3 p.c. Ni is particularly
valuable, its limit of elasticity is higher and its hardness is greater; it is used
for armour plate and other large pieces. The alloys of nickel, especially with copper and
zinc (melchior, <i>see</i> later), aluminium and silver, although used in certain cases, are now
replaced by nickel-plated or nickel-deposited goods (deposited by electricity from a
solution of the ammonium salts).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_442" id="Footnote_33_442"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_442"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The change of colour is dependent in all probability on the combination with
water, or according to others on polymeric transformation. It enables a solution of
cobalt chloride to be used as sympathetic ink. If something be written with cobalt
chloride on white paper, it will be invisible on account of the feeble colour of the solution,
and when dry nothing can be distinguished. If, however, the paper be heated before the
fire, the rose-coloured salt will be changed into a less hydrous blue salt, and the writing
will become quite visible, but fade away when cool.</p>

<p>The change of colour which takes place in solutions of CoCl<sub>2</sub> under the influence not
only of solution in water or alcohol, but also of a change of temperature, is a characteristic
of all the halogen salts of cobalt. Crystalline iodide of cobalt, CoI<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O, gives a
dark red solution between -22° and +20°; above +20° the solution turns brown and
passes from olive to green, from +35° to 320° the solution remains green. According to
Étard the change of colour is due to the fact that at first the solution contains the
hydrate CoI<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, and that above 35° it contains CoI<sub>2</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O. These hydrates can be
crystallised from the solutions; the former at ordinary temperature and the latter on
heating the solution. The intermediate olive colour of the solutions corresponds to the
incipient decomposition of the hexahydrated salt and its passage into CoI<sub>2</sub>4H<sub>2</sub>O. A
solution of the hexahydrated chloride of cobalt, CoCl<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O, is rose-coloured between
-22° and +25°; but the colour changes starting from +25°, and passes through all
the tints between red and blue right up to 50°; a true blue solution is only obtained
at 55° and remains up to 300°. This true blue solution contains another hydrate,
CoCl<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>The dependence between the solubility of the iodide and chloride of cobalt and
the temperature is expressed by two almost straight lines corresponding to the hexa- and
di-hydrates; the passage of the one into the other hydrate being expressed by a
curve. The same character of phenomena is seen also in the variation of the vapour
tension of solutions of chloride of cobalt with the temperature. We have repeatedly
seen that aqueous solutions (for instance, Chapter XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_23_426">23</a> for Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>) deposit
different crystallo-hydrates at different temperatures, and that the amount of water
in the hydrate decreases as the temperature <i>t</i> rises, so that it is not surprising that
CoCl<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O (or according to Potilitzin CoCl<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O) should separate out above 55° and
CoCl<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O at 25° and below. Nor is it exceptional that the colour of a salt varies
according as it contains different amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O. But in this instance it is characteristic
that the change of colour takes place in solution in the presence of an excess of
water. This apparently shows that the actual solution may contain either CoCl<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O or
CoCl<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O. And as we know that a solution may contain both metaphosphoric PHO<sub>3</sub>
and orthophosphoric acid H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> = HPO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O, as well as certain other anhydrides,
the question of the state of substances in solutions becomes still more complicated.</p>

<p>Nickel sulphate crystallises from neutral solutions at a temperature of from 15° to 20°
in <i>rhombic</i> crystals containing 7H<sub>2</sub>O. Its form approaches very closely to that of the
salts of zinc and magnesium. The planes of a vertical prism for magnesium salts are
inclined at an angle of 90° 30&#8242;, for zinc salts at an angle of 91° 7&#8242;, and for nickel salts at
an angle of 91° 10&#8242;. Such is also the form of the zinc and magnesium selenates and
chromates. Cobalt sulphate containing 7 molecules of water is deposited in crystals
of the <i>monoclinic</i> system, like the corresponding salts of iron and manganese. The angle
of a vertical prism for the iron salt = 82° 20&#8242;, for cobalt = 82° 22&#8242;, and the inclination of
the horizontal pinacoid to the vertical prism for the iron salt = 99° 2&#8242;, and for the cobalt
salt 99° 36&#8242;. All the isomorphous mixtures of the salts of magnesium, iron, cobalt,
nickel and manganese have the same form if they contain 7 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O and iron or cobalt
predominate, whilst if there is a preponderance of magnesium, zinc, or nickel, the
crystals have a rhombic form like magnesium sulphate. Hence these sulphates are
<i>dimorphous</i>, but for some the one form is more stable and for others the other. Brooke,
Moss, Mitscherlich, Rammelsberg, and Marignac have explained these relations. Brooke
and Mitscherlich also supposed that NiSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O is not only capable of assuming these
forms, but also that of the <i>tetragonal</i> system, because it is deposited in this form from
acid, and especially from slightly-heated solutions (30° to 40°). But Marignac demonstrated
that the tetragonal crystals do not contain 7, but 6, molecules of water, NiSO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O.
He also observed that a solution evaporated at 50° to 70° deposits monoclinic crystals,
but of a different form from ferrous sulphate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;namely, the angle of the
prism is 71° 52&#8242;, that of the pinacoid 95° 6&#8242;. This salt appears to be the same with 6
molecules of water as the tetragonal. Marignac also obtained magnesium and zinc
salts with 6 molecules of water by evaporating their solutions at a higher temperature,
and these salts were found to be isomorphous with the monoclinic nickel salt.
In addition to this it must be observed that the rhombic crystals of nickel sulphate with
7H<sub>2</sub>O become turbid under the influence of heat and light, lose water, and change into
the tetragonal salt. The monoclinic crystals in time also become turbid, and change
their structure, so that the tetragonal form of this salt is the most stable. Let us also
add that nickel sulphate in all its shapes forms very beautiful emerald green crystals,
which, when heated to 230°, assume a dirty greenish-yellow hue and then contain one
molecule of water.</p>

<p>Klobb (1891) and Langlot and Lenoir obtained anhydrous CoSO<sub>4</sub> and NiSO<sub>4</sub> by
igniting the hydrated salt with (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> until the ammonium salt had completely
volatilised and decomposed.</p>

<p>We may add that when equivalent aqueous solutions of NiX<sub>2</sub> (green) and CoX<sub>2</sub> (red)
are mixed together they give an almost colourless (grey) solution, in which the green and
red colour of the component parts disappears owing to the combination of the complementary
colours.</p>

<p>A double salt NiKF<sub>3</sub> is obtained by heating NiCl<sub>2</sub> with KFHF in a platinum crucible;
KCoF<sub>3</sub> is formed in a similar manner. The nickel salt occurs in fine green plates, easily
soluble in water but scarcely soluble in ethyl and methyl alcohol. They decompose into
green oxide of nickel and potassium fluoride when heated in a current of air. The
analogous salt of cobalt crystallises in crimson flakes.</p>

<p>If instead of potassium fluoride, CoCl<sub>2</sub> or NiCl<sub>2</sub> be fused with ammonium fluoride,
they also form double salts with the latter. This gives the possibility of obtaining
anhydrous fluorides NiF<sub>2</sub> and CoF<sub>2</sub>. Crystalline fluoride of nickel, obtained by
heating the amorphous powder formed by decomposing the double ammonium salt in
a stream of hydrofluoric acid, occurs in beautiful green prisms, sp. gr. 4·63, which are
insoluble in water, alcohol, and ether; sulphuric, hydrochloric, and nitric acids also have
no action upon them, even when heated; NiF<sub>2</sub> is decomposed by steam, with the formation
of black oxide, which retains the crystalline structure of the salt. Fluoride of
cobalt, obtained as a rose-coloured powder by decomposing the double ammonium salt
with the aid of heat in a stream of hydrofluoric acid, fuses into a ruby-coloured mass
which bears distinct signs of a crystalline structure; sp. gr. 4·43. The molten salt
only volatilises at about 1400°, which forms a clear distinction between CoF<sub>2</sub> and the
volatile NiF<sub>2</sub>. Hydrochloric, sulphuric, and nitric acids act upon CoF<sub>2</sub> even in the cold,
although slowly, while when heated the reaction proceeds rapidly (Poulenc, 1892).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_443" id="Footnote_34_443"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_443"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Hydrated suboxide of cobalt (de Schulten, 1889) is obtained in the following
manner. A solution of 10 grams of CoCl<sub>2</sub>6H<sub>2</sub>O in 60 c.c. of water is heated in a flask
with 250 grams of caustic potash and a stream of coal gas is passed through the solution.
When heated the hydrate of the suboxide of cobalt which separates out, dissolves in the
caustic potash and forms a dark blue solution. This solution is allowed to stand for 24
hours in an atmosphere of coal gas (in order to prevent oxidation). The crystalline mass
which separates out has a composition Co(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and to the naked eye appears as a violet
powder, which is seen to be crystalline under the microscope. The specific gravity of
this hydrate is 3·597 at 15°. It does not undergo change in the air; warm acetic acid
dissolves it, but it is insoluble in warm and cold solutions of ammonia and sal-ammoniac.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_BIS_444" id="Footnote_34_BIS_444"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_BIS_444"><span class="label">[34 bis]</span></a> The following reaction may be added to those of the cobaltous and nickelous
salts: potassium cyanide forms a precipitate with cobalt salts which is soluble in an
excess of the reagent and forms a green solution. On heating this and adding a certain
quantity of acid, a double <i>cobalt cyanide</i> is formed which corresponds with potassium
ferricyanide. Its formation is accompanied with the evolution of hydrogen, and is
founded upon the property which cobalt has of oxidising in an alkaline solution, the development
of which has been observed in such a considerable measure in the cobaltamine
salts. The process which goes on here may be expressed by the following equation;
CoC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> + 4KCN first forms CoK<sub>4</sub>C<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>, which salt with water, H<sub>2</sub>O, forms potassium
hydroxide, KHO, hydrogen, H, and the salt, K<sub>3</sub>CoC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub>. Here naturally the presence of
the acid is indispensable in consequence of its being required to combine with the alkali.
From aqueous solutions this salt crystallises in transparent, hexagonal prisms of a yellow
colour, easily soluble in water. The reactions of double decomposition, and even the
formation of the corresponding acid, are here completely the same as in the case of the
ferricyanide. If a nickelous salt be treated in precisely the same manner as that just
described for a salt of cobalt, decomposition will occur.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_445" id="Footnote_35_445"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_445"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> The cobalt salts may be divided into at least the following classes, which repeat
themselves for Cr, Ir, Rh (we shall not stop to consider the latter, particularly as they
closely resemble the cobalt salts):&mdash;</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Ammonium cobalt salts</i>, which are simply direct compounds of the cobaltous
salts CoX<sub>2</sub> with ammonia, similar to various other compounds of the salts of silver,
copper, and even calcium and magnesium, with ammonia. They are easily crystallised
from an ammoniacal solution, and have a pink colour. Thus, for instance, when
cobaltous chloride in solution is mixed with sufficient ammonia to redissolve the
precipitate first formed, octahedral crystals are deposited which have a composition
CoCl<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,6NH<sub>3</sub>. These salts are nothing else but combinations with ammonia of
crystallisation&mdash;if it may be so termed&mdash;likening them in this way to combinations with
water of crystallisation. This similarity is evident both from their composition and from
their capability of giving off ammonia at various temperatures. The most important
point to observe is that all these salts contain 6 molecules of ammonia to 1 atom of cobalt,
and this ammonia is held in fairly stable connection. Water decomposes these salts. (Nickel
behaves similarly without forming other compounds corresponding to the true cobaltic.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The solutions of the above-mentioned salts are rendered turbid by the action of
the air; they absorb oxygen and become covered with a crust of <i>oxycobaltamine salts</i>.
The latter are sparingly soluble in aqueous ammonia, have a brown colour, and are
characterised by the fact that with warm water <i>they evolve oxygen</i>, forming salts of the
following category: The nitrate may be taken as an example of this kind of salt; its
composition is CoN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. It differs from cobaltous nitrate, Co(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, in containing
an extra atom of oxygen&mdash;that is, it corresponds with cobalt dioxide, CoO<sub>2</sub>, in
the same way that the first salts correspond with cobaltous oxide; they contain 5, and
not 6, molecules of ammonia, as if NH<sub>3</sub> had been replaced by O, but we shall afterwards
meet compounds containing either 5NH<sub>3</sub> or 6NH<sub>3</sub> to each atom of cobalt.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>The luteocobaltic salts</i> are thus called because they have a yellow (luteus)
colour. They are obtained from the salts of the first kind by submitting them in dilute
solution to the action of the air; in this case salts of the second kind are not formed,
because they are decomposed by an excess of water, with the evolution of oxygen and
the formation of luteocobaltic salts. By the action of ammonia the salts of the fifth
kind (roseocobaltic) are also converted into luteocobaltic salts. These last-named salts
generally crystallise readily, and have a yellow colour; they are comparatively much
more stable than the preceding ones, and even for a certain time resist the action of
boiling water. Boiling aqueous potash liberates ammonia and precipitates hydrated
cobaltic oxide, Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, from them. This shows that the luteocobaltic salts correspond
with cobaltic oxide, Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and those of the second kind with the dioxide.
When a solution of luteocobaltic sulphate, Co<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,12NH<sub>3</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, is treated with
baryta, barium sulphate is precipitated, and the solution contains luteocobaltic
hydroxide, Co(OH)<sub>3</sub>,6NH<sub>3</sub>, which is soluble in water, is powerfully alkaline, absorbs
the oxygen of the air, and when heated is decomposed with the evolution of ammonia.
This compound therefore corresponds to a solution of cobaltic hydroxide in
ammonia. The luteocobaltic salts contain 2 atoms of cobalt and 12 molecules of
ammonia&mdash;that is, 6NH<sub>3</sub> to each atom of cobalt, like the salts of the first kind. The
CoX<sub>2</sub> salts have a metallic taste, whilst those of luteocobalt and others have a purely
saline taste, like the salts of the alkali metals. In the luteo-salts all the X's react (are
ionised, as some chemists say) as in ordinary salts&mdash;for instance, all the Cl<sub>2</sub> is precipitated
by a solution of AgNO<sub>3</sub>; all the (SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> gives a precipitate with BaX<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.
The double salt formed with PtCl<sub>4</sub> is composed in the same manner as the potassium
salt, K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub> = 2KCl + PtCl<sub>4</sub>, that is, contains (CoCl<sub>3</sub>,6NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,3PtCl<sub>4</sub>, or the amount of
chlorine in the PtCl<sub>4</sub> is double that in the alkaline salt. In the rosepentamine (<i>e</i>), and
rosetetramine (<i>f</i>), salts, also all the X's react or are ionised, but in the (<i>g</i>) and (<i>h</i>) salts
only a portion of the X's react, and they are equal to the (<i>e</i>) and (<i>f</i>) salts minus water;
this means that although the water dissolves them it is not combined with them, as
PHO<sub>3</sub> differs from PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; phenomena of this class correspond exactly to what has
been already (Chapter XXI., Note <a href="#Footnote_7_375">7</a>) mentioned respecting the green and violet salts of
oxide of chromium.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>The fuscocobaltic salts.</i> An ammoniacal solution of cobalt salts acquires a brown
colour in the air, due to the formation of these salts. They are also produced by the
decomposition of salts of the second kind; they crystallise badly, and are separated from
their solutions by addition of alcohol or an excess of ammonia. When boiled they give
up the ammonia and cobaltic oxide which they contain. Hydrochloric and nitric acids
give a yellow precipitate with these salts, which turns red when boiled, forming salts of
the next category. The following is an example of the composition of two of the fuscocobaltic
salts, Co<sub>2</sub>O(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,8NH<sub>3</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O and Co<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>4</sub>,8NH<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. It is evident that the
fuscocobaltic salts are ammoniacal compounds of basic cobaltic salts. The normal cobaltic
sulphate ought to have the composition Co<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> = Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3SO<sub>3</sub>; the simplest
basic salts will be Co<sub>2</sub>O(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)2SO<sub>3</sub>, and Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>) = Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,SO<sub>3</sub>. The fuscocobaltic
salts correspond with the first type of basic salts. They are changed (in concentrated
solutions) into oxycobaltamine salts by absorption of one atom of oxygen,
Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. The whole process of oxidation will be as follows: first of all Co<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub>, a
cobaltous salt, is in the solution (X a univalent haloid, 2 molecules of the salt being
taken), then Co<sub>2</sub>OX<sub>4</sub>, the basic cobaltic salt (4th series), then Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub>, the salt of the
dioxide (2nd series). The series of basic salts with an acid, 2HX, forms water and a
normal salt, Co<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub> (in 3, 5, 6 series). These salts are combined with various amounts of
water and ammonia. Under many conditions the salts of fuscocobalt are easily transformed
into salts of the next series. The salts of the series that has just been described
contain 4 molecules of ammonia to 1 atom of cobalt.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) <i>The roseocobaltic</i> (or rosepentamine), CoX<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O,5NH<sub>3</sub>, <i>salts</i>, like the luteocobaltic,
correspond with the normal cobaltic salts, but contain less ammonia, and an
extra molecule of water. Thus the sulphate is obtained from cobaltous sulphate
dissolved in ammonia and left exposed to the air until transformed into a brown solution
of the fuscocobaltic salt; when this is treated with sulphuric acid a crystalline powder
of the roseocobaltic salt, Co<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,10NH<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, separates. The formation of this salt
is easily understood: cobaltous sulphate in the presence of ammonia absorbs oxygen, and
the solution of the fuscocobaltic salt will therefore contain, like cobaltous sulphate, one
part of sulphuric acid to every part of cobalt, so that the whole process of formation may
be expressed by the equation: 10NH<sub>3</sub> + 2CoSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O + O = Co<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>,10NH<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O.
This salt forms tetragonal crystals of a red colour, slightly soluble in cold, but
readily soluble in warm water. When the sulphate is treated with baryta, roseocobaltic
hydroxide is formed in the solution, which absorbs the carbonic anhydride of the air.
It is obtained from the next series by the action of alkalis.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The <i>rosetetramine cobaltic salts</i> CoCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O,4NH<sub>3</sub> were obtained by Jörgenson,
and belong to the type of the luteo-salts, only with the substitution of 2NH<sub>3</sub> for H<sub>2</sub>O.
Like the luteo- and roseo-salts they give double salts with PtCl<sub>4</sub>, similar to the alkaline
double salts, for instance (Co<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O,4NH<sub>3</sub>)2(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub>. They are darker in colour
than the preceding, but also crystallise well. They are formed by dissolving CoCO<sub>3</sub> in
sulphuric acid (of a given strength), and after NH<sub>3</sub> and carbonate of ammonium have
been added, air is passed through the solution (for oxidation) until the latter turns red.
It is then evaporated with lumps of carbonate of ammonium, filtered from the precipitate
and crystallised. A salt of the composition Co<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>),(2H<sub>2</sub>O,4NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is thus
obtained, from which the other salts may be easily prepared.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The <i>purpureocobaltic salts</i>, CoX<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, are also products of the direct oxidation
of ammoniacal solutions of cobalt salts. They are easily obtained by heating the roseocobaltic
and luteo-salts with strong acids. They are to all effects the same as the
roseocobaltic salts, only anhydrous. Thus, for instance, the purpureocobaltic chloride,
Co<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,10NH<sub>3</sub>, or CoCl<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, is obtained by boiling the oxycobaltamine salts with
ammonia. There is the same distinction between these salts and the preceding ones as
between the various compounds of cobaltous chloride with water. In the purpureocobaltic
only X<sub>2</sub> out of the X<sub>3</sub> react (are ionised). To the rosetetramine salts (<i>f</i>) there
correspond the <i>purpureotetramine</i> salts, CoX<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O,4NH<sub>3</sub>. The corresponding chromium
purpureopentamine salt, CrCl<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub> is obtained with particular ease (Christensen, 1893).
Dry anhydrous chromium chloride is treated with anhydrous liquid ammonia in a
freezing mixture composed of liquid CO<sub>2</sub> and chlorine, and after some time the mixture
is taken out of the freezing mixture, so that the excess of NH<sub>3</sub> boils away; the violet
crystals then immediately acquire the red colour of the salt, CrCl<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, which is formed.
The product is washed with water (to extract the luteo-salt, CrCl<sub>3</sub>,6NH<sub>3</sub>), which does not
dissolve the salt, and it is then recrystallised from a hot solution of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>(<i>h</i>) The <i>praseocobaltic salts</i>, CoX<sub>3</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>, are green, and form, with respect to the
rosetetramine salts (<i>f</i>), the products of ultimate dehydration (for example, like metaphosphoric
acid with respect to orthophosphoric acid, but in dissolving in water they give
neither rosetetramine nor tetramine salts. (In my opinion one should expect salts with
a still smaller amount of NH<sub>3</sub>, of the blue colour proper to the low hydrated compounds
of cobalt; the green colour of the prazeo-salts already forms a step towards the blue.)
Jörgenson obtained salts for ethylene-diamine, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> which replaces 2NH<sub>3</sub>. After
being kept a long time in aqueous solution they give rosetetramine salts, just as metaphosphoric
acid gives orthophosphoric acid, while the rosetetramine salts are converted
into prazeo-salts by Ag<sub>2</sub>O and NaHO. Here only one X is ionised out of the X<sub>3</sub>. There
are also basic salts of the same type; but the best known is the chromium salt called the
rhodozochromic salt, Cr<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>,6NH<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, which is formed by the prolonged action
of water upon the corresponding roseo-salt.</p>

<p>The cobaltamine compounds differ essentially but little from the ammoniacal compounds
of other metals. The only difference is that here the cobaltic oxide is obtained
from the cobaltous oxide in the presence of ammonia. In any case it is a simpler question
than that of the double cyanides. Those forces in virtue of which such a considerable
number of ammonia molecules are united with a molecule of a cobalt compound, appertain
naturally to the series of those slightly investigated forces which exist even in the
highest degrees of combination of the majority of elements. They are the same forces
which lead to the formation of compounds containing water of crystallisation, double
salts, isomorphous mixtures and complex acids (Chapter XXI., Note <a href="#Footnote_8_BIS_378">8 bis</a>). The
simplest conception, according to my opinion, of cobalt compounds (much more so than
by assuming special complex radicles, with Schiff, Weltzien, Claus, and others), may be
formed by comparing them with other ammoniacal products. Ammonia, like water, combines
in various proportions with a multitude of molecules. Silver chloride and calcium
chloride, just like cobalt chloride, absorb ammonia, forming compounds which are sometimes
slightly stable, and easily dissociated, sometimes more stable, in exactly the same
way as water combines with certain substances, forming fairly stable compounds called
hydroxides or hydrates, or less stable compounds which are called compounds with water
of crystallisation. Naturally the difference in the properties in both cases depends on
the properties of those elements which enter into the composition of the given substance,
and on those kinds of affinity towards which chemists have not as yet turned their
attention. If boron fluoride, silicon fluoride, &amp;c., combine with hydrofluoric acid, if
platinic chloride, and even cadmium chloride, combine with hydrochloric acid, these
compounds may be regarded as double salts, because acids are salts of hydrogen. But
evidently water and ammonia have the same saline faculty, more especially as they, like
haloid acids, contain hydrogen, and are both capable of further combination&mdash;for instance,
ammonia with hydrochloric acid. Hence it is simpler to compare complex ammoniacal
with double salts, hydrates, and similar compounds, but <i>the ammonio-metallic salts</i>
present a most complete qualitative and quantitative resemblance to <i>the hydrated salts
of metals</i>. The composition of the latter is MX<sub><i>n</i></sub><i>m</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, where M = metal, X = the
haloid, simple or complex, and <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> the quantities of the haloid and so-called water
of crystallisation respectively. The composition of the ammoniacal salts of metals is
MX<sub><i>n</i></sub><i>m</i>NH<sub>3</sub>. The water of crystallisation is held by the salt with more or less stability, and
some salts even do not retain it at all; some part with water easily when exposed to the air,
others when heated, and then with difficulty. In the case of some metals all the salts combine
with water, whilst with others only a few, and the water so combined may then be
easily disengaged. All this applies equally well to the ammoniacal salts, and therefore the
combination of ammonia may be termed <i>the ammonia of crystallisation</i>. Just as the
water which is combined with a salt is held by it with different degrees of force, so it is with
ammonia. In combining with 2NH<sub>3</sub>,PtCl<sub>2</sub> evolves 31,000 cals.; while CaCl<sub>2</sub> only evolves
14,000 cals.; and the former compound parts with its NH<sub>3</sub> (together with HCl in this
case) with more difficulty, only above 200°, while the latter disengages ammonia at 180°.
ZnCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> in forming ZnCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub> evolves only 11,000 cals., and splits up again into
its components at 80°. The amount of combined ammonia is as variable as the amount
of water of crystallisation&mdash;for instance, SnI<sub>4</sub>8NH<sub>3</sub>, CrCl<sub>2</sub>8NH<sub>3</sub>, CrCl<sub>3</sub>6NH<sub>3</sub>, CrCl<sub>3</sub>5NH<sub>3</sub>,PtCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. are known. Very often NH<sub>3</sub> is replaceable by OH<sub>2</sub> and conversely. A
colourless, anhydrous cupric salt&mdash;for instance, cupric sulphate&mdash;when combined with
water forms blue and green salts, and violet when combined with ammonia. If steam be
passed through anhydrous copper sulphate the salt absorbs water and becomes heated; if
ammonia be substituted for the water the heating becomes much more intense, and the
salt breaks up into a fine violet powder. With water CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O is formed, and with
ammonia CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, the number of water and ammonia molecules retained by the
salt being the same in each case, and as a proof of this, and that it is not an isolated
coincidence, the remarkable fact must be borne in mind that water and ammonia consecutively,
molecule for molecule, are capable of supplanting each other, and forming the
compounds CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, CuSO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O,NH<sub>3</sub>; CuSO<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O,2NH<sub>3</sub>; CuSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O,3NH<sub>3</sub>;
CuSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,4NH<sub>3</sub>, and CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>. The last of these compounds was obtained by
Henry Rose, and my experiments have shown that more ammonia than this cannot be
retained. By adding to a strong solution of cupric sulphate sufficient ammonia to
dissolve the whole of the oxide precipitated, and then adding alcohol, Berzelius obtained
the compound CuSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,4NH<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. The law of substitution also assists in rendering
these phenomena clearer, because a compound of ammonia with water forms ammonium
hydroxide, NH<sub>4</sub>HO, and therefore these molecules combining with one another may also
interchange, as being of equal value. In general, those salts form stable ammoniacal
compounds which are capable of forming stable compounds with water of crystallisation;
and as ammonia is capable of combining with acids, and as some of the salts formed by
slightly energetic bases in their properties more closely resemble acids (that is, salts of
hydrogen) than those salts containing more energetic bases, we might expect to find
more stable and more easily-formed ammonio-metallic salts with metals and their
oxides having weaker basic properties than with those which form energetic bases. This
explains why the salts of potassium, barium, &amp;c., do not form ammonio-metallic salts,
whilst the salts of silver, copper, zinc, &amp;c., easily form them, and the salts RX<sub>3</sub> still
more easily and with greater stability. This consideration also accounts for the great
stability of the ammoniacal compounds of cupric oxide compared with those of silver
oxide, since the former is displaced by the latter. It also enables us to see clearly the
distinction which exists in the stability of the cobaltamine salts containing salts corresponding
with cobaltous oxide, and those corresponding with higher oxides of cobalt,
for the latter are weaker bases than cobaltous oxides. <i>The nature of the forces
and quality of the phenomena occurring during the formation of the most stable substances,
and of such compounds as crystallisable compounds, are one and the same,
although perhaps exhibited in a different degree.</i> This, in my opinion, may be best
confirmed by examining the compounds of carbon, because for this element the nature
of the forces acting during the formation of its compounds is well known. Let us take
as an example two unstable compounds of carbon. Acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (specific gravity
1·06), with water forms the hydrate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, denser (1·07) than either of the components,
but unstable and easily decomposed, generally simply referred to as a
solution. Such also is the crystalline compound of oxalic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, with water,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. Their formation might be predicted as starting from the hydrocarbon
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, in which, as in any other, the hydrogen may be exchanged for chlorine, the
water residue (hydroxyl), &amp;c. The first substitution product with hydroxyl, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(HO),
is stable; it can be distilled without alteration, resists a temperature higher than 100°,
and then does not give off water. This is ordinary alcohol. The second, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub>,
can also be distilled without change, but can be decomposed into water and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O
(ethylene oxide or aldehyde); it boils at about 197°, whilst the first hydrate boils at 78°,
a difference of about 100°. The compound C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(HO)<sub>3</sub> will be the third product of such
substitution; it ought to boil at about 300°, but does not resist this temperature&mdash;it decomposes
into H<sub>2</sub>O and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, where only one hydroxyl group remains, and the other
atom of oxygen is left in the same condition as in ethylene oxide, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O. There is a proof
of this. Glycol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub>, boils at 197°, and forms water and ethylene oxide, which
boils at 13° (aldehyde, its isomeride, boils at 21°); therefore the product disengaged by
the splitting up of the hydrate boils at 184° lower than the hydrate C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub>. Thus
the hydrate C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(HO)<sub>3</sub>, which ought to boil at about 300°, splits up in exactly the same
way into water and the product C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which boils at 117°&mdash;that is, nearly 183° lower
than the hydrate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(HO)<sub>3</sub>. But this hydrate splits up before distillation. The
above-mentioned hydrate of acetic acid is such a decomposable hydrate&mdash;that is to
say, what is called a solution. Still less stability may be expected from the following
hydrates. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>4</sub> also splits up into water and a hydrate (it contains two hydroxyl
groups) called glycolic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O(HO)<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The next product of substitution
will be C<sub>2</sub>H(HO)<sub>5</sub>; it splits up into water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and glyoxylic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (three
hydroxyl groups). The last hydrate which ought to be obtained from C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and ought
to contain C<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>6</sub>, is the crystalline compound of oxalic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (two hydroxyl
groups), and water, 2H<sub>2</sub>O, which has been already mentioned. The hydrate C<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>6</sub>
= C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, ought, according to the foregoing reasoning, to boil at about 600°
(because the hydrate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub>, boils at about 200°, and the substitution of 4 hydroxyl
groups for 4 atoms of hydrogen will raise the boiling-point 400°). It does not resist this
temperature, but at a much lower point splits up into water, 2H<sub>2</sub>O, and the hydrate
C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub>, which is also capable of yielding water. Without going into further discussion
of this subject, it may be observed that the formation of the hydrates, or compounds
with water of crystallisation, of acetic and oxalic acids has thus received an
accurate explanation, illustrating the point we desired to prove in affirming that compounds
with water of crystallisation are held together by the same forces as those which
act in the formation of other complex substances, and that the easy displaceability
of the water of crystallisation is only a peculiarity of a local character, and not
a radical point of distinction. All the above-mentioned hydrates, C<sub>2</sub>X<sub>6</sub>, or products
of their destruction, are actually obtained by the oxidation of the first hydrate,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(HO), or common alcohol, by nitric acid (Sokoloff and others). Hence the forces
which induce salts to combine with <i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O or with NH<sub>3</sub> are undoubtedly of the same
order as the forces which govern the formation of ordinary &lsquo;atomic&rsquo; and saline compounds.
(A great impediment in the study of the former was caused by the conviction
which reigned in the sixties and seventies, that &lsquo;atomic&rsquo; were essentially different
from &lsquo;molecular&rsquo; compounds like crystallohydrates, in which it was assumed that
there was a combination of entire molecules, as though without the participation of the
atomic forces.) If the bond between chlorine and different metals is not equally strong,
so also the bond uniting <i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O and <i>n</i>NH<sub>3</sub> is exceeding variable; there is nothing very
surprising in this. And in the fact that the combination of different amounts of NH<sub>3</sub>
and H<sub>2</sub>O alters the capacity of the haloids X of the salts RX<sub>2</sub> for reaction (for instance,
in the luteo-salts all the X<sub>3</sub>, while in the purpureo, only 2 out of the 3, and in the prazeo-salts
only 1 of the 3 X's reacts), we should see in the first place a phenomenon similar
to what we met with in Cr<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> (Chapter XXI., Note <a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_376">7 bis</a>), for in both instances the essence
of the difference lies in the removal of water; a molecule RCl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O or RCl<sub>3</sub>,6NH<sub>3</sub>
contains the halogen in a perfectly mobile (ionised) state, while in the molecule
RCl<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O or RCl<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub> a portion of the halogen has almost lost its faculty for reacting
with AgNO<sub>3</sub>, just as metalepsical chlorine has lost this faculty which is fully developed in
the chloranhydride. Until the reason of this difference be clear, we cannot expect that
ordinary points of view and generalisation can give a clear answer. However, we may
assume that here the explanation lies in the nature and kind of motion of the atoms in the
molecules, although as yet it is not clear how. Nevertheless, I think it well to call
attention again (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_40">I.</a>) to the fact that the combination of water, and hence, also,
of any other element, leads to most diverse consequences; the water in the gelatinous
hydrate of alumina or in the decahydrated Glauber salt is very mobile, and easily reacts
like water in a free state; but the same water combined with oxide of calcium, or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>
(for instance, in C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O and in C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O), or with P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, has become quite different, and no
longer acts like water in a free state. We see the same phenomenon in many other
cases&mdash;for example, the chlorine in chlorates no longer gives a precipitate of chloride of
silver with AgNO<sub>3</sub>. Thus, although the instance which is found in the difference
between the roseo- and purpureo-salts deserves to be fully studied on account of its simplicity,
still it is far from being exceptional, and we cannot expect it to be thoroughly
explained unless a mass of similar instances, which are exceedingly common among
chemical compounds, be conjointly explained. (Among the researches which add to
our knowledge respecting the complex ammoniacal compounds, I think it indispensable
to call the reader's attention to Prof. Kournakoff's dissertation &lsquo;On complex metallic
bases,&rsquo; 1893.)</p>

<p>Kournakoff (1894) showed that the solubility of the luteo-salt, CoCl<sub>3</sub>,6NH<sub>3</sub>, at 0°
= 4·30 (per 100 of water), at 20° = 7·7, that in passing into the roseo-salt, CoCl<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>,
the solubility rises considerably, and at 0° = 16·4, and at 20° = about 27, whilst the
passage into the purpureo-salt, CoCl<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, is accompanied by a great fall in the
solubility, namely, at 0° = 0·23, and at 20° = about 0·5. And as crystallohydrates with a
smaller amount of water are usually more soluble than the higher crystallohydrates (Le
Chatelier), whilst here we find that the solubility falls (in the purpureo-salt) with a loss
of water, that water which is contained in the roseo-salt cannot be compared with the
water of crystallisation. Kournakoff, therefore, connects the fall in solubility (in the
passage of the roseo- into the purpureo-salts) with the accompanying loss in the reactive
capacity of the chlorine.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be observed that the elements of the eighth group&mdash;that is, the
analogues of iron and platinum&mdash;according to my opinion, will yield most fruitful results
when studied as to combinations with whole molecules, as already shown by the examples
of complex ammoniacal, cyanogen, nitro-, and other compounds, which are easily formed
in this eighth group, and are remarkable for their stability. This faculty of the elements
of the eighth group for forming the complex compounds alluded to, is in all probability
connected with the position which the eighth group occupies with regard to the others.
Following the seventh, which forms the type RX<sub>7</sub>, it might be expected to contain the
most complex type, RX<sub>8</sub>. This is met with in OsO<sub>4</sub>. The other elements of the eighth
group, however, only form the lower types RX<sub>2</sub>, RX<sub>3</sub>, RX<sub>4</sub> &hellip; and these accordingly
should be expected to aggregate themselves into the higher types, which is accomplished
in the formation of the above-mentioned complex compounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_447" id="Footnote_36_447"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_447"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> The action of an alkaline hypochlorite or hypobromite upon a boiling solution of
cobaltous salts, according to Schroederer (1889), produces oxides, whose composition
varies between Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (Rose's compound) and Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and also between Co<sub>5</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and
Co<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub>. If caustic potash and then bromine be added to the liquid, only Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is
formed. The action of alkaline hypochlorites or hypo-bromites, or of iodine, upon
cobaltic salts, gives a highly-coloured precipitate which has a different colour to the
hydrate of the oxide Co<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>. According to Carnot the precipitate produced by the
hypochlorites has a composition Co<sub>10</sub>O<sub>16</sub>, whilst that given by iodine in the presence of
an alkali contains a larger amount of oxygen. Fortmann (1891) re-investigated the
composition of the higher oxygen oxide obtained by iodine in the presence of alkali, and
found that the greenish precipitate (which disengages oxygen when heated to 100°)
corresponds to the formula CoO<sub>2</sub>. The reaction must be expressed by the equation:
CoX<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> + 4KHO = CoO<sub>2</sub> + 2KX + 2KI + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_448" id="Footnote_37_448"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_448"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Prior to Fortmann, Rousseau (1889) endeavoured to solve the question as to
whether CoO<sub>2</sub> was able to combine with bases. He succeeded in obtaining a barium
compound corresponding to this oxide. Fifteen grams of BaCl<sub>2</sub> or BaBr<sub>2</sub> are triturated
with 5&ndash;6 grams of oxide of barium, and the mixture heated to redness in a closed
platinum crucible; 1 gram of oxide of cobalt is then gradually added to the fused mass.
Each addition of oxide is accompanied by a violent disengagement of oxygen. After a
short time, however, the mass fuses quietly, and a salt settles at the bottom of the
crucible, which, when freed from the residue, appears as black hexagonal, very brilliant
crystals. In dissolving in water this substance evolves chlorine; its composition corresponds
to the formula 2(CoO<sub>2</sub>)BaO. If the original mass be heated for a long time
(40 hours), the amount of dioxide in the resultant mass decreases. The author obtained
a neutral salt having the composition CoO<sub>2</sub>BaO (this compound = BaO<sub>2</sub>CoO)
by breaking up the mass as it agglomerates together, and bringing the pieces into
contact with the more heated surface of the crucible. This salt is formed between the
somewhat narrow limits of temperature 1,000°-1,100°; above and below these limits
compounds richer or poorer in CoO<sub>2</sub> are formed. The formation of CoO<sub>2</sub> by the action
of BaO<sub>2</sub>, and the easy decomposition of CoO<sub>2</sub> with the evolution of oxygen, give reason
for thinking that it belongs to the class of peroxides (like Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, CaO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.); it is not yet
known whether they give peroxide of hydrogen like the true peroxides. The fact that
it is obtained by means of iodine (probably through HIO), and its great resemblance
to MnO<sub>2</sub>, leads rather to the supposition that CoO<sub>2</sub> is a very feeble saline oxide. The
form CoO<sub>2</sub> is repeated in the cobaltic compounds (Note <a href="#Footnote_35_445">35</a>), and the existence of CoO<sub>2</sub>
should have long ago been recognised upon this basis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_449" id="Footnote_38_449"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_449"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> This compound is known as nickel tetra-carbonyl. It appears to me yet premature
to judge of the structure of such an extraordinary compound as Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>. It has long
been known that potassium combines with CO forming K<sub><i>n</i></sub>(CO)<sub><i>n</i></sub> (Chapter IX., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_31_546">31</a>),
but this substance is apparently saline and non-volatile, and has as little in common
with Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub> as Na<sub>2</sub>H has with SbH<sub>3</sub>. However, Berthelot observed that when NiC<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
is kept in air, it oxidises and gives a colourless compound, Ni<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, having
apparently saline properties. We may add that Schützenberger, on reducing NiCl<sub>2</sub> by
heating it in a current of hydrogen, observed that a nickel compound partially volatilises
with the HCl and gives metallic nickel when heated again. The platinum compound,
PtCl<sub>2</sub>(CO)<sub>3</sub> (Chapter XXIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_11_468">11</a>), offers the greatest analogy to Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>. This
compound was obtained as a volatile substance by Schützenberger by moderately
heating (to 235°) metallic platinum in a mixture of chlorine and carbonic oxide. If we
designate CO by Y, and an atom of chlorine by X, then taking into account that,
according to the periodic system, Ni is an analogue of Pt, a certain degree of correspondence
is seen in the composition NiY<sub>4</sub> and PtX<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>2</sub>. It would be interesting to
compare the reactions of the two compounds.</p></div>

increases. A similar difference is to be found in other groups and series, and proves

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE PLATINUM METALS</span></h2>

<p>The six metals: ruthenium, Ru, rhodium, Rh, palladium, Pd, osmium,
Os, iridium, Ir, and platinum, Pt, are met with associated together in
nature. Platinum always predominates over the others, and hence
they are known as the <i>platinum metals</i>. By their chemical character
their position in the periodic system is in the eighth group, corresponding
with iron, cobalt, and nickel.</p>

<p>The natural transition from titanium and vanadium to copper and
zinc by means of the elements of the iron group is demonstrated by all
the properties of these elements, and in exactly the same manner a
transition from zirconium, niobium, and molybdenum to silver, cadmium,
and indium, through ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium, is in perfect
accordance with fact and with the magnitude of the atomic weights, as
also is the position of osmium, iridium, and platinum between tantalum
and tungsten on the one side, and gold and mercury on the other. In
all these three cases the elements of smaller atomic weight (chromium,
molybdenum, and tungsten) are able, in their higher grades of
oxidation, to give acid oxides having the properties of distinct but
feebly energetic acids (in the lower oxides they give bases), whilst the
elements of greater atomic weight (zinc, cadmium, mercury), even in
their higher grades of oxidation, only give bases, although with feebly
developed basic properties. The platinum metals present the same
intermediate properties such as we have already seen in iron and the
elements of the eighth group.</p>

<p>In the platinum metals the intermediate properties <i>of feebly acid
and feebly basic metals</i> are developed with great clearness, so that
there is not one sharply-defined acid anhydride among their oxides,
although there is a great diversity in the grades of oxidation from the
type RO<sub>4</sub> to R<sub>2</sub>O. The feebleness of the chemical forces observed in
the platinum metals is connected with the ready decomposability of
their compounds, with the small atomic volume of the metals themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
and with their large atomic weight. The oxides of platinum,
iridium, and osmium can scarcely be termed either basic or acid; they
are capable of combinations of both kinds, each of which is feeble.
They are all intermediate oxides.</p>

<p>The atomic weights of platinum, iridium, and osmium are nearly
191 to 196, and of palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium, 104 to 106.
Thus, strictly speaking, we have here two series of metals, which
are, moreover, perfectly parallel to each other; three members in
the first series, and three members in the second&mdash;namely, platinum
presents an analogy to palladium, iridium to rhodium, and osmium
to ruthenium. As a matter of fact, however, the whole <i>group</i> of the
platinum metals is characterised by <i>a number of common properties</i>,
both physical and chemical, and, moreover, there are several points of
resemblance between the members of this group and those of the <i>iron</i>
group (Chapter <a href="#Page_317">XXII.</a>) The atomic volumes (<a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a>, column 18)
of the elements of this group are <i>nearly equal</i> and <i>very small</i>. The iron
metals have atomic volumes of nearly 7, whilst that of the metals allied
to palladium is nearly 9, and of those adjacent to platinum (Pt, Ir, Os)
nearly 9·4. This comparatively small atomic volume corresponds with
the great infusibility and tenacity proper to all the iron and platinum
metals, and to their small chemical energy, which stands out very
clearly in the heavy platinum metals. All the platinum metals are
very <i>easily reduced</i> by ignition and by the action of various reducing
agents, in which process oxygen, or a haloid group, is disengaged from
their compounds and the metal left behind. This is a property of the
platinum metals which determines many of their reactions, and the
circumstance of their always being found in nature <i>in a native state</i>.
In Russia in the Urals (discovered in 1819) and in Brazil (1735)
platinum is obtained from alluvial deposits, but in 1892 Professor
Inostrantseff discovered a vein deposit of platinum in serpentine near
Tagil in the Urals.<a name="FNanchor_1_452" id="FNanchor_1_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_452" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The facility with which they are reduced is so
great that their chlorides are even decomposed by gaseous hydrogen,
especially when shaken up and heated under a certain pressure. Hence
it will be readily understood that such metals as zinc, iron, &amp;c., separate
them from solutions with great ease, which fact is taken advantage of
in practice and in the chemical treatment of the platinum metals.<a name="FNanchor_1_BIS_453" id="FNanchor_1_BIS_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_BIS_453" class="fnanchor">[1 bis]</a></p>

<p>All the platinum metals, like those of the iron group, are grey, with
a comparatively feeble metallic lustre, and are very infusible. In this
respect they stand in the same order as the metals of the iron series;
nickel is more fusible and whiter than cobalt and iron, so also palladium
is whiter and more fusible than rhodium and ruthenium, and
platinum is comparatively more fusible and whiter than iridium or
osmium. The saline compounds of these metals are red or yellow, like
those of the majority of the metals of the iron series, and like the
latter, the different forms of oxidation present different colours. Moreover,
certain complex compounds of the platinum metals, like certain
complex compounds of the iron series, either have particular characteristic
tints or else are colourless.</p>

<p>The platinum metals are found <i>in nature associated together in
alluvial deposits</i> in a few localities, from which they are washed,
owing to their very considerable density, which enables a stream of
water to wash away the sand and clay with which they are mixed.
Platinum deposits are chiefly known in the Urals, and also in Brazil
and a few other localities. The platinum ore washed from these
alluvial deposits presents the appearance of more or less coarse grains,
and sometimes, as it were, of semi-fused nuggets.<a name="FNanchor_2_454" id="FNanchor_2_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_454" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>All the platinum metals give compounds with the halogens, and the
highest haloid type of combination for all is RX<sub>4</sub>. For the majority
of the platinum metals this type is exceedingly unstable; the lower
compounds corresponding to the type RX<sub>2</sub>, which are formed by the
separation of X<sub>2</sub>, are more stable. In the type RX<sub>2</sub> the platinum
metals form more stable salts, which offer no little resemblance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the kindred compounds of the iron series&mdash;for example, to nickelous
chloride, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, cobaltous chloride, CoCl<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. This even expresses
itself in a similarity of volume (platinous chloride, PtCl<sub>2</sub>, volume, 46;
nickelous chloride, NiCl<sub>2</sub> = 50), although in the type RX<sub>2</sub> the true iron
metals give very stable compounds, whilst the platinum metals frequently
react after the manner of suboxides, decomposing into the
metal and higher types, 2RX<sub>2</sub> = R + RX<sub>4</sub>. This probably depends on
the facility with which RX<sub>2</sub> decomposes into R and X<sub>2</sub>, when X<sub>2</sub>
combines with the remaining portion of RX<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>As in the series iron, cobalt, nickel, nickel gives NiO and Ni<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
whilst cobalt and iron give higher and varied forms of oxidation, so
also among the platinum metals, platinum and palladium only give the
forms RX<sub>2</sub> and RX<sub>4</sub>, whilst rhodium and iridium form another and
intermediate type, RX<sub>3</sub>, also met with in cobalt, corresponding with
the oxide, having the composition R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, besides which they form
an acid oxide, like ferric acid, which is also known in the form of
salts, but is in every respect unstable. <i>Osmium</i> and <i>ruthenium</i>, like
manganese, form still higher oxides, and in this respect exhibit the
greatest diversity. They not only give RX<sub>2</sub>, RX<sub>3</sub>, RX<sub>4</sub>, and RX<sub>6</sub>,
but also a still <i>higher form of oxidation</i>, RO<sub>4</sub>, which is not met with in
any other series. This form is exceedingly characteristic, owing to the
fact that the oxides, OsO<sub>4</sub> and RuO<sub>4</sub>, are volatile and have feebly acid
properties. In this respect they most resemble permanganic anhydride,
which is also somewhat volatile.<a name="FNanchor_3_455" id="FNanchor_3_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_455" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>When dissolved in aqua regia (PtCl<sub>4</sub> is formed) and liberated from
the solution by sal-ammoniac ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> is formed) and reduced by
ignition (which may be done by Zn and other reducing agents, direct
from a solution of PtCl<sub>4</sub>) platinum<a name="FNanchor_3_BIS_456" id="FNanchor_3_BIS_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_BIS_456" class="fnanchor">[3 bis]</a> forms a powdery mass, known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
as spongy platinum or platinum black. If this powder of platinum be
heated and pressed, or hammered in a cylinder, the grains aggregate or
forge together, and form a continuous, though of course not entirely
homogeneous, mass. Platinum was formerly, and is even now, worked
up in this manner. The platinum money formerly used in Russia was
made in this way. Sainte-Claire Deville, in the fifties, for the first
time melted platinum in considerable quantities by employing a special
furnace made in the form of a small reverberatory furnace, and composed
of two pieces of lime, on which the heat of the oxyhydrogen flame
has no action. Into this furnace (shown in fig. 34, Vol. I. p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_175">175</a>)&mdash;or,
more strictly speaking, into the cavity made in the pieces of lime&mdash;the
platinum is introduced, and two orifices are made in the lime; through
one, the upper, or side orifice, is introduced an oxyhydrogen gas burner,
in which either detonating gas or a mixture of oxygen and coal-gas is
burnt, whilst the other orifice serves for the escape of the products of
combustion and certain impurities which are more volatile than the
platinum, and especially the oxidised compounds of osmium, ruthenium,
and palladium, which are comparatively easily volatilised by heat. In
this manner the platinum is converted into a continuous metallic form
by means of fusion, and this method is now used for melting considerable
masses of platinum<a name="FNanchor_4_457" id="FNanchor_4_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_457" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and its alloys with iridium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>To obtain pure platinum, the ore is treated with aqua regia in which
only the osmium and iridium are insoluble. The solution contains the
platinum metals in the form RCl<sub>4</sub>, and in the lower forms of chlorination,
RCl<sub>3</sub> and RCl<sub>2</sub>, because some of these metals&mdash;for instance,
palladium and rhodium&mdash;form such unstable chlorides of the type RX<sub>4</sub>
that they partially decompose even when diluted with water, and pass
into the stable lower type of combination; in addition to which the
chlorine is very easily disengaged if it comes in contact with substances
on which it can act. In this respect platinum resists the action of
heat and reducing agents better than any of its companions&mdash;that is,
it passes with greater difficulty from PtCl<sub>4</sub> to the lower compound
PtCl<sub>2</sub>. On this is based the method of preparation of more or less
pure platinum. Lime or sodium hydroxide is added to the solution in
aqua regia until neutralised, or only containing a very slight excess of
alkali. It is best to first evaporate and slightly ignite the solution, in
order to remove the excess of acid, and by heating it to partially convert
the higher chlorides of the palladium, &amp;c., into the lower. The
addition of alkalis completes the reduction, because the chlorine held
in the compounds RX<sub>4</sub> acts on the alkali like free chlorine, converting
it into a hypochlorite. Thus palladium chloride, PdCl<sub>4</sub>, for example,
is converted into palladious chloride, PdCl<sub>2</sub>, by this means, according
to the equation PdCl<sub>4</sub> + 2NaHO = PdCl<sub>2</sub> + NaCl + NaClO + H<sub>2</sub>O. In
a similar manner iridic chloride, IrCl<sub>4</sub>, is converted into the trichloride,
IrCl<sub>3</sub>, by this method. When this conversion takes place the platinum
still remains in the form of platinic chloride, PtCl<sub>4</sub>. It is then possible
to take advantage of a certain difference in the properties of the higher
and lower chlorides of the platinum metals. Thus lime precipitates the
lower chlorides of the members of the platinum metals occurring in
solution without acting on the platinic chloride, PtCl<sub>4</sub>, and hence the
addition of a large proportion of lime immediately precipitates the
associated metals, leaving the platinum itself in solution in the form
of a soluble double salt, PtCl<sub>4</sub>,CaCl<sub>2</sub>. A far better and more perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
<i>separation</i> is effected <i>by means of ammonium chloride</i>, which gives, with
platinic chloride, an insoluble yellow precipitate, PtCl<sub>4</sub>,2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, whilst
it forms soluble double salts with the lower chlorides RCl<sub>2</sub> and RCl<sub>3</sub>,
so that ammonium chloride precipitates the platinum only from the
solution obtained by the preceding method. These methods are
employed for preparing the platinum which is used for the manufacture
of platinum articles, because, having platinum in solution as calcium
platinochloride, PtCaCl<sub>6</sub>, or as the insoluble ammonium platinochloride,
Pt(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, the platinum compound in every case, after drying or
ignition, loses all the chlorine from the platinic chloride and leaves finely-divided
metallic platinum, which may be converted into homogeneous
metal by compression and forging, or by fusion.<a name="FNanchor_5_458" id="FNanchor_5_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_458" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Metallic <i>platinum</i> in a fused state has a specific gravity of 21; it
is grey, softer than iron but harder than copper, exceedingly ductile,
and therefore easily drawn into wire and rolled into thin sheets, and
may be hammered into crucibles and drawn into thin tubes, &amp;c. In
the state in which it is obtained by the ignition of its compounds,
it forms a spongy mass, known as spongy platinum, or else as powder
(platinum black).<a name="FNanchor_6_459" id="FNanchor_6_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_459" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In either case it is dull grey, and is characterised,
as we already know, by the faculty of absorbing hydrogen and other
gases. Platinum is not acted on by hydrochloric, hydriodic, nitric, and
sulphuric acids, or a mixture of hydrofluoric and nitric acids. Aqua
regia, and any liquid containing chlorine or able to evolve chlorine or
bromine, dissolves platinum. Alkalis are decomposed by platinum at
a red heat, owing to the faculty of the platinum oxide, PtO<sub>2</sub>, formed to
combine with alkaline bases, inasmuch as it has a feebly-developed acid
character (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_8_463">8</a>). Sulphur, phosphorus (the phosphide, PtP<sub>2</sub>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
is formed), arsenic and silicon all act more or less rapidly on platinum,
under the influence of heat. Many of the metals form alloys with it.
Even charcoal combines with platinum when it is ignited with it, and
therefore carbonaceous matter cannot be subjected to prolonged and
powerful ignition in platinum vessels. Hence a platinum crucible soon
becomes dull on the surface in a smoky flame. Platinum also forms
alloys with zinc, lead, tin, copper, gold, and silver.<a name="FNanchor_7_460" id="FNanchor_7_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_460" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Although mercury
does not directly dissolve platinum, still it forms a solution or amalgam
with spongy platinum in the presence of sodium amalgam; a similar
amalgam is also formed by the action of sodium amalgam on a solution
of platinum chloride, and is used for physical experiments.</p>

<p>There are <i>two kinds</i> of <i>platinum compounds</i>, PtX<sub>4</sub> and PtX<sub>2</sub>.
The former are produced by an excess of halogen in the cold, and the
latter by the aid of heat or by the splitting up of the former. The
starting-point for the platinum compounds is <i>platinum tetrachloride</i>,
<i>platinic chloride</i>, PtCl<sub>4</sub>, obtained by dissolving platinum in aqua
regia.<a name="FNanchor_7_BIS_461" id="FNanchor_7_BIS_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_461" class="fnanchor">[7 bis]</a> The solution crystallises in the cold, in a desiccator, in the
form of reddish-brown deliquescent crystals which contain hydrochloric
acid, PtCl<sub>4</sub>,2HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O, and behave like a true acid whose salts correspond
to the formula R<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>&mdash;ammonium platinochloride, for
example.<a name="FNanchor_7_TRI_462" id="FNanchor_7_TRI_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_TRI_462" class="fnanchor">[7 tri]</a> The hydrochloric acid is liberated from these crystals by
gently heating or evaporating the solution to dryness; or, better still,
after treatment with silver nitrate a reddish-brown mass remains
behind, which dissolves in water, and forms a yellowish-red solution
which on cooling deposits crystals of the composition PtCl<sub>4</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O.
The <i>tendency</i> of PtCl<sub>4</sub> <i>to combine</i> with hydrochloric acid and water&mdash;that
is, <i>to form higher crystalline compounds</i>&mdash;is evident in the
platinum compounds, and must be taken into account in explaining
the properties of platinum and the formation of many other of its
complex compounds. Dilute solutions of platinic chloride are yellow,
and are completely reduced by hydrogen, sulphurous anhydride, and
many reducing agents, which first convert the platinic chloride into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the lower compound platinous chloride, PtCl<sub>2</sub>. That faculty which
reveals itself in platinum tetrachloride of combining with water of
crystallisation and hydrochloric acid is distinctly marked in its property,
with which we are already acquainted, of giving precipitates
with the salts of potassium, ammonium, rubidium, &amp;c. In general it
<i>readily forms double salts</i>, R<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> = PtCl<sub>4</sub> + 2RCl, where R is a
univalent metal such as potassium or NH<sub>4</sub>. Hence the addition of a
solution of potassium or ammonium chloride to a solution of platinic
chloride is followed by the formation of a yellow precipitate, which is
sparingly soluble in water and almost entirely insoluble in alcohol and
ether (platinic chloride is soluble in alcohol, potassium iridiochloride,
IrK<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, <i>i.e.</i> a compound of IrCl<sub>3</sub>, is soluble in water but not in alcohol).
It is especially remarkable in this case, that the potassium compounds
here, as in a number of other instances, separate in an anhydrous form,
whilst the sodium compounds, which are soluble in water and alcohol,
form red crystals containing water. The composition Na<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O
exactly corresponds with the above-mentioned hydrochloric compound.
The compounds with barium, BaPtCl<sub>6</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, strontium, SrPtCl<sub>6</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O,
calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese, and many other metals are all
soluble in water.<a name="FNanchor_8_463" id="FNanchor_8_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_463" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Platinous chloride</i>, PtCl<sub>2</sub>, is formed when hydrogen platinochloride,
PtH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, is ignited at 300°, or when potassium is heated at 230° in a
stream of chlorine. The undecomposed tetrachloride is extracted from
the residue by washing it with water, and a greenish-grey or brown
insoluble mass of the dichloride (sp. gr. 5·9) is then obtained. It is
soluble in hydrochloric acid, giving an acid solution of the composition
PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2HCl, corresponding with the type of double salts PtR<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>.
Although platinous chloride decomposes below 500°, still it is formed to
a small extent at higher temperatures. Troost and Hautefeuille, and
Seelheim observed that when platinum was strongly ignited in a stream of
chlorine, the metal, as it were, slowly volatilised and was deposited in
crystals; a volatile chloride, probably platinous chloride, was evidently
formed in this case, and decomposed subsequently to its formation,
depositing crystals of platinum.</p>

<p>The properties of platinum above-described are repeated more or less
distinctly, or sometimes with certain modifications, in the above-mentioned
associates and analogues of this metal. Thus although palladium
forms PdCl<sub>4</sub>, this form passes into PdCl<sub>2</sub> with extreme ease.<a name="FNanchor_9_464" id="FNanchor_9_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_464" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a><br /><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a><br /><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
rhodium and iridium in dissolving in aqua regia also form RhCl<sub>4</sub> and
IrCl<sub>4</sub>, but they pass into RhCl<sub>3</sub> and IrCl<sub>3</sub><a name="FNanchor_9_BIS_465" id="FNanchor_9_BIS_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_BIS_465" class="fnanchor">[9 bis]</a> very easily when heated
or when acted upon by substances capable of taking up chlorine (even
alkalis, which form bleaching salts). Among the platinum metals,
ruthenium and osmium have the most acid character, and although they
give RuCl<sub>4</sub> and OsCl<sub>4</sub> they are easily oxidised to RuO<sub>4</sub>, and OsO<sub>4</sub> by
the action of chlorine in the presence of water; the latter are volatile
and may be distilled with the water and hydrochloric acid, from a
solution containing other platinum metals.<a name="FNanchor_9_TRI_466" id="FNanchor_9_TRI_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_TRI_466" class="fnanchor">[9 tri]</a> Thus with respect to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
the types of combination, all the platinum metals, under certain circumstances,
give compounds of the type RX<sub>4</sub>&mdash;for instance, RO<sub>2</sub>, RCl<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
But this is the highest form for only platinum and palladium.
The remaining platinum metals further, <i>like iron, give acids</i> of the type<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
RO<sub>3</sub> or hydrates, H<sub>2</sub>RO<sub>4</sub> = RO<sub>2</sub>(HO)<sub>2</sub> (the type of sulphuric acid); but
they, like ferric and manganic acids, are chiefly known in the form of
salts of the composition K<sub>2</sub>RO<sub>4</sub> or K<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> (like the dichromate). These
salts are obtained, like the manganates and ferrates, by fusing the oxides,
or even the metals themselves, with nitric, or, better still, with potassium
peroxide. They are soluble in water, are easily deoxidised and do not
yield the acid anhydrides under the action of acids, but break up, either
(like the ferrate) forming oxygen and a basic oxide (iridium and rhodium
react in this manner, as they do not give higher forms of oxidation), or
passing into a lower and higher form of oxidation&mdash;that is, reacting
like a manganate (or partly like nitrite or phosphite). Osmium and
ruthenium react according to the latter form, as they are capable of
giving <i>higher forms of oxidation</i>, OsO<sub>4</sub> and RuO<sub>4</sub>, and therefore their
reactions of decomposition may be essentially represented by the equation:
2OsO<sub>3</sub> = OsO<sub>2</sub> + OsO<sub>4</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_10_467" id="FNanchor_10_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_467" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p>Platinum and its analogues, like iron and its analogues, are able to
form complex and comparatively stable cyanogen and ammonia compounds,
corresponding with the ferrocyanides and the ammoniacal compounds
of cobalt, which we have already considered in the preceding
chapter.</p>

<p>If platinous chloride, PtCl<sub>2</sub> (insoluble in water), be added by degrees
to a solution of potassium cyanide, it is completely dissolved (like
silver chloride), and on evaporating the solution deposits rhombic
prisms of <i>potassium platinocyanide</i>, PtK<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. This salt, like
all those corresponding with it, has a remarkable play of colours, due to
the phenomena of dichromism, and even polychromism, natural to all
the platinocyanides. Thus it is yellow and reflects a bright blue
light. It is easily soluble in water, effloresces in air, then turns red,
and at 100° orange, when it loses all its water. The loss of water
does not destroy its stability&mdash;that is, it still remains unchanged, and
its stability is further shown by the fact that it is formed when
potassium ferrocyanide, K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>, is heated with platinum black.
This salt, first obtained by Gmelin, shows a neutral reaction with
litmus; it is exceedingly stable under the action of air, like potassium
ferrocyanide, which it resembles in many respects. Thus the platinum
in it cannot be detected by reagents such as sulphuretted hydrogen;
the potassium may be replaced by other metals by the action of their
salts, so that it corresponds with a whole series of compounds, R<sub>2</sub>Pt(CN)<sub>4</sub>,
and it is stable, although the potassium cyanide and platinous salts, of
which it is composed, individually easily undergo change. When
treated with oxidising agents it passes, like the ferrocyanide, into a
higher form of combination of platinum. If salts of silver be added
to its solution, it gives a heavy white precipitate of silver platinocyanide,
PtAg<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>, which when suspended in water and treated
with sulphuretted hydrogen, enters into double decomposition with the
latter and forms insoluble silver sulphide, Ag<sub>2</sub>S, and soluble <i>hydroplatinocyanic
acid</i>, H<sub>2</sub>Pt(CN)<sub>4</sub>. If potassium platinocyanide be mixed
with an equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid, the hydroplatinocyanic
acid liberated may be extracted by a mixture of alcohol and
ether. The ethereal solution, when evaporated in a desiccator, deposits
bright red crystals of the composition PtH<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O. This acid
colours litmus paper, liberates carbonic anhydride from sodium carbonate,
and saturates alkalis, so that it presents an analogy to hydroferrocyanic
acid.<a name="FNanchor_11_468" id="FNanchor_11_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_468" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Ammonia, like potassium cyanide, has the faculty of easily reacting
with platinum dichloride, forming compounds similar to the platinocyanide
and cobaltia compounds, which are comparatively stable. But
as ammonia does not contain any hydrogen easily replaceable by
metals, and as ammonia itself is able to combine with acids, the
PtX<sub>2</sub> plays, as it were, the part of an acid with reference to the
ammonia. Owing to the influence of the ammonia, the X<sub>2</sub> in the
resultant compound will represent the same character as it has in
ammoniacal salts; consequently, the ammoniacal compounds produced
from PtX<sub>2</sub> will be salts in which X will be replaceable by various
other haloids, just as the metal is replaced in the cyanogen salts; such
is the nature of the <i>platino-ammonium compounds</i>. PtX<sub>2</sub> forms compounds
with 2NH<sub>3</sub> and with 4NH<sub>3</sub>, and so also PtX<sub>4</sub> gives (not
directly from PtX<sub>4</sub> and ammonia, but from the compounds of PtX<sub>2</sub> by
the action of chlorine, &amp;c.) similar compounds with 2NH<sub>3</sub> and with
4NH<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_12_469" id="FNanchor_12_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_469" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>If ammonia acts on a boiling solution of platinous chloride in
hydrochloric acid, it produces the green <i>salt of Magnus</i> (1829),
PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, insoluble in water and hydrochloric acid. But, judging
by its reactions, this salt has twice this formula. Thus, Gros (1837),
on boiling Magnus's salt with nitric acid, observed that half the chlorine
was replaced by the residue of nitric acid and half the platinum was
disengaged: 2PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2HNO<sub>3</sub> = PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub> + 2PtCl<sub>2</sub>.
The Gros's salt thus obtained, PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>4NH<sub>3</sub> (if Magnus's salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
belongs to the type PtX<sub>2</sub>, then Gros's salt belongs to the type PtX<sub>4</sub>), is
soluble in water, and the elements of nitric acid, but not the chlorine,
contained in it are capable of easily submitting themselves to double
saline decomposition. Thus silver nitrate does not enter into double
decomposition with the chlorine of Gros's salt. Most instructive was
the circumstance that Gros, by acting on his salt with hydrochloric
acid, succeeded in substituting the residue of nitric acid in it by
chlorine, and the chlorine thus introduced, easily reacted with silver
nitrate. Thus it appeared that Gros's salt contained two varieties of
chlorine&mdash;one which reacts readily, and the other which reacts with
difficulty. The composition of Gros's first salt is PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>;
it may be converted into PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>), and in general into
PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>X<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_13_470" id="FNanchor_13_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_470" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The salt of Magnus when boiled with a solution of ammonia gives
the salt (of Reiset's first base) PtCl<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, and this, when treated
with bromine, forms the salt PtCl<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, which has the same
composition and reactions as Gros's salt. To Reiset's salts there
corresponds a soluble, colourless, crystalline <i>hydroxide</i>, Pt(OH)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>,
having the properties of a powerful and very energetic <i>alkali</i>; it
attracts carbonic anhydride from the atmosphere, precipitates metallic
salts like potash, saturates active acids, even sulphuric, forming
colourless (with nitric, carbonic, and hydrochloric acids), or yellow
(with sulphuric acid), salts of the type PtX<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_14_471" id="FNanchor_14_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_471" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>

to them, endows them with a particular chemical interest. Thus
Kournakoff (1889) obtained a series of corresponding compounds containing
thiocarbamide, CSN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, in the place of ammonia, PtCl<sub>2</sub>,4CSN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,
and others corresponding with Reiset's salts. Hydroxylamine, and
other substances corresponding with ammonia, also give similar compounds.
The common properties and composition of such compounds
show their entire analogy to the cobaltia compounds (especially for
ruthenium and iridium) and correspond to the fact that both the
platinum metals and cobalt occur in the same, eighth, group.</p>

decompose by Thomsen's data, showing that in an excess of water (+ Aq) the formation
from platinum, of such a double salt as PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2KCl, is accompanied by a comparatively
small evolution of heat (<i>see</i> Chapter XXI., Note <a href="#Footnote_40_451">40</a>), for instance, Pt + Cl<sub>2</sub> + 2KCl + Aq
only evolves about 33,000 calories (hence the reaction, Pt + Cl<sub>2</sub> + Aq, will evidently
disengage still less, because PtCl<sub>2</sub> + 2KCl evolves a certain amount of heat), whilst on

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_454" id="Footnote_2_454"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_454"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The largest amount of platinum is extracted in the Urals, about five tons annually.
A certain amount of gold is extracted from the washed platinum by means of mercury,
which does not dissolve the platinum metals but dissolves the gold accompanying the
platinum in its ores. Moreover, the ores of platinum always contain metals of the iron
series associated with them. The washed and mechanically sorted ore in the majority
of cases contains about 70 to 80 p.c. of platinum, about 5 to 8 p.c. of iridium, and a somewhat
smaller quantity of osmium. The other platinum metals&mdash;palladium, rhodium, and
ruthenium&mdash;occur in smaller proportions than the three above named. Sometimes grains
of almost pure osmium-iridium, containing only a small quantity of other metals, are
found in platinum ores. This <i>osmium-iridium</i> may be easily separated from the other
platinum metals, owing to its being nearly insoluble in aqua regia, by which the latter
are easily dissolved. There are grains of platinum which are magnetic. The grains of
osmium-iridium are very hard and malleable, and are therefore used for certain purposes,
for instance, for the tips of gold pens.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_455" id="Footnote_3_455"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_455"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In characterising the platinum metals according to their relation to the iron metals,
it is very important to add two more very remarkable points. The platinum metals are
capable of forming a sort of unstable compound with <i>hydrogen</i>; they absorb it and only
part with it when somewhat strongly heated. This faculty is especially developed in
platinum and palladium, and it is very characteristic that nickel, which exactly corresponds
with platinum and palladium in the periodic system, should exhibit the same faculty for
retaining a considerable quantity of hydrogen (Graham's and Raoult's experiments).
Another characteristic property of the platinum metals consists in their easily giving
(like cobalt which forms the cobaltic salts) stable and characteristic saline <i>compounds
with ammonia</i>, and like Fe and Co, double salts with the cyanides of the alkali metals,
especially in their lower forms of combination. All the above so clearly brings the
elements of the iron series in close relation to the platinum metals, that the eighth group
acquires as natural a character as can be required, with a certain originality or individuality
for each element.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_BIS_456" id="Footnote_3_BIS_456"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_BIS_456"><span class="label">[3 bis]</span></a> Platinum was first obtained in the last century from Brazil, where it was called
silver (platinus). Watson in 1750 characterised platinum as a separate independent
metal. In 1803 Wollaston discovered palladium and rhodium in crude platinum, and at
about the same time Tennant distinguished iridium and osmium in it. Professor Claus,
of Kazan, in his researches on the platinum metals (about 1840) discovered ruthenium
in them, and to him are due many important discoveries with regard to these elements,
such as the indication of the remarkable analogy between the series Pd&mdash;Rh&mdash;Ru and
Pt&mdash;Ir&mdash;Os.</p>

<p><i>The treatment of platinum ore</i> is chiefly carried on for the extraction of the platinum
itself and its alloys with iridium, because these metals offer a greater resistance to the
action of chemical reagents and high temperatures than any of the other malleable and
ductile metals, and therefore the wire so often used in the laboratory and for technical
purposes is made from them, as also are various vessels used for chemical purposes in
the laboratory and in works. Thus sulphuric acid is distilled in platinum retorts, and
many substances are fused, ignited, and evaporated in the laboratory in platinum
crucibles and on platinum foil. Gold and many other substances are dissolved in dishes
made of iridium-platinum, because the alloys of platinum and iridium are but slightly
attacked when subjected to the action of aqua regia.</p>

<p>The comparatively high density (about 21·5), hardness, ductility, and infusibility (it
does not melt at a furnace heat, but only in the oxyhydrogen flame or electric furnace),
as well as the fact of its resisting the action of water, air, and other reagents, renders an
alloy of 90 parts of platinum and 10 parts of iridium (Deville's platinum-iridium alloy) a
most valuable material for making standard weights and measures, such as the metre,
kilogram, and pound, and therefore all the newest standards of most countries are made
of this alloy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_457" id="Footnote_4_457"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_457"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This process has altered the technical treatment of platinum to a considerable
extent. It has in particular facilitated the manufacture of alloys of platinum with
iridium and rhodium from the pure platinum ores, since it is sufficient to fuse the
ore in order for the greater amount of the osmium to burn off, and for the mass to fuse
into a homogeneous, malleable alloy, which can be directly made use of. There is very
little ruthenium in the ores of platinum. If during fusion lead be added, it dissolves
the platinum (and other platinum metals) owing to its being able to form a very characteristic
alloy containing PtPb. If an alloy of the two metals be left exposed to moist
air, the excess of lead is converted into carbonate (white lead) in the presence of the
water and carbonic acid of the air, whilst the above platinum alloy remains unchanged.
The white lead may be extracted by dilute acid, and the alloy PtPb remains unaltered.
The other platinum metals also give similar alloys with lead. The fusibility of these
alloys enables the platinum metals to be separated from the gangue of the ore, and they
may afterwards be separated from the lead by subjecting the alloy to oxidation in
furnaces furnished with a bone ash bed, because the lead is then oxidised and absorbed
by the bone ash, leaving the platinum metals untouched. This method of treatment
was proposed by H. Sainte-Claire Deville in the sixties, and is also used in the analysis of
these metals (<i>see</i> further on).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_458" id="Footnote_5_458"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_458"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> For the ultimate purification of platinum from palladium and iridium the metals
must be re-dissolved in aqua regia, and the solution evaporated until the residue begins
to evolve chlorine. The residue is then re-precipitated with ammonium or potassium
chloride. The precipitate may still contain a certain amount of iridium, which passes
with greater difficulty from the tetrachloride, IrCl<sub>4</sub>, into the trichloride, IrCl<sub>3</sub>, but it will
be quite free from palladium, because the latter easily loses its chlorine and passes into
palladious chloride, PdCl<sub>2</sub>, which gives an easily-soluble salt with potassium chloride.
The precipitate, containing a small quantity of iridium, is then heated with sodium
carbonate in a crucible, when the mass decomposes, giving metallic platinum and
iridium oxide. If potassium chloride has been employed, the residue after ignition is
washed with water and treated with aqua regia. The iridium oxide remains undissolved,
and the platinum easily passes into solution. Only cold and dilute aqua regia must be
used. The solution will then contain pure platinic chloride, which forms the starting-point
for the preparation of all platinum compounds. Pure platinum for accurate
researches (for instance, for the unit of light, according to Violle's method) may be
obtained (Mylius and Foerster, 1892) by Finkener's method, by dissolving the impure
metal in aqua regia (it should be evaporated to drive off the nitrogen compounds), and
adding NaCl so as to form a double sodium salt, which is purified by crystallising with a
small amount of caustic soda, washing the crystals with a strong solution of NaCl, and
then dissolving them in a hot 1 p.c. solution of soda, repeating the above and ultimately
igniting the double salt, previously dried at 120°, in a stream of hydrogen; platinum
black and NaCl are then formed. The three following are very sensitive tests (to
thousandths of a per cent.) for the presence of Ir, Ru, Rh, Pd (osmium is not usually
present in platinum which has once been purified, since it easily volatilises with Cl<sub>2</sub>
and CO<sub>2</sub>, and in the first treatment of the crude platinum either passes off as OsO<sub>4</sub>
or remains undissolved), Fe, Cu, Ag, and Pb: (1) the assay is alloyed with 10 parts of
pure lead, the alloy treated with dilute nitric acid (to remove the greater part of the
Pb), and dissolved in aqua regia; the residue will consist of Ir and Ru; the Pb is
precipitated from the nitric acid solution by sulphuric acid, whilst the remaining
platinum metals are reduced from the evaporated solution by formic acid, and the
resultant precipitate fused with KHSO<sub>4</sub>; the Pd and Rh are thus converted into soluble
salts, and the former is then precipitated by HgC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. (2) Iron may be detected by the
usual reagents, if the crude platinum be dissolved in aqua regia, and the platinum
metals precipitated from the solution by formic acid. (3) If crude platinum (as foil or
sponge) be heated in a mixture of chlorine and carbonic oxide it volatilises (with a
certain amount of Ir, Pd, Fe, &amp;c.) as PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2CO (Note <a href="#Footnote_11_468">11</a>), whilst the whole of the Rh,
Ag, and Cu it may contain remains behind. Among other characteristic reactions for
the platinum metals, we may mention: (1) that rhodium is precipitated from the solution
obtained after fusion with KHSO<sub>4</sub> (in which Pt does not dissolve) by NH<sub>3</sub>, acetic and
formic acids; (2) that dilute aqua regia dissolves precipitated Pt, but not Rh; (3) that
if the insoluble residue of the platinum metals (Ir, Ru, Os) obtained, after treating with
aqua regia, be fused with a mixture of 1 part of KNO<sub>3</sub> and 3 parts of K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (in a gold
crucible), and then treated with water, it gives a solution containing the Ru (and a
portion of the Ir), but which throws it all down when saturated with chlorine and
boiled; (4) that if iridium be fused with a mixture of KHO and KNO<sub>3</sub>, it gives a soluble
potassium salt, IrK<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (the solution is blue), which, when saturated with chlorine, gives
IrCl<sub>4</sub>, which is precipitated by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (the precipitate is black), forming a double salt,
leaving metallic Ir after ignition; (5) that rhodium mixed with NaCl and ignited in a
current of chlorine gives a soluble double salt (from which sal-ammoniac separates Pt
and Ir), which gives (according to Jörgensen) a difficultly soluble purpureo-salt (Chapter
XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_35_445">35</a>), Rh<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, when treated with NH<sub>3</sub>; in this form the Rh may be
easily purified and obtained in a metallic form by igniting in hydrogen; and (6) that
palladium, dissolved in aqua regia and dried (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl throws down any Pt), gives soluble
PdCl<sub>2</sub>, which forms an easily crystallisable yellow salt, PdCl<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>, with ammonia; this
salt (Wilm) may be easily purified by crystallisation, and gives metallic Pd when
ignited. These reactions illustrate the method of separating the platinum metals from
each other.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_459" id="Footnote_6_459"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_459"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> We have already become acquainted with the effect of finely-divided platinum on
many gaseous substances. It is best seen in the so-called <i>platinum black</i>, which is a
coal-black powder left by the action of sulphuric acid on the alloy of zinc and platinum,
or which is precipitated by metallic zinc from a dilute solution of platinum. In any
case, finely-divided platinum absorbs gases more powerfully and rapidly the more
finely divided and porous it is. Sulphurous anhydride, hydrogen, alcohol, and many
organic substances in the presence of such platinum are easily oxidised by the oxygen of
the air, although they do not combine with it directly. The absorption of oxygen is as
much as several hundred volumes per one volume of platinum, and the oxidising power
of such absorbed oxygen is taken advantage of not only in the laboratory but even in
manufacturing processes. Asbestos or charcoal, soaked in a solution of platinic chloride
and ignited, is very useful for this purpose, because by this means it becomes coated with
platinum black. If 50 grams of PtCl<sub>4</sub> be dissolved in 60 c.c. of water, and 70 c.c. of a
strong (40 p.c.) solution of formic aldehyde added, the mixture cooled, and then a
solution of 50 grams of NaHO in 50 grams of water added, the platinum is precipitated.
After washing with water the precipitate passes into solution and forms a
black liquid containing <i>soluble colloidal platinum</i> (Loew, 1890). If the precipitated
platinum be allowed to absorb oxygen on the filter, the temperature rises 40°, and a
very porous <i>platinum black</i> is obtained which vigorously facilitates oxidation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_460" id="Footnote_7_460"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_460"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> It is necessary to remark that platinum when alloyed with silver, or as amalgam,
is soluble in nitric acid, and in this respect it differs from gold, so that it is possible,
by alloying gold with silver, and acting on the alloy with nitric acid, to recognise
the presence of platinum in the gold, because nitric acid does not act on gold alloyed
with silver.</p></div>

the action of gaseous chlorine upon platinum.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_TRI_462" id="Footnote_7_TRI_462"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_TRI_462"><span class="label">[7 tri]</span></a> Pigeon (1891) obtained fine yellow crystals of PtH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O by adding strong sulphuric
acid to a strong solution of PtH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O. If crystals of H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O be
melted in vacuo (60°) in the presence of anhydrous potash, a red-brown solid hydrate is
obtained containing less water and HCl, which parts with the remainder at 200°, leaving
anhydrous PtCl<sub>4</sub>. The latter does not disengage chlorine before 220°, and is perfectly
soluble in water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_463" id="Footnote_8_463"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_463"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Nilson (1877), who investigated the platinochlorides of various metals subsequently
to Bonsdorff, Topsöe, Clève, Marignac, and others, found that univalent and bivalent
metals&mdash;such as hydrogen, potassium, ammonium &hellip; beryllium, calcium, barium&mdash;give
compounds of such a composition that there is always twice as much chlorine in
the platinic chloride as in the combined metallic chloride; for example, K<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,PtCl<sub>4</sub>;
BeCl<sub>2</sub>,PtCl<sub>4</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c. Such trivalent metals as aluminium, iron (ferric), chromium, didymium,
cerium (cerous) form compounds of the type RCl<sub>3</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub>, in which the amounts of
chlorine are in the ratio 3:4. Only indium and yttrium give salts of a different composition&mdash;namely,
2InCl<sub>3</sub>,5PtCl<sub>4</sub>,36H<sub>2</sub>O and 4YCl<sub>3</sub>,5PtCl<sub>4</sub>,51H<sub>2</sub>O. Such quadrivalent metals
as thorium, tin, zirconium give compounds of the type RCl<sub>4</sub>,PtCl<sub>4</sub>, in which the ratio of
the chlorine is 1:1. In this manner the valency of a metal may, to a certain extent, be
judged from the composition of the double salts formed with platinic chloride.</p>

<p>Platinic bromide, PtBr<sub>4</sub>, and iodide, PtI<sub>4</sub>, are analogous to the tetrachloride, but the
iodide is decomposed still more easily than the chloride. If sulphuric acid be added to
platinic chloride, and the solution evaporated, it forms a black porous mass like charcoal,
which deliquesces in the air, and has the composition Pt(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. But this, the
only oxygen salt of the type PtX<sub>4</sub>, is exceedingly unstable. This is due to the fact that
<i>platinum oxide</i>, the oxide of the type PtO<sub>2</sub>, has a feeble acid character. This is shown
in a number of instances. Thus if a strong solution of platinic chloride treated with
sodium carbonate be exposed to the action of light or evaporated to dryness and then
washed with water, a sodium platinate, Pt<sub>3</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, remains. The composition of
this salt, if we regard it in the same sense as we did the salts of silicic, titanic, molybdic
and other acids, will be PtO(ONa)<sub>2</sub>,2PtO<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;that is, the same type is repeated as
we saw in the crystalline compounds of platinum tetrachloride with sodium chloride, or
with hydrochloric acid&mdash;namely, the type PtX<sub>4</sub>8Y, where Y is the molecule H<sub>2</sub>O,HCl, &amp;c.
Similar compounds are also obtained with other alkalis. They will be platinates of the
alkalis in which the platinic oxide, PtO<sub>2</sub>, plays the part of an acid oxide. Rousseau
(1889) obtained different grades of combination BaOPtO<sub>2</sub>, 3(BaO)2PtO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., by igniting
a mixture of PtCl<sub>4</sub> and caustic baryta. If such an alkaline compound of platinum be
treated with acetic acid, the alkali combines with the latter, and a <i>platinic hydroxide</i>,
Pt(OH)<sub>4</sub>, remains as a brown mass, which loses water and oxygen when ignited, and in
so doing decomposes with a slight explosion. When slightly ignited this hydroxide first
loses water and gives the very unstable oxide PtO<sub>2</sub>. Platinic sulphide, PtS<sub>2</sub>, belongs to
the same type; it is precipitated by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen on a solution
of platinum tetrachloride. The moist precipitate is capable of attracting oxygen, and is
then converted into the sulphate above mentioned, which is soluble in water. This
absorption of oxygen and conversion into sulphate is another illustration of the basic
nature of PtO<sub>2</sub>, so that it clearly exhibits both basic and acid properties. The latter
appear, for instance, in the fact that platinic sulphide, PtS<sub>2</sub>, gives crystalline compounds
with the alkali sulphides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_464" id="Footnote_9_464"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_464"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> In comparing the characteristics of the platinum metals, it must be observed that
palladium in its form of combination PdX<sub>2</sub> gives saline compounds of considerable
stability. Amongst them <i>palladous chloride</i> is formed by the direct action of chlorine
or aqua regia (not in excess or in dilute solutions) on palladium. It forms a brown
solution, which gives a black insoluble precipitate of <i>palladous iodide</i>, PdI<sub>2</sub>, with
solutions of iodides (in this respect, as in many others, palladium resembles mercury in
the mercuric compounds HgX<sub>2</sub>). With a solution of mercuric cyanide it gives a yellowish
white precipitate, palladous cyanide, PdC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, which is soluble in potassium cyanide, and
gives other double salts, M<sub>2</sub>PdC<sub>4</sub>N<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>That portion of the platinum ore which dissolves in aqua regia and is precipitated
by ammonium or potassium chloride does not contain palladium. It remains in solution,
because the palladic chloride, PdCl<sub>4</sub>, is decomposed and the palladous chloride
formed is not precipitated by ammonium chloride; the same holds good for all the other
lower chlorides of the platinum metals. Zinc (and iron) separates out all the unprecipitated
platinum metals (and also copper, &amp;c.) from the solution. The palladium is found
in these platinum residues precipitated by zinc. If this mixture of metals be treated
with aqua regia, all the palladium will pass into solution as palladous chloride with
some platinic chloride. By this treatment the main portion of the iridium, rhodium, &amp;c.
remains almost undissolved, the platinum is separated from the mixture of palladous
and platinic chlorides by a solution of ammonium chloride, and the solution of palladium
is precipitated by potassium iodide or mercuric cyanide. Wilm (1881) showed that
palladium may be separated from an impure solution by saturating it with ammonia; all
the iron present is thus precipitated, and, after filtering, the addition of hydrochloric
acid to the filtrate gives a yellow precipitate of an ammonio-palladium compound,
PdCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, whilst nearly all the other metals remain in solution. <i>Metallic palladium</i>
is obtained by igniting the ammonio-compound or the cyanide, PdC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. It occurs
native, although rarely, and is a metal of a whiter colour than platinum, sp. gr. 11·4,
melts at about 1,500°; it is much more volatile than platinum, partially oxidises on the
surface when heated (Wilm obtained spongy palladium by igniting PdCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, and
observed that it gives PdO when ignited in oxygen, and that on further ignition this
oxide forms a mixture of Pd<sub>2</sub>O and Pd), and loses its absorbed oxygen on a further rise
of temperature. It does not blacken or tarnish (does not absorb sulphur) in the air at
the ordinary temperature, and is therefore better suited than silver for astronomical and
other instruments in which fine divisions have to be engraved on a white metal, in order
that the fine lines should be clearly visible. The most remarkable property of palladium,
discovered by Graham, consists in its capacity for <i>absorbing</i> a large amount of <i>hydrogen</i>.
Ignited palladium absorbs as much as 940 volumes of hydrogen, or about 0·7 p.c. of its
own weight, which closely approaches to the formation of the compound Pd<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, and
probably indicates the formation of <i>palladium hydride</i>, Pd<sub>2</sub>H. This absorption
also takes place at the ordinary temperature&mdash;for example, when palladium serves as
an electrode at which hydrogen is evolved. In absorbing the hydrogen, the palladium
does not change in appearance, and retains all its metallic properties, only its volume
increases by about 10 p.c.&mdash;that is, the hydrogen pushes out and separates the atoms of
the palladium from each other, and is itself compressed to <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>900</sub> of its volume. This compression
indicates a great force of chemical attraction, and is accompanied by the evolution
of heat (Chapter II., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_38_162">38</a>). The absorption of 1 grm. of hydrogen by metallic
palladium (Favre) is accompanied by the evolution of 4·2 thousand calories (for Pt 20,
for Na 13, for K 10 thousand units of heat). Troost showed that the dissociation
pressure of palladium hydride is inconsiderable at the ordinary temperature, but reaches
the atmospheric pressure at about 140°. This subject was subsequently investigated by
A. A. Cracow of St. Petersburg (1894), who showed that at first the absorption of
hydrogen by the palladium proceeds like solution, according to the law of Dalton and
Henry, but that towards the end it proceeds like a dissociation phenomenon in definite
compounds; this forms another link between the phenomenon of solution and of the
formation of definite atomic compounds. Cracow's observations for a temperature 18°,
showed that the electro-conductivity and tension vary until a compound Pd<sub>2</sub>H is reached,
and namely, that the tension <i>p</i> rises with the volume <i>v</i> of hydrogen absorbed, according
to the law of Dalton and Henry&mdash;for instance, for</p>

<p class="noindent">The maximum tension at 18° is 9 mm. At a temperature of about 140° (in the vapour of
xylene) the maximum tension is about 760 mm., and when <i>v</i> = 10&ndash;50 vols. the tension
(according to Cracow's experiments) stands at 90&ndash;450 mm.&mdash;that is, increases in proportion
to the volume of hydrogen absorbed. But from the point of view of chemical
mechanics it is especially important to remark that Moutier clearly showed, through
palladium hydride, the similarity of the phenomena which proceed in evaporation and
dissociation, which fact Henri Sainte-Claire Deville placed as a fundamental proposition
in the theory of dissociation. It is possible upon the basis of the second law of the
theory of heat, according to the law of the variation of the tension <i>p</i> of evaporation with
the temperature T (counted from -273°), to calculate the latent heat of evaporation
L (<i>see</i> works on physics) because 424L = T(&#8543;<i>d</i> - &#8543;/D)<i>dp</i>/<i>dt</i>, where <i>d</i> and D are the
weights of cubic measures of the gas (vapour) and liquid. (Thus, for instance, for

whence 424L = 227,264, and the second portion of the equation 226,144, which is
sufficiently near, within the limits of experimental error, <i>see</i> Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_11_57">11</a>.)
The same equation is applicable to the dissociation of Na<sub>2</sub>H and K<sub>2</sub>H&mdash;(Chapter XII.,
Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_42_764">42</a>)&mdash;but it has only been verified in this respect for Pd<sub>2</sub>H, since Moutier, by
calculating the amount of heat L evolved, for <i>t</i> = 20, according to the variation of
the tension (<i>dp</i>/<i>dt</i>) obtained 4·1 thousand calories, which is very near the figure
obtained experimentally by Favre (<i>see</i> Chapter XII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_44_767">44</a>). The absorbed hydrogen
is easily disengaged by ignition or decreased pressure. The resultant compound
does not decompose at the ordinary temperature, but when exposed to air the metal
sometimes glows spontaneously, owing to the hydrogen burning at the expense of
the atmospheric oxygen. The hydrogen absorbed by palladium acts towards many
solutions as a reducing agent; in a word, everything here points to the formation of a
definite compound and at the same time of a physically-compressed gas, and forms one
of the best examples of the bond existing between chemical and physical processes, to
which we have many times drawn attention. It must be again remembered that the
other metals of the eighth group, even copper, are, like palladium and platinum, able to
combine with hydrogen. The permeability of iron and platinum tubes to hydrogen is
naturally due to the formation of similar compounds, but palladium is the most
permeable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_BIS_465" id="Footnote_9_BIS_465"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_BIS_465"><span class="label">[9 bis]</span></a> <i>Rhodium</i> is generally separated, together with iridium, from the residues left
after the treatment of native platinum, because the palladium is entirely separated from
them, and the ruthenium is present in them in very small traces, whilst the osmium at
any rate is easily separated, as we shall soon see. The mixture of rhodium and iridium
which is left undissolved in dilute aqua regia is dissolved in chlorine water, or by the
action of chlorine on a mixture of the metals with sodium chloride. In either case both
metals pass into solution. They may be separated by many methods. In either case
(if the action be aided by heat) the rhodium is obtained in the form of the chloride
RhCl<sub>3</sub>, and the iridium as iridious chloride, IrCl<sub>3</sub>. They both form double salts with
sodium chloride which are soluble in water, but the iridium salt is also partially soluble
in alcohol, whilst the rhodium salt is not. A mixture of the chlorides, when treated with
dilute aqua regia, gives iridic chloride, IrCl<sub>4</sub>, whilst the rhodium chloride, RhCl<sub>3</sub>, remains
unaltered; ammonium chloride then precipitates the iridium as ammonium iridiochloride,
Ir(NH<sub>4</sub>)2Cl<sub>6</sub>, and on evaporating the rose-coloured filtrate the rhodium gives
a crystalline salt, Rh(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>. Rhodium and its various oxides are dissolved when
fused with potassium hydrogen sulphate, and give a soluble double sulphate (whilst
iridium remains unacted on); this fact is very characteristic for this metal, which offers
in its properties many points of resemblance with the iron metals. When fused with
potassium hydroxide and chlorate it is oxidised like iridium, but it is not afterwards
soluble in water, in which respect it differs from ruthenium. This is taken advantage of for
separating rhodium, ruthenium, and iridium. In any case, rhodium under ordinary
conditions always gives salts of the type RX<sub>3</sub>, and not of any other type; and not only
halogen salts, but also oxygen salts, are known in this type, which is rare among
the platinum metals. Rhodium chloride, RhCl<sub>3</sub>, is known in an insoluble anhydrous
and also in a soluble form (like CrX<sub>3</sub> or salts of chromic oxides), in which it easily gives
double salts, compounds with water of crystallisation, and forms rose-coloured solutions.
In this form rhodium easily gives double salts of the two types RhM<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> and RhM<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;for
example, K<sub>5</sub>RhCl<sub>6</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O and K<sub>2</sub>RhCl<sub>5</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. Solutions of the salts (at least, the
ammonium salt) of the first kind give salts of the second kind when they are boiled. If
a strong solution of potash be added to a red solution of rhodium chloride and boiled, a
black precipitate of the hydroxide Rh(OH)<sub>3</sub> is formed; but if the solution of potash is
added little by little, it gives a yellow precipitate containing more water. This yellow
hydrate of rhodium oxide gives a yellow solution when it is dissolved in acids, which
only becomes rose-coloured after being boiled. It is obvious a change here takes place,
like the transmutations of the salts of chromic oxide. It is also a remarkable fact that
the black hydroxide, like many other oxidised compounds of the platinoid metals, does
not dissolve in the ordinary oxygen acids, whilst the yellow hydroxide is easily soluble
and gives yellow solutions, which deposit imperfectly crystallised salts. Metallic
rhodium is easily obtained by igniting its oxygen and other compounds in hydrogen, or
by precipitation with zinc. It resembles platinum, and has a sp. gr. of 12·1. At the
ordinary temperature it decomposes formic acid into hydrogen and carbonic anhydride,
with development of heat (Deville). With the alkali sulphites, the salts of rhodium and
iridium of the type RX<sub>3</sub> give sparingly-soluble precipitates of double sulphites of the
composition R(SO<sub>3</sub>Na)<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, by means of which these metals may be separated from
solution, and also may be separated from each other, for a mixture of these salts when
treated with strong sulphuric acid gives a soluble iridium sulphate and leaves a red insoluble
double salt of rhodium and sodium. It may be remarked that the oxides Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and
Rh<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> are comparatively stable and are easily formed, and that they also form different
double salts (for instance, IrCl<sub>3</sub>,3KCl<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, RhCl<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, RhCl<sub>3</sub>,3NH<sub>4</sub>Cl1&frac12;H<sub>2</sub>O)
and compounds like the cobaltia compounds (for instance, luteo-salts RhX<sub>3</sub>,6NH<sub>3</sub>, roseo-salts,
RhX<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>, and purpureo-salts IrX<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.) <i>Iridious oxide</i>, Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is
obtained by fusing iridious chloride and its compounds with sodium carbonate, and
treating the mass with water. The oxide is then left as a black powder, which, when
strongly heated, is decomposed into iridium and oxygen; it is easily reduced, and is
insoluble in acids, which indicates the feeble basic character of this oxide, in many
respects resembling such oxides as cobaltic oxide, ceric or lead dioxide, &amp;c. It does not
dissolve when fused with potassium hydrogen sulphate. Rhodium oxide, Rh<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is a
far more energetic base. It dissolves when fused with potassium hydrogen sulphate.</p>

<p>From what has been said respecting the separation of platinum and rhodium it will
be understood how the compounds of <i>iridium</i>, which is the main associate of platinum,
are obtained. In describing the treatment of osmiridium we shall again have an
opportunity of learning the method of extraction of the compounds of this metal, which
has in recent times found a technical application in the form of its oxide, Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>;
this is obtained from many of the compounds of iridium by ignition with water, is
easily reduced by hydrogen, and is insoluble in acids. It is used in painting on china,
for giving a black colour. Iridium itself is more difficultly fusible than platinum, and
when fused it does not decompose acids or even aqua regia; it is extremely hard, and is
not malleable; its sp. gr. is 22·4. In the form of powder it dissolves in aqua regia, and
is even partially oxidised when heated in air, sets fire to hydrogen, and, in a word, closely
resembles platinum. Heated in an excess of chlorine it gives iridic chloride, IrCl<sub>4</sub>, but
this loses chlorine at 50°; it is, however, more stable in the form of double salts, which
have a characteristic <i>black</i> colour&mdash;for instance, Ir(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>&mdash;but they give iridious
chloride, IrCl<sub>3</sub>, when treated with sulphuric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_TRI_466" id="Footnote_9_TRI_466"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_TRI_466"><span class="label">[9 tri]</span></a>  We have yet to become acquainted with the two remaining associates of platinum&mdash;ruthenium
and osmium&mdash;whose most important property is that they are oxidised
even when heated in air, and that they are able to give <i>volatile</i> oxides of the form RuO<sub>4</sub>
and OsO<sub>4</sub>; these have a powerful odour (like iodine and nitrous anhydride). Both these
higher oxides are solids; they volatilise with great ease at 100°; the former is yellow
and the latter white. They are known as <i>ruthenic</i> and <i>osmic anhydrides</i>, although their
aqueous solutions (they both slowly dissolve in water) do not show an acid reaction, and
although they do not even expel carbonic anhydride from potassium carbonate, do not
give crystalline salts with bases, and their alkaline solutions partially deposit them
again when boiled (an excess of water decomposes the salts). The formulæ OsO<sub>4</sub> and
RuO<sub>4</sub> correspond with the vapour density of these oxides. Thus Deville found the
vapour density of osmic anhydride to be 128 (by the formula 127·5) referred to hydrogen.
Tennant and Vauquelin discovered this compound, and Berzelius, Wöhler, Fritzsche,
Struvé, Deville, Claus, Joly, and others helped in its investigation; nevertheless there
are still many questions concerning it which remain unsolved. It should be observed
that RO<sub>4</sub> is the highest known form for an oxygen compound, and RH<sub>4</sub> is the highest
known form for a compound of hydrogen; whilst the highest forms of acid hydrates
contain SiH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, SH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, ClHO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;all with four atoms of oxygen, and therefore in
this number there is apparently the limit for the simple forms of combination of hydrogen
and oxygen. In combination with <i>several</i> atoms of an element, or several elements,
there may be more than O<sub>4</sub> or H<sub>4</sub>, but a molecule never contains more than four atoms
of either O or H to one atom of another element. Thus the simplest forms of combination
of hydrogen and oxygen are exhausted by the list RH<sub>4</sub>, RH<sub>3</sub>, RH<sub>2</sub>, RH, RO, RO<sub>2</sub>,
RO<sub>3</sub>, RO<sub>4</sub>. The extreme members are RH<sub>4</sub> and RO<sub>4</sub>, and are only met with for such
elements as carbon, silicon, osmium, ruthenium, which also give RCl<sub>4</sub> with chlorine.
In these extreme forms, RH<sub>4</sub> and RO<sub>4</sub>, the compounds are the least stable (compare
SiH<sub>4</sub>, PH<sub>3</sub>, SH<sub>2</sub>, ClH, or RuO<sub>4</sub>, MoO<sub>3</sub>, ZrO<sub>2</sub>, SrO), and easily give up part, or even
all, their oxygen or hydrogen.</p>

<p>The primary source from which the compounds of ruthenium and osmium are
obtained is either <i>osmiridium</i> (the osmium predominates, from IrOs to IrOs<sub>4</sub>, sp. gr.
from 16 to 21), which occurs in platinum ores (it is distinguished from the grains of
platinum by its crystalline structure, hardness, and insolubility in aqua regia), or else
those insoluble residues which are obtained, as we saw above, after treating platinum
with aqua regia. Osmium predominates in these materials, which sometimes contain
from 30 p.c. to 40 p.c. of it, and rarely more than 4 p.c. to 5 p.c. of ruthenium. The
process for their treatment is as follows: they are first fused with 6 parts of zinc, and
the zinc is then extracted with dilute hydrochloric acid. The osmiridium thus treated
is, according to Fritzsche and Struvé's method, then added to a fused mixture of
potassium hydroxide and chlorate in an iron crucible; the mass as it begins to evolve
oxygen acts on the metal, and the reaction afterwards proceeds spontaneously. The
dark product is treated with water, and gives a solution of osmium and ruthenium in
the form of soluble salts, R<sub>2</sub>OsO<sub>4</sub> and R<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>, whilst the insoluble residue contains a
mixture of oxides of iridium (and some osmium, rhodium, and ruthenium), and grains
of metallic iridium still unacted on. According to Frémy's method the lumps of
osmiridium are straightway heated to whiteness in a porcelain tube in a stream of air or
oxygen, when the very volatile osmic anhydride is obtained directly, and is collected in
a well-cooled receiver, whilst the ruthenium gives a crystalline sublimate of the dioxide,
RuO<sub>2</sub>, which is, however, very difficultly volatile (it volatilises together with osmic
anhydride), and therefore remains in the cooler portions of the tube; this method does
not give volatile ruthenic anhydride, and the iridium and other metals are not oxidised
or give non-volatile products. This method is simple, and at once gives dry, pure osmic
anhydride in the receiver, and ruthenium dioxide in the sublimate. The air which
passes through the tube should be previously passed through sulphuric acid, not only in
order to dry it, but also to remove the organic and reducing dust. The vapour of osmic
anhydride must be powerfully cooled, and ultimately passed over caustic potash. A
third mode of treatment, which is most frequently employed, was proposed by Wöhler,
and consists in slightly heating (in order that the sodium chloride should not melt) an
intimate mixture of osmiridium and common salt in a stream of moist chlorine. The
metals then form compounds with chlorine and sodium chloride, whilst the osmium
forms the chloride, OsCl<sub>4</sub>, which reacts with the moisture, and gives osmic anhydride,
which is condensed. The ruthenium in this, as in the other processes, does not directly
give ruthenic anhydride, but is always extracted as the soluble ruthenium salt, K<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>,
obtained by fusion with potassium hydroxide and chlorate or nitrate. When the orange-coloured
ruthenate, K<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub>, is mixed with acids, the liberated ruthenic acid immediately
decomposes into the volatile ruthenic anhydride and the insoluble ruthenic oxide:
2K<sub>2</sub>RuO<sub>4</sub> + 4HNO<sub>3</sub> = RuO<sub>4</sub> + RuO<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O + 4KNO<sub>3</sub>. When once one of the above compounds
of ruthenium or osmium is procured it is easy to obtain all the remaining
compounds, and by reduction (by metals, hydrogen, formic acid, &amp;c.) the metals
themselves.</p>

<p>Osmic anhydride, OsO<sub>4</sub>, is very easily deoxidised by many methods. It blackens
organic substances, owing to reduction, and is therefore used in investigating vegetable
and animal, and especially nerve, preparations under the microscope. Although osmic
anhydride may be distilled in hydrogen, still complete reduction is accomplished when a
mixture of hydrogen and osmic anhydride is slightly ignited (just before it inflames). If
osmium be placed in the flame it is oxidised, and gives vapours of osmic anhydride, which
become reduced, and the flame gives a brilliant light. Osmic anhydride deflagrates
like nitre on red-hot charcoal; zinc, and even mercury and silver, reduce osmic anhydride
from its aqueous solutions into the lower oxides or metal; such reducing agents as
hydrogen sulphide, ferrous sulphate, or sulphurous anhydride, alcohol, &amp;c., act in the
same manner with great ease.</p>

<p>The lower oxides of osmium, ruthenium, and of the other elements of the platinum
series are not volatile, and it is noteworthy that the other elements behave differently.
On comparing SO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub>; As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., we observe a
converse phenomenon; the higher oxides are less volatile than the lower. In the case
of osmium all the oxides, with the exception of the highest, are non-volatile, and it may
therefore be thought that this higher form is more simply constituted than the lower.
It is possible that osmic oxide, OsO<sub>2</sub>, stands in the same relation to the anhydride as
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the lower oxide is perhaps Os<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, or is still more polymerised, which
would explain why the lower oxides, having a greater molecular weight, are less volatile
than the higher oxides, just as we saw in the case of the nitrogen oxides, N<sub>2</sub>O and NO.</p>

<p><i>Ruthenium and osmium</i>, obtained by the ignition or reduction of their compounds
in the form of powder, have a density considerably less than in the fused form, and differ
in this condition in their capacity for reaction; they are much more difficultly fused than
platinum and iridium, although ruthenium is more fusible than osmium. Ruthenium
in powder has a specific gravity of 8·5, the fused metal of 12·2; osmium in powder has a
specific gravity of 20·0, and when semi-fused&mdash;or, more strictly speaking, agglomerated&mdash;in
the oxyhydrogen flame, of 21·4, and fused 22·5. The powder of slightly-heated osmium
oxidises very easily in the air, and when ignited burns like tinder, directly forming the
odoriferous osmic anhydride (hence its name, from the Greek word signifying odour);
ruthenium also oxidises when heated in air, but with more difficulty, forming the oxide
RuO<sub>2</sub>. The oxides of the types RO, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and RO<sub>2</sub> (and their hydrates) obtained by
reduction from the higher oxides, and also from the chlorides, are analogous to those
given by the other platinum metals, in which respect osmium and ruthenium closely
resemble them. We may also remark that ruthenium has been found in the platinum
deposits of Borneo in the form of <i>laurite</i>, Ru<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, in grey octahedra of sp. gr. 7·0.</p>

<p>For osmium, Moraht and Wischin (1893) obtained free osmic acid, H<sub>2</sub>OsO<sub>4</sub>, by
decomposing K<sub>2</sub>OsO<sub>4</sub> with water, and precipitating with alcohol in a current of hydrogen
(because in air volatile OsO<sub>4</sub> is formed); with H<sub>2</sub>S, osmic acid gives OsO<sub>3</sub>(HS)<sub>2</sub> at the
ordinary temperature.</p>

<p>Debray and Joly showed that ruthenic anhydride, RuO<sub>4</sub>, fuses at 25°, boils at 100°,
and evolves oxygen when dissolved in potash, forming the salt KRuO<sub>4</sub> (not isomorphous
with potassium permanganate).</p>

<p>Joly (1891), who studied the ruthenium compounds in greater detail, showed that the
easily-formed KRuO<sub>4</sub> gives RuKO<sub>4</sub>RuO<sub>3</sub> when ignited, but it resembles KMnO<sub>4</sub> in many
respects. In general, Ru has much in common with Mn. Joly (1889) also showed that
if KNO<sub>3</sub> be added to a solution of RuCl<sub>3</sub> containing HCl, the solution becomes hot, and
a salt, RuCl<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>KCl, is formed, which enters into double decomposition and is very
stable. Moreover, if RuCl<sub>3</sub> be treated with an excess of nitric acid, it forms a salt,
RuCl<sub>3</sub>NOH<sub>2</sub>O, after being heated (to boiling) and the addition of HCl. The vapour
density of RuO<sub>4</sub>, determined by Debray and Joly, corresponds to that formula.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_467" id="Footnote_10_467"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_467"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Although palladium gives the same types of combination (with chlorine) as
platinum, its reduction to RX<sub>2</sub> is incomparably easier than that of platinic chloride, and
in the case of iridium it is also very easy. Iridic chloride, IrCl<sub>4</sub>, acts as an oxidising
agent, readily parts with a fourth of its chlorine to a number of substances, readily
evolves chlorine when heated, and it is only at low temperatures that chlorine and aqua
regia convert iridium into iridic chloride. In disengaging chlorine iridium more often
and easily gives the very stable iridious chloride, IrCl<sub>3</sub> (perhaps this substance is
Ir<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub> = IrCl<sub>2</sub>,IrCl<sub>4</sub>, insoluble in water, but soluble in potassium chloride, because it
forms the double salt K<sub>3</sub>IrCl<sub>6</sub>), than the dichloride, IrCl_2. This compound, corresponding
to IrX<sub>2</sub>, is very stable, and corresponds with the <i>basic oxide</i>, Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, resembling the
oxides Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Co<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. To this form there correspond ammoniacal compounds similar to
those given by cobaltic oxide. Although iridium also gives an acid in the form of the
salt K<sub>2</sub>Ir<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, it does not, like iron (and chromium), form the corresponding chloride,
IrCl<sub>6</sub>. In general, in this as in the other elements, it is impossible to predict the chlorine
compounds from those of oxygen. Just as there is no chloride SCl<sub>6</sub>, but only SCl<sub>2</sub>, so
also, although IrO<sub>3</sub> exists, IrCl<sub>6</sub> is wanting, the only chloride being IrCl<sub>4</sub>, and this
is unstable, like SCl<sub>2</sub>, and easily parts with its chlorine. In this respect rhodium is
very much like iridium (as platinum is like palladium). For RhCl<sub>4</sub> decomposes with
extreme ease, whilst rhodium chloride, RhCl<sub>3</sub>, is very stable, like many of the salts of
the type RhX<sub>3</sub>, although like the platinum elements these salts are easily reduced to
metal by the action of heat and powerful reagents. There is as close a resemblance
between osmium and ruthenium. Osmium when submitted to the action of dry chlorine
gives osmic chloride, OsCl<sub>4</sub>, but the latter is converted by water (as is osmium by moist
chlorine) into osmic anhydride, although the greater portion is then decomposed into
Os(HO)<sub>4</sub> and 4HCl, like a chloranhydride of an acid. In general this acid character is
more developed in osmium than in platinum and iridium. Having parted with chlorine,
osmic chloride, OsCl<sub>4</sub>, gives the unstable trichloride, OsCl<sub>3</sub>, and the stable soluble
dichloride, OsCl<sub>2</sub>, which corresponds with platinous chloride in its properties and
reactions. The relation of ruthenium to the halogens is of the same nature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_468" id="Footnote_11_468"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_468"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> This acid character is explained by the influence of the platinum on the hydrogen,
and by the attachment of the cyanogen groups. Thus cyanuric acid, H<sub>3</sub>(CN)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is an
energetic acid compared with cyanic acid, HCNO. And the formation of a compound
with five molecules of water of crystallisation, (PtH<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O), confirms the opinion
that platinum is able to form compounds of still higher types than that expressed
in its saline compounds, and, moreover, the combination of hydroplatinocyanic acid
with water does not reach the limit of the compounds which appears in PtCl<sub>4</sub>,2HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>A whole series of <i>platinocyanides</i> of the common type PtR<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub><i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O is obtained
by means of double decomposition with the potassium or hydrogen or silver salts. For
example, the salts of sodium and lithium contain, like the potassium salt, three molecules
of water. The sodium salt is soluble in water and alcohol. The ammonium salt has the
composition Pt(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O and gives crystals which reflect blue and rose-coloured
light. This ammonium salt decomposes at 300°, with evolution of water and ammonium
cyanide, leaving a greenish <i>platinum dicyanide</i>, Pt(CN)<sub>2</sub>, which is insoluble in water
and acid but dissolves in potassium cyanide, hydrocyanic acid, and other cyanides. The
same platinous cyanide is obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on the potassium
salts in the form of a reddish-brown amorphous precipitate. The most characteristic of the
platinocyanides are those of the alkaline earths. The magnesium salt PtMg(CN)<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O
crystallises in regular prisms, whose side faces are of a metallic green colour and terminal
planes dark blue. It shows a carmine-red colour along the main axis, and dark red
along the lateral axes; it easily loses water, (2H<sub>2</sub>O), at 40°, and then turns blue (it then
contains 5H<sub>2</sub>O, which is frequently the case with the platinocyanides). Its aqueous
solution is colourless, and an alcoholic solution deposits yellow crystals. The remainder
of the water is given off at 230°. It is obtained by saturating platinocyanic acid with
magnesia, or else by double decomposition between the barium salt and magnesium sulphate.
The strontium salt, SrPt(CN)<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O crystallises in milk-white plates having
a violet and green iridescence. When it effloresces in a desiccator, its surfaces have
a violet and metallic green iridescence. A colourless solution of the barium salt
PtBa(CN)<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O is obtained by saturating a solution of hydroplatinocyanic acid with
baryta, or by boiling the insoluble copper platinocyanide in baryta water. It crystallises
in monoclinic prisms of a yellow colour, with blue and green iridescence; it loses half its
water at 100°, and the whole at 150°. The ethyl salt, Pt(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>0, is also
very characteristic; its crystals are isomorphous with those of the potassium salt, and
are obtained by passing hydrochloric acid into an alcoholic solution of hydroplatinocyanic
acid. The facility with which they crystallise, the regularity of their forms,
and their remarkable play of colours, renders the preparation of the platinocyanides one
of the most attractive lessons of the laboratory.</p>

<p>By the action of chlorine or dilute nitric acid, the platinocyanides are converted into
salts of the composition PtM<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>5</sub>, which corresponds with Pt(CN)<sub>3</sub>,2KCN&mdash;that is,
they express the type of a non-existent form of oxidation of platinum, PtX<sub>3</sub> (<i>i.e.</i> oxide
Pt<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), just as potassium ferricyanide (FeCy<sub>3</sub>,3KCy) corresponds with ferric oxide, and
the ferrocyanide corresponds with the ferrous oxide. The potassium salt of this series
contains PtK<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>5</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, and forms brown regular prisms with a metallic lustre, and is
soluble in water but insoluble in alcohol. Alkalis re-convert this compound into the
ordinary platinocyanide K<sub>2</sub>Pt(CN)<sub>4</sub>, taking up the excess of cyanogen. It is remarkable
that the salts of the type PtM<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>5</sub> contain the same amount of water of crystallisation
as those of the type PtM<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>4</sub>. Thus the salts of potassium and lithium contain three,
and the salt of magnesium seven, molecules of water, like the corresponding salts of the
type of platinous oxide. Moreover, neither platinum nor any of its associates gives any
cyanogen compound corresponding with the oxide, <i>i.e.</i> having the composition PtK<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>6</sub>,
just as there are no compounds higher than those which correspond to RCy<sub>3</sub><i>n</i>MCy<sub>3</sub> for
cobalt or iron. This would appear to indicate the absence of any such cyanides, and
indeed, for no element are there yet known any poly-cyanides containing more than three
equivalents of cyanogen for one equivalent of the element. The phenomenon is perhaps
connected with the faculty of cyanogen of giving tricyanogen polymerides, such as cyanuric
acid, solid cyanogen chloride, &amp;c. Under the action of an excess of chlorine, a solution
of PtK<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub> gives (besides PtK<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>5</sub>) a product PtK<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, which evidently contains
the form PtX<sub>4</sub>, but at first the action of the chlorine (or the electrolysis of, or addition
of dilute peroxide of hydrogen to, a solution of PtK<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>4</sub>, acidulated with hydrochloric
acid) produces an easily soluble intermediate salt which crystallises in thin copper-red
needles (Wilm, Hadow, 1889). It only contains a small amount of chlorine, and
apparently corresponds to a compound 5PtK<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>4</sub> + PtK<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> + 24H<sub>2</sub>O. Under the
action of an excess of ammonia both these chlorine products are converted either completely
or in part (according to Wilm ammonia does not act upon PtK<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>4</sub>) into
PtCy<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, <i>i.e.</i> a platino-ammonia compound (<i>see</i> further on). It is also necessary to
pay attention to the fact that ruthenium and osmium&mdash;which, as we know, give higher
forms of oxidation than platinum&mdash;are also able to combine with a larger proportion of
potassium cyanide (but not of cyanogen) than platinum. Thus ruthenium forms a
crystalline <i>hydroruthenocyanic acid</i>, RuH<sub>4</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub>, which is soluble in water and alcohol,
and corresponds with the salts M<sub>4</sub>Ru(CN)<sub>6</sub>. There are exactly similar osmic compounds&mdash;for
example, K<sub>4</sub>Os(CN)<sub>6</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. The latter is obtained in the form of colourless,
sparingly-soluble regular tablets on evaporating the solution obtained from a fused
mixture of potassium osmiochloride, K<sub>2</sub>OsCl<sub>6</sub>, and potassium cyanide. These osmic and
ruthenic compounds fully correspond with potassium ferrocyanide, K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, not
only in their composition but also in their crystalline form and reactions, which again
demonstrates the close analogy between iron, ruthenium, and osmium, which we have
shown by giving these three elements a similar position (in the eighth group) in the
periodic system. For rhodium and iridium only salts of the same type as the ferricyanides,
M<sub>3</sub>RCy<sub>6</sub>, are known, and for palladium only of the type M<sub>2</sub>PdCy<sub>4</sub>, which are analogous
to the platinum salts. In all these examples a <i>constancy of the types</i> of the double
cyanides is apparent. In the eighth group we have iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and their
analogues ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, and also osmium, iridium, platinum,
gold. The double cyanides of iron, ruthenium, osmium have the type K<sub>4</sub>R(CN)<sub>6</sub>; of
cobalt, rhodium, iridium, the type K<sub>3</sub>R(CN)<sub>6</sub>; of nickel, palladium, platinum the type
K<sub>2</sub>R(CN)<sub>4</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>R(CN)<sub>5</sub>; and for copper, silver, gold there are known KR(CN)<sub>2</sub>, so
that the presence of 4, 3, 2, and 1 atoms of potassium corresponds with the
order of the elements in the periodic system. Those types which we have seen
in the ferrocyanides and ferricyanides of iron repeat themselves in all the platinoid
metals, and this naturally leads to the conclusion that the formation of similar
so-called double salts is of exactly the same nature as that of the ordinary salts. If, in
expressing the union of the elements in the oxygen salts, the existence of an
<i>aqueous residue</i> (hydroxyl group) be admitted, in which the hydrogen is replaced by a
metal, we have then only to apply this mode of expression to the double salts and the
analogy will be obvious, if only we remember that Cl<sub>2</sub>, (CN)<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c., are equivalent to
O, as we see in RO, RCl<sub>2</sub>, RSO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c. They all = X<sub>2</sub>, and, therefore, in point of fact,
wherever X (= Cl or OH, &amp;c.) can be placed, there (Cl<sub>2</sub>H), (SO<sub>4</sub>H), &amp;c., can also stand.
And as Cl<sub>2</sub>H = Cl + HCl and SO<sub>4</sub>H = OH + SO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., it follows that molecules HCl or SO<sub>3</sub>,
or, in general, whole molecules&mdash;for instance, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, salts, &amp;c., can annex themselves
to a compound containing X. (This is an indirect consequence of the law of substitution
which explains the origin of double salts, ammonia compounds, compounds with water
of crystallisation, &amp;c., by one general method.) Thus the double salt MgSO<sub>4</sub>,K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
according to this reasoning, <i>may be</i> considered as a substance of the same type as
MgCl<sub>2</sub>, namely, as = Mg(SO<sub>4</sub>K)<sub>2</sub>, and the alums as derived from Al(OH)(SO<sub>4</sub>), namely, as
Al(SO<sub>4</sub>K)(SO<sub>4</sub>). Without stopping to pursue this digression further, we will apply
these considerations to the type of the ferrocyanides and ferricyanides and their
platinum analogues. Such a salt as K<sub>2</sub>PtCy<sub>4</sub> may accordingly be regarded as Pt(Cy<sub>2</sub>K)<sub>2</sub>,
like Pt(OH)<sub>2</sub>; and such a salt as PtK<sub>2</sub>Cy<sub>5</sub> as PtCy(Cy<sub>2</sub>K)<sub>2</sub>, the analogue of PtX(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
or AlX(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and other compounds of the type RX<sub>3</sub>. Potassium ferricyanide and the
analogous compounds of cobalt, iridium, and rhodium, belong to the same type, with the
same difference as there is between RX(OH)<sub>2</sub> and R(OH)<sub>3</sub>, since FeK<sub>3</sub>Cy<sub>6</sub> = Fe(Cy<sub>2</sub>K)<sub>3</sub>.
Limiting myself to these considerations, which may partially elucidate the nature
of double salts, I will now pass again to the complex saline compounds known for
platinum.</p>

<p>(<i>A</i>) On mixing a solution of potassium thiocyanate with a solution of potassium
platinosochloride, K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>4</sub>, they form a double thiocyanate, PtK<sub>2</sub>(CNS)<sub>4</sub>, which is easily
soluble in water and alcohol, crystallises in red prisms, and gives an orange-coloured
solution, which precipitates salts of the heavy metals. The action of sulphuric acid
on the lead salt of the same type gives the acid itself, PtH<sub>2</sub>(SCN)<sub>4</sub>, which corresponds
with these salts. The type of these compounds is evidently the same as that of
the cyanides.</p>

<p>(<i>B</i>) <i>Platinous chloride</i>, PtCl<sub>2</sub>, which is insoluble in water, forms <i>double salts with
the metallic chlorides</i>. These double chlorides are soluble in water, and capable of
crystallising. Hence when a hydrochloric acid solution of platinous chloride is mixed
with solutions of metallic salts and evaporated it forms crystalline salts of a red or
yellow colour. Thus, for example, the potassium salt, PtK<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>, is red, and easily
soluble in water; the sodium salt is also soluble in alcohol; the barium salt,
PtBaCl<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, is soluble in water, but the silver salt, PtAg<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>, is insoluble in water,
and may be used for obtaining the remaining salts by means of double decomposition
with their chlorides.</p>

<p>(<i>C</i>) A remarkable example of the complex compounds of platinum was observed by
Schützenberger (1868). He showed that finely-divided platinum in the presence of
chlorine and carbonic oxide at 250°-300° gives phosgene and a volatile compound containing
platinum. The same substance is formed by the action of carbonic oxide on
platinous chloride. It decomposes with an explosion in contact with water. Carbon
tetrachloride dissolves a portion of this substance, and on evaporation gives crystals of
2PtCl<sub>2</sub>,3CO, whilst the compound PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2CO remains undissolved. When fused and
sublimed it gives yellow needles of PtCl<sub>2</sub>,CO, and in the presence of an excess of
carbonic oxide PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2CO is formed. These compounds are fusible (the first at 250°, the
second at 142°, and the third at 195°). In this case (as in the double cyanides) combination
takes place, because both carbonic oxide and platinous chloride are unsaturated
compounds capable of further combination. The carbon tetrachloride solution absorbs
NH<sub>3</sub> and gives PtCl<sub>2</sub>,CO,2NH<sub>3</sub>, and PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2CO,2NH<sub>3</sub>, and these substances are analogous
(Foerster, Zeisel, Jörgensen) to similar compounds containing complex amines (for
instance, pyridine, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>N), instead of NH<sub>3</sub>, and ethylene, &amp;c., instead of CO, so that here
we have a whole series of complex platino-compounds. The compound PtCl<sub>2</sub>CO
dissolves in hydrochloric acid without change, and the solution disengages all the
carbonic oxide when KCN is added to it, which shows that those forces which bind
2 molecules of KCN to PtCl<sub>2</sub> can also bind the molecule CO, or 2 molecules of CO.
When the hydrochloric acid solution of PtCl<sub>2</sub>CO is mixed with a solution of sodium
acetate or acetic acid, it gives a precipitate of PtOCO, <i>i.e.</i> the Cl<sub>2</sub> is replaced by oxygen
(probably because the acetate is decomposed by water). This oxide, PtOCO, splits up
into Pt + CO<sub>2</sub> at 350°. PtSCO is obtained by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen upon
PtCl<sub>2</sub>CO. All this leads to the conclusion that the group PtCO is able to assimilate
X<sub>2</sub> = Cl<sub>2</sub>, S, O, &amp;c. (Mylius, Foerster, 1891). Pullinger (1891), by igniting spongy
platinum at 250°, first in a stream of chlorine, and then in a stream of carbonic oxide,
obtained (besides volatile products) a non-volatile yellow substance which remained
unchanged in air and disengaged chlorine and phosgene gas when ignited; its composition
was PtCl<sub>6</sub>(CO)<sub>2</sub>, which apparently proves it to be a compound of PtCl<sub>2</sub> and
2COCl<sub>2</sub>, as PtCl<sub>2</sub> is able to combine with oxychlorides, and forms somewhat stable
compounds.</p>

<p>(<i>D</i>) The faculty of platinous chloride for forming stable compounds with divers substances
shows itself in the formation of the compound PtCl<sub>2</sub>,PCl<sub>3</sub> by the action of phosphorus
pentachloride at 250° on platinum powder (Pd reacts in a similar manner,
according to Fink, 1892). The product contains both phosphorus pentachloride and
platinum, whilst the presence of PtCl<sub>2</sub> is shown in the fact that the action of water
produces <i>chlorplatino-phosphorous acid</i>, PtCl<sub>2</sub>P(OH)<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>(<i>E</i>) After the cyanides, the <i>double salts</i> of platinum <i>formed by sulphurous acid</i> are
most distinguished for their stability and characteristic properties. This is all the more
instructive, as sulphurous acid is only feebly energetic, and, moreover, in these, as in all
its compounds, it exhibits a dual reaction. The salts of sulphurous acid, R<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, either
react as salts of a feeble bibasic acid, where the group SO<sub>3</sub> presents itself as bivalent,
and consequently equal to X<sub>2</sub>, or else they react after the manner of salts of a monobasic
acid containing the same residue, RSO<sub>3</sub>, as occurs in the salts of sulphuric acid. In sulphurous
acid this residue is combined with hydrogen, H(SO<sub>3</sub>H), whilst in sulphuric acid
it is united with the aqueous residue (hydroxyl), OH(SO<sub>3</sub>H). These two forms of action
of the sulphites appear in their reactions with the platinum salts&mdash;that is to say, salts of
both kinds are formed, and they both correspond with the type PtH<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub>. The one
series of salts contain PtH<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and their reactions are due to the bivalent residue
of sulphurous acid, which replaces X<sub>2</sub>. The others, which have the composition
PtR<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>H)<sub>4</sub>, contain sulphoxyl. The latter salts will evidently react like acids; they
are formed simultaneously with the salts of the first kind, and pass into them. These
salts are obtained either by directly dissolving platinous oxide in water containing sulphurous
acid, or by passing sulphurous anhydride into a solution of platinous chloride
in hydrochloric acid. If a solution of platinous chloride or platinous oxide in sulphurous
acid be saturated with sodium carbonate, it forms a white, sparingly soluble precipitate
containing PtNa<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>Na)<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O. If this precipitate be dissolved in a small quantity of
hydrochloric acid and left to evaporate at the ordinary temperature, it deposits a salt of
the other type, PtNa<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, in the form of a yellow powder, which is sparingly
soluble in water. The potassium salt analogous to the first salt, PtK<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>K)<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, is
precipitated by passing sulphurous anhydride into a solution of potassium sulphite in
which platinous oxide is suspended. A similar salt is known for ammonium, and with
hydrochloric acid it gives a salt of the second kind, Pt(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. If ammonio-chloride
of platinum be added to an aqueous solution of sulphurous anhydride, it is first
deoxidised, and chlorine is evolved, forming a salt of the type PtX<sub>2</sub>; a double decomposition
then takes place with the ammonium sulphite, and a salt of the composition
Pt(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>H) is formed (in a desiccator). The acid character of this substance is
explained by the fact that it contains the elements SO<sub>3</sub>H&mdash;sulphoxyl, with the hydrogen
not yet displaced by a metal. On saturating a solution of this acid with potassium
carbonate it gives orange-coloured crystals of a potassium salt of the composition
Pt(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>3</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>K). Here it is evident that an equivalent of chlorine in Pt(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> is
replaced by the univalent residue of sulphurous acid. Among these salts, that of the
composition Pt(NH<sub>4</sub>)Cl<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>3</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O is very readily formed, and crystallises in well-formed
colourless crystals; it is obtained by dissolving ammonium platinosochloride,
Pt(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>, in an aqueous solution of sulphurous acid. The difficulty with which sulphurous
anhydride and platinum are separated from these salts indicates the same basic
character in these compounds as is seen in the double cyanides of platinum. In their
passage into a complex salt, the metal platinum and the group SO<sub>2</sub> modify their
relations (compared with those of PtX<sub>2</sub> or SO<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>), just as the chlorine in the salts KClO,
KClO<sub>3</sub>, and KClO<sub>4</sub> is modified in its relations as compared with hydrochloric acid or
potassium chloride.</p>

<p>(<i>F</i>) No less characteristic are the <i>platinonitrites</i> formed by platinous oxide. They
correspond with nitrous acid, whose salts, RNO<sub>2</sub>, contain the univalent radicle, NO<sub>2</sub>,
which is capable of replacing chlorine, and therefore the salts of this kind should form a
common type PtR<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, and such a salt of potassium has actually been obtained by
mixing a solution of potassium platinosochloride with a solution of potassium nitrite,
when the liquid becomes colourless, especially if it be heated, which indicates the change
in the chemical distribution of the elements. As the liquid decolorises it gradually
deposits sparingly soluble, colourless prisms of the potassium salt K<sub>2</sub>Pt(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, which
does not contain any water. With silver nitrate a solution of this salt gives a precipitate
of silver platinonitrite, PtAg<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. The silver of this salt may be replaced by other
metals by means of double decomposition with metallic chlorides. The sparingly soluble
barium salt, when treated with an equivalent quantity of sulphuric acid, gives a soluble
acid, which separates, under the receiver of an air-pump, in red crystals; this acid has
the composition PtH<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>. To the potassium salt, K<sub>2</sub>Pt(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, there correspond
(Vèzes, 1892) K<sub>2</sub>Pt(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>2</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>Pt(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and other compounds of the same type
K<sub>2</sub>PtX<sub>6</sub>, where X is partly replaced by Cl or Br and partly by (NO<sub>2</sub>), showing a
transition towards the type of the double salts like the platino-ammoniacal salts. (The
corresponding double sodium nitrite salt of cobalt is soluble in water, while the K,NH<sub>4</sub>
and many other salts are insoluble in water, as I was informed by Prof. K. Winkler
in 1894).</p>

<p>In all the preceding complex compounds of Pt we see a common type PtX<sub>2</sub>,2MX
(<i>i.e.</i> of double salts corresponding to PtO) or PtM<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub> = Pt(MX<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, corresponding to
Pt(HO)<sub>2</sub> with the replacement of O by its equivalent X<sub>2</sub>. Two other facts must also be
noted. In the first place these X's generally correspond to elements (like chlorine) or
groups (like CN, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.), which are capable of further combination. In the
second place all the compounds of the type PtM<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub> are capable of combining with
chlorine or similar elements, and thus passing into compounds of the types PtX<sub>3</sub> or PtX<sub>4</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_469" id="Footnote_12_469"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_469"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The platinum salt and ammonia, when once combined together, are no longer
subject to their ordinary reactions but form compounds which are comparatively very
stable. The question at once suggests itself to all who are acquainted with these phenomena,
as to what is the relation of the elements contained in these compounds. The first
explanation is that these compounds are salts of ammonium in which the hydrogen is
partially replaced by platinum. This is the view, with certain shades of difference, held
by many respecting the platino-ammonium compounds. They were regarded in this
light by Gerhardt, Schiff, Kolbe, Weltzien, and many others. If we suppose the hydrogen
in 2NH<sub>4</sub>X to be replaced by bivalent platinum (as in the salts PtX<sub>2</sub>), we shall
obtain

&mdash;that is, the compound PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>. The compound with 4NH<sub>3</sub> will
then be represented by a further substitution of the hydrogen in ammonia by ammonium
itself&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> as NH<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>X)<sub>2</sub>Pt or PtX<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>. A modification of this view is found
in that representation of compounds of this kind which is based on atomicity. As
platinum in PtX<sub>2</sub> is bivalent, has two affinities, and ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, is also bivalent,
because nitrogen is quinquivalent and is here only combined with H<sub>3</sub>, it is evident what
bonds should be represented in PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> and in PtX<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>. In the former, Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>Cl)<sub>2</sub>,
the nitrogen of each atom of ammonia is united by three affinities with H<sub>3</sub>, by one with
platinum, and by the fifth with chlorine. The other compound is Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>.NH<sub>3</sub>Cl)<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that
is, the N is united by one affinity with the other N, whilst the remaining bonds are the
same as in the first salt. It is evident that this union or chain of ammonias has no
obvious limit, and the most essential fault of such a mode of representation is that it does
not indicate at all what number of ammonias are capable of being retained by platinum.
Moreover, it is hardly possible to admit the bond between nitrogen and platinum in such
stable compounds, for these kinds of affinities are, at all events, feeble, and cannot lead
to stability, but would rather indicate explosive and easily-decomposed compounds.
Moreover, it is not clear why this platinum, which is capable of giving PtX<sub>4</sub>, does not act
with its remaining affinities when the addition of ammonia to PtX<sub>2</sub> takes place. These,
and certain other considerations which indicate the imperfection of this representation of
the structure of the platino-ammonium salts, cause many chemists to incline more to the
representations of Berzelius, Claus, Gibbs, and others, who suppose that NH<sub>3</sub> is able to
combine with substances, to adjoin itself or pair itself with them (this kind of combination
is called &lsquo;Paarung&rsquo;) without altering the fundamental capacity of a substance for further
combinations. Thus, in PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, the ammonia is the associate of PtX<sub>2</sub>, as is
expressed by the formula N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>PtX<sub>2</sub>. Without enlarging on the exposition of the details
of this doctrine, we will only mention that it, like the first, does not render it possible to
foresee a limit to the compounds with ammonia; it isolates compounds of this kind
into a special and artificial class; does not show the connection between compounds of
this and of other kinds, and therefore it essentially only expresses the fact of the combination
with ammonia and the modification in its ordinary reactions. For these
reasons we do not hold to either of these proposed representations of the ammonio-platinum
compounds, but regard them from the point of view cited above with reference
to double salts and water of crystallisation&mdash;that is, we embrace all these compounds
under the representation of compounds of complex types. The type of the compound
PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> is far more probably the same as that of PtX<sub>2</sub>,2Z&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> as PtX<sub>4</sub>, or, still more
accurately and truly, it is a compound of the same type as PtX<sub>2</sub>,2KX or PtX<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c.
Although the platinum first entered into PtK<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub> as the type PtX<sub>2</sub>, yet its character has
changed in the same manner as the character of sulphur changes when from SO<sub>2</sub> the compound
SO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> is obtained, or when KClO<sub>4</sub>, the higher form, is obtained from KCl. For us
as yet there is no question as to <i>what</i> affinities hold X<sub>2</sub> and what hold 2NH<sub>3</sub>, because this
is a question which arises from the supposition of the existence of different affinities in the
atoms, which there is no reason for taking as a common phenomenon. It seems to me
that it is most important <i>as a commencement</i> to render clear the analogy in the formation
of various complex compounds, and it is this analogy of the ammonia compounds with
those of water of crystallisation and double salts that forms the main object of the
primary generalisation. We recognise in platinum, at all events, not only the four
affinities expressed in the compound PtCl<sub>4</sub>, but a much larger number of them, if only
the <i>summation of affinities</i> is actually possible. Thus, in sulphur we recognise not two
but a much greater number of affinities; it is clear that at least six affinities can act.
So also among the analogues of platinum: osmic anhydride, OsO<sub>4</sub>, Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>, PtH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, &amp;c.
indicate the existence of at least eight affinities; whilst, in chlorine, judging from the
compound KClO<sub>4</sub> = ClO<sub>3</sub>(OK) = ClX<sub>7</sub>, we must recognise at least seven affinities,
instead of the one which is accepted. The latter mode of calculating affinities is a tribute
to that period of the development of science when only the simplest hydrogen compounds
were considered, and when all complex compounds were entirely neglected (they were
placed under the class of molecular compounds). This is insufficient for the present
state of knowledge, because we find that, in complex compounds as in the most simple, the
same constant types or modes of equilibrium are repeated, and the character of certain
elements is greatly modified in the passage from the most simple into very complex
compounds.</p>

<p>Judging from the most complex platino-ammonium compounds PtCl<sub>4</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>, we
should admit the possibility of the formation of compounds of the type PtX<sub>4</sub>Y<sub>4</sub>, where
Y<sub>4</sub> = 4X<sub>2</sub> = 4NH<sub>3</sub>, and this shows that those forces which form such a characteristic
series of double platinocyanides PtK<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>4</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, probably also determine the formation
of the higher ammonia derivatives, as is seen on comparing&mdash;</p>

<p>Moreover, it is obviously much more natural to ascribe the faculty for combination
with <i>n</i>Y to the whole of the acting elements&mdash;that is, to PtX<sub>2</sub> or PtX<sub>4</sub>, and not to
platinum alone. Naturally such compounds are not produced with any Y. With
certain X's there only combine certain Y's. The best known and most frequently-formed
compounds of this kind are those with water&mdash;that is, compounds with water of
crystallisation. Compounds with salts are double salts; also we know that similar
compounds are also frequently formed by means of ammonia. Salts of zinc, ZnX<sub>2</sub>,
copper, CuX<sub>2</sub>, silver, AgX, and many others give similar compounds, but these and many
other <i>ammonio-metallic</i> saline compounds are unstable, and readily part with their
combined ammonia, and it is only in the elements of the platinum group and in the
group of the analogues of iron, that we observe the faculty to form stable ammonio-metallic
compounds. It must be remembered that the metals of the platinum and iron
groups are able to form several high grades of oxidation which have an acid character,
and consequently in the lower degrees of combination there yet remain affinities capable
of retaining other elements, and they probably retain ammonia, and hold it the more
stably, because all the properties of the platinum compounds are rather acid than basic&mdash;that
is, PtX<sub>n</sub> recalls rather HX or SnX<sub>n</sub> or CX<sub>n</sub> than KX, CaX<sub>2</sub>, BaX<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., and
ammonia naturally will rather combine with an acid than with a basic substance.
Further, a dependence, or certain connection of the forms of oxidation with the ammonia
compounds, is seen on comparing the following compounds:</p>

<p>We know that platinum and palladium give compounds of lower types than iridium
and rhodium, whilst ruthenium and osmium give the highest forms of oxidation; this
shows itself in this case also. We have purposely cited the same compounds with 4NH<sub>3</sub>
for osmium and ruthenium as we have for platinum and palladium, and it is then seen
that Ru and Os are capable of retaining 2H<sub>2</sub>O and 3H<sub>2</sub>O, besides Cl<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub>, which
the compounds of platinum and palladium are unable to do. The same ideas
which were developed in Note <a href="#Footnote_35_445">35</a>, Chapter XXII. respecting the cobaltia compounds are
perfectly applicable to the present case, <i>i.e.</i> to the <i>platinia</i> compounds or ammonia
compounds of the platinum metals, among which Rh and Ir give compounds which are
perfectly analogous to the cobaltia compounds.</p>

<p>Iridium and rhodium, which easily give compounds of the type RX<sub>3</sub>, give compounds
(Claus) of the type IrX<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, of a rose colour, and RhX<sub>3</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, of a yellow colour.
Jörgensen, in his researches on these compounds, showed their entire analogy with the
cobalt compounds, as was to be expected from the periodic system.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_470" id="Footnote_13_470"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_470"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Subsequently, a whole series of such compounds was obtained with various
elements in the place of the (non-reacting) chlorine, and nevertheless they, like the
chlorine, reacted with difficulty, whilst the second portion of the X's introduced into
such salts easily underwent reaction. This formed the most important reason for the
interest which the study of the composition and structure of the platino-ammonium
salts subsequently presented to many chemists, such as Reiset, Blomstrand, Peyrone,
Raeffski, Gerhardt, Buckton, Clève, Thomsen, Jörgensen, Kournakoff, Verner, and
others. The salts PtX<sub>4</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, discovered by Gerhardt, also exhibited several different
properties in the two pairs of X's. In the remaining platino-ammonium salts all the
X's appear to react alike.</p>

<p>The quality of the X's, retainable in the platino-ammonium salts, may be considerably
modified, and they may frequently be wholly or partially replaced by hydroxyl. For
example, the action of ammonia on the nitrate of Gerhardt's base, Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, in a
boiling solution, gradually produces a yellow crystalline precipitate which is nothing
else than a <i>basic hydrate</i> or <i>alkali</i>, Pt(OH)<sub>4</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>. It is sparingly soluble in water, but
gives directly soluble salts PtX<sub>4</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> with acids. The stability of this hydroxide is
such that potash does not expel ammonia from it, even on boiling, and it does not change
below 130°. Similar properties are shown by the hydroxide Pt(OH)<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> and the
oxide PtO,2NH<sub>3</sub> of Reiset's second base. But the hydroxides of the compounds containing
4NH<sub>3</sub> are particularly remarkable. The presence of ammonia renders them
soluble and energetic. The brevity of this work does not permit us, however, to
mention many interesting particulars in connection with this subject.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_471" id="Footnote_14_471"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_471"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Hydroxides are known corresponding with Gros's salts, which contain one hydroxyl
group in the place of that chlorine or haloid which in Gros's salts reacts with difficulty,
and these hydroxides do not at once show the properties of alkalis, just as the chlorine
which stands in the same place does not react distinctly; but still, after the prolonged
action of acids, this hydroxyl group is also replaced by acids. Thus, for example, the action
of nitric acid on Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub> causes the non-active chlorine to react, but in the
product all the chlorine is not replaced by NO<sub>3</sub>, but only half, and the other half is replaced
by the hydroxyl group: Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub> + HNO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = Pt(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>(OH),4NH<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl;
and this is particularly characteristic, because here the hydroxyl group has not reacted
with the acid&mdash;an evident sign of the non-alkaline character of this residue. I think it
may be well to call attention to the fact that the composition of the ammonio-metallosalts
very often exhibits a correspondence between the amount of X's and the amount
of NH<sub>3</sub>, of such a nature that we find they contain either XNH<sub>3</sub> or the grouping
X<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>; for example, Pt(XNH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and Pt(X<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, Co(X<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, Pt(XNH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c.
Judging from this, the view of the constitution of the double cyanides of platinum
given in Note <a href="#Footnote_11_468">11</a> finds some confirmation here, but, in my opinion, all questions
respecting the composition (and structure) of the ammoniacal, double, complex, and
crystallisation compounds stand connected with the solution of questions respecting the
formation of compounds of various degrees of stability, among which a theory of
solutions must be included, and therefore I think that the time has not yet come for a
complete generalisation of the data which exist for these compounds; and here I again
refer the reader to Prof. Kournakoff's work cited in Chapter XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_35_445">35</a>. However,
we may add a few individual remarks concerning the platinia compounds.</p>

<p>To the common properties of the platino-ammonium salts, we must add not only their
<i>stability</i> (feeble acids and alkalis do not decompose them, the ammonia is not evolved
by heating, &amp;c.), but also the fact that the ordinary reactions of platinum are concealed
in them to as great an extent as those of iron in the ferricyanides. Thus neither alkalis
nor hydrogen sulphide will separate the platinum from them. For example, sulphuretted
hydrogen in acting on Gros's salts gives sulphur, removes half the chlorine by means of
its hydrogen, and forms salts of Reiset's first base. This may be understood or explained
by considering the platinum in the molecule as covered, walled up by the ammonia, or
situated in the centre of the molecule, and therefore inaccessible to reagents. On this
assumption, however, we should expect to find clearly-expressed ammoniacal properties,
and this is not the case. Thus ammonia is easily decomposed by chlorine, whilst in
acting on the platino-ammonium salts containing PtX<sub>2</sub> and 2NH<sub>3</sub> or 4NH<sub>3</sub>, chlorine
combines and does not destroy the ammonia; it converts Reiset's salts into those of
Gros and Gerhardt. Thus from PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> there is formed PtX<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, and from
PtX<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub> the salt of Gros's base PtX<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>. This shows that the amount of
chlorine which combines is not dependent on the amount of ammonia present, but is due
to the basic properties of platinum. Owing to this some chemists suppose the ammonia
to be inactive or passive in certain compounds. It appears to me that these relations,
these modifications, in the usual properties of ammonia and platinum are explained
directly by their mutual combination. Sulphur, in sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, and
hydrogen sulphide, SH<sub>2</sub>, is naturally one and the same, but if we only knew of it in the
form of hydrogen sulphide, then, having obtained it in the form of sulphurous anhydride,
we should consider its properties as hidden. The oxygen in magnesia, MgO, and in
nitric peroxide, NO<sub>2</sub>, is so different that there is no resemblance. Arsenic no longer
reacts in its compounds with hydrogen as it reacts in its compounds with chlorine, and
in their compounds with nitrogen all metals modify both their reactions and their physical
properties. We are accustomed to judge the metals by their saline compounds with
haloid groups, and ammonia by its compounds with acid substances, and here, in the
platino-compounds, if we assume the platinum to be bound to the entire mass of the
ammonia&mdash;to its hydrogen and nitrogen&mdash;we shall understand that both the platinum
and ammonia modify their characters. Far more complicated is the question why a portion
of the chlorine (and other haloid simple and complex groups) in Gros's salts acts in
a different manner from the other portion, and why only half of it acts in the usual way.
But this also is not an exclusive case. The chlorine in potassium chlorate or in carbon
tetrachloride does not react with the same ease with metals as the chlorine in the salts
corresponding with hydrochloric acid. In this case it is united to oxygen and carbon,
whilst in the platino-ammonium compounds it is united partly to platinum and partly to
the platino-ammonium group. Many chemists, moreover, suppose that a part of the
chlorine is united directly to the platinum and the other part to the nitrogen of the
ammonia, and thus explain the difference of the reactions; but chlorine united to
platinum reacts as well with a silver salt as the chlorine of ammonium chloride, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl,
or nitrosyl chloride, NOCl, although there is no doubt that in this case there is a
union between the chlorine and nitrogen. Hence it is necessary to explain the absence
of a facile reactive capacity in a portion of the chlorine by the conjoint influence
of the platinum and ammonia on it, whilst the other portion may be admitted as
being under the influence of the platinum only, and therefore as reacting as in other
salts. By admitting a certain kind of stable union in the platino-ammonium grouping,
it is possible to imagine that the chlorine does not react with its customary facility,
because access to a portion of the atoms of chlorine in this complex grouping is difficult,
and the chlorine union is not the same as we usually meet in the saline compounds of
chlorine. These are the grounds on which we, in refuting the now accepted explanations
of the reactions and formation of the platino-compounds, pronounce the following opinion
as to their structure.</p>

<p>In characterising the platino-ammonium compounds, it is necessary to bear in mind
that compounds which already contain PtX<sub>4</sub> do not combine directly with NH<sub>3</sub>, and that
such compounds as PtX<sub>4</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub> only proceed from PtX<sub>2</sub>, and therefore it is natural to
conclude that those affinities and forces which cause PtX<sub>2</sub> to combine with X<sub>2</sub> also cause
it to combine with 2NH<sub>3</sub>. And having the compound PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, and supposing that in
subsequently combining with Cl<sub>2</sub> it reacts with those affinities which produce the compounds
of platinic chloride, PtCl<sub>4</sub>, with water, potassium chloride, potassium cyanide,
hydrochloric acid, and the like, we explain not only the fact of combination, but also
many of the reactions occurring in the transition of one kind of platino-ammonium salts
into another. Thus by this means we explain the fact that (1) PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> combines
with 2NH<sub>3</sub>, forming salts of Reiset's first base; (2) and the fact that this compound
(represented as follows for distinctness), PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, when heated, or even when
boiled in solution, again passes into PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> (which resembles the easy disengagement
of water of crystallisation, &amp;c.); (3) the fact that PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> is capable of absorbing,
under the action of the same forces, a molecule of chlorine, PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,Cl<sub>2</sub>, which it
then retains with energy, because it is attracted, not only by the platinum, but also by the
hydrogen of the ammonia; (4) the fact that this chlorine held in this compound (of
Gerhardt) will have a position unusual in salts, which will explain a certain (although
very feebly-marked) difficulty of reaction; (5) the fact that this does not exhaust the
faculty of platinum for further combination (we need only recall the compound
PtCl<sub>4</sub>,2HCl,16H<sub>2</sub>O), and that therefore both PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,Cl<sub>2</sub> and PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> are still
capable of combination, whence the latter, with chlorine, gives PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,Cl<sub>2</sub>,
after the type of PtX<sub>4</sub>Y<sub>4</sub> (and perhaps higher); (6) the fact that Gros's compounds
thus formed are readily reconverted into the salts of Reiset's first base when acted on
by reducing agents; (7) the fact that in Gros's salts, PtX<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>(NH<sub>3</sub>X)<sub>2</sub>, the newly-attached
chlorine or haloid will react with difficulty with salts of silver, &amp;c., because it is
attached both to the platinum and to the ammonia, for both of which it has an attraction;
(8) the fact that the faculty for further combination is not even yet exhausted in the
type of Gros's salts, and that we actually have a compound of Gros's chlorine salt with
platinous chloride and with platinic chloride; the salt PtSO<sub>4</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,SO<sub>4</sub> combines
further also with H<sub>2</sub>O; (9) the fact that such a faculty of combination with new
molecules is naturally more developed in the lower forms of combination than in the
higher. Hence the salts of Reiset's first base&mdash;for example, PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;both
combine with water and give precipitates (soluble in water but not in hydrochloric acid)
of double salts with many salts of the heavy metals&mdash;for example, with lead chloride,
cupric chloride, and also with platinic and platinous chlorides (Buckton's salts). The
latter compounds will have the composition PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,PtCl<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that is, the same
composition as the salts of Reiset's second base, but it cannot be identical with it.
Such an interesting case does actually exist. The first salt, PtCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>,PtCl<sub>2</sub>, is green,
insoluble in water and in hydrochloric acid, and is known as <i>Magnus's salt</i>, and the
second, PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, is Reiset's yellow, sparingly soluble (in water). They are polymeric,
namely, the first contains twice the number of elements held in the second, and at the
same time they easily pass into each other. If ammonia be added to a hot hydrochloric
acid solution of platinous chloride, it forms the salt PtCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>, but in the presence of
an excess of platinous chloride it gives Magnus's salt. On boiling the latter in ammonia it
gives a colourless soluble salt of Reiset's first base, PtCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>, and if this be boiled with
water, ammonia is disengaged, and a salt of Reiset's second base, PtCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>, is obtained.</p>

<p>A class of platino-ammonium isomerides (obtained by Millon and Thomsen) are also
known. Buckton's salts&mdash;for example, the copper salt&mdash;were obtained by them from the
salts of Reiset's first base, PtCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>, by treatment with a solution of cupric chloride,
&amp;c., and therefore, according to our method of expression, Buckton's copper salt will be
PtCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>,CuCl<sub>2</sub>. This salt is soluble in water, but not in hydrochloric acid. In it
the ammonia must be considered as united to the platinum. But if cupric chloride be
dissolved in ammonia, and a solution of platinous chloride in ammonium chloride is
added to it, a violet precipitate is obtained of the same composition as Buckton's
salt, which, however, is insoluble in water, but soluble in hydrochloric acid. In this a
portion, if not all, of the ammonia must be regarded as united to the copper, and it must
therefore be represented as CuCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>,PtCl<sub>2</sub>. This form is identical in composition
but different in properties (is isomeric) with the preceding salt (Buckton's). The salt of
Magnus is intermediate between them, PtCl<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>,PtCl<sub>2</sub>; it is insoluble in water and
hydrochloric acid. These and certain other instances of isomeric compounds in the
series of the platino-ammonium salts throw a light on the nature of the compounds in
question, just as the study of the isomerides of the carbon compounds has served and
still serves as the chief cause of the rapid progress of organic chemistry. In conclusion,
we may add that (according to the law of substitution) we must necessarily expect all
kinds of intermediate compounds between the platino and analogous ammonia derivatives
on the one hand, and the complex compounds of nitrous acid on the other.
Perhaps the instance of the reaction of ammonia upon osmic anhydride, OsO<sub>4</sub>, observed
by Fritsche, Frémy, and others, and more fully studied by Joly (1891), belongs to this
class. The latter showed that when ammonia acts upon an alkaline solution of OsO<sub>4</sub>
the reaction proceeds according to the equation: OsO<sub>4</sub> + KHO + NH<sub>3</sub> = OsNKO<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.
It might be imagined that in this case the ammonia is oxidised, probably forming the
residue of nitrous acid (NO), while the type OsO<sub>4</sub> is deoxidised into OsO<sub>2</sub>, and a salt,
OsO(NO)(KO), of the type OsX<sub>4</sub> is formed. This salt crystallises well in light yellow
octahedra. It corresponds to <i>osmiamic acid</i>, OsO(ON)(HO), whose anhydride
[OsO(NO)]<sub>2</sub>, has the composition Os<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which equals 2Os + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> to the same extent
as the above-mentioned compound PtCO<sub>2</sub> equals Pt + CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_11_487">11</a>).</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">COPPER, SILVER, AND GOLD</span></h2>

<p>That degree of analogy and difference which exists between iron,
cobalt, and nickel repeats itself in the corresponding triad ruthenium,
rhodium, and palladium, and also in the heavy platinum metals,
osmium, iridium, and platinum. These nine metals form Group VIII.
of the elements in the periodic system, being the intermediate group
between the even elements of the large periods and the uneven, among
which we know zinc, cadmium, and mercury in Group II. Copper,
silver, and gold complete<a name="FNanchor_1_472" id="FNanchor_1_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_472" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> this transition, because their properties
place them in proximity to nickel, palladium, and platinum on the one
hand, and to zinc, cadmium, and mercury on the other. Just as Zn,
Cd, and Hg; Fe, Ru, and Os; Co, Rh, and Ir; Ni, Pd, and Pt,
resemble each  other in  many respects, so  also  do Cu, Ag, and Au.
Thus, for example, the atomic weight of copper Cu = 63, and in all its
properties it stands between Ni = 59 and Zn = 65. But as the transition
from Group VIII. to Group II., where zinc is situated, cannot be
otherwise than through Group I., so in copper there are certain properties
of the elements of Group I. Thus it gives a suboxide, Cu<sub>2</sub>O,
and salts, CuX, like the elements of Group I., although at the same
time it forms an oxide, CuO, and salts CuX<sub>2</sub>, like nickel and zinc. In
the state of the oxide, CuO, and the salts, CuX<sub>2</sub>, copper is analogous to
zinc, judging from the insolubility of the carbonates, phosphates, and
similar salts, and by the isomorphism, and other characters.<a name="FNanchor_2_473" id="FNanchor_2_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_473" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In the
cuprous salts there is undoubtedly a great resemblance to the silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
salts&mdash;thus, for example, silver chloride, AgCl, is characterised by its
insolubility and capacity of combining with ammonia, and in this respect
cuprous chloride closely resembles it, for it is also insoluble in water,
and combines with ammonia and dissolves in it, &amp;c. Its composition is
also RCl, the same as AgCl, NaCl, KCl, &amp;c., and silver in many compounds
resembles, and is even isomorphous with, sodium, so that this
again justifies their being brought together. Silver chloride, cuprous
chloride, and sodium chloride crystallise in the regular system.
Besides which, the specific heats of copper and silver require that they
should have the atomic weights ascribed to them. To the oxides Cu<sub>2</sub>O
and Ag<sub>2</sub>O there are corresponding sulphides Ag<sub>2</sub>S and Cu<sub>2</sub>S. They
both occur in nature in crystals of the rhombic system, and, what is
most important, copper glance contains an isomorphous mixture of
them both, and retains the form of copper glance with various proportions
of copper and silver, and therefore has the composition R<sub>2</sub>S
where R = Cu, Ag.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the resemblance in the atomic composition of the
cuprous compounds, CuX, and silver compounds, AgX, with the compounds
of the alkali metals KX, NaX, there is a considerable degree
of difference between these two series of elements. This difference is
clearly seen in the fact that the alkali metals belong to those elements
which combine with extreme facility with oxygen, decompose water,
and form the most alkaline bases; whilst silver and copper are
oxidised with difficulty, form less energetic oxides, and do not decompose
water, even at a rather high temperature. Moreover, they only
displace hydrogen from very few acids. The difference between them
is also seen in the dissimilarity of the properties of many of the
corresponding compounds. Thus cuprous oxide, Cu<sub>2</sub>O, and silver oxide,
Ag<sub>2</sub>O, are insoluble in water: the cuprous and silver carbonates,
chlorides, and sulphates are also sparingly soluble in water. The
oxides of silver and copper are also easily reduced to metal. This
difference in properties is in intimate relation with that difference in
the density of the metals which exists in this case. The alkali metals
belong to the lightest, and copper and silver to the heaviest, and therefore
the distance between the molecules in these metals is very dissimilar&mdash;it
is greater for the former than the latter (tables in Chapter
<a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>). From the point of view of the periodic law, this difference
between copper and silver and such elements of Group I. as potassium
and rubidium, is clearly seen from the fact that copper and silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
stand in the middle of those large periods (for example, K, Ca, Sc, Ti,
V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br) which start with
the true metals of the alkalis&mdash;that is to say, the analogy and difference
between potassium and copper are of the same nature as that between
chromium and selenium, or vanadium and arsenic.</p>

<p><i>Copper</i> is one of the few metals which have long been known in a
metallic form. The Greeks and Romans imported copper chiefly from
the island of Cyprus&mdash;whence its Latin name, <i>cuprum</i>. It was known
to the ancients before iron, and was used, especially when alloyed with
other metals, for arms and domestic utensils. That copper was known
to the ancients will be understood from the fact that it occurs, although
rarely, in a <i>native state</i>, and is easily extracted from its other natural
compounds. Among the latter are the oxygen compounds of copper.
When ignited with charcoal, they easily give up their oxygen to
it, and yield metallic copper; hydrogen also easily takes up the
oxygen from copper oxide when heated. Copper occurs in a native
state, sometimes in association with other ores, in many parts of the
Urals and in Sweden, and in considerable masses in America, especially
in the neighbourhood of the great American lakes; and also in
Chili, Japan, and China. The oxygen compounds of copper are also of
somewhat common occurrence in certain localities; in this respect
certain deposits of the Urals are especially famous. The geological
period of the Urals (Permian) is characterised by a considerable distribution
of copper ores. Copper is met with in the form of <i>cuprous
oxide</i>, or <i>suboxide of copper</i>, Cu<sub>2</sub>O, and is then known as <i>red copper
ore</i>, because it forms red masses which not unfrequently are crystallised
in the regular system. It is found much more rarely in the state of
<i>cupric oxide</i>, CuO, and is then called <i>black copper ore</i>. The most
common of the oxygenised compounds of copper are the <i>basic carbonates</i>
corresponding with the oxides. That these compounds are undoubtedly
of aqueous origin is apparent, not only from the fact that specimens
are frequently found of a gradual transition from the metallic, sulphuretted,
and oxidised copper into its various carbonates, but also from
the presence of water in their composition, and from the laminar,
reniform structure which many of them present. In this respect <i>malachite</i>
is particularly well known; it is used as a green paint and also
for ornaments, owing to the diversity of the shades of colour presented
by the different layers of deposited malachite. The composition of
malachite corresponds with the basic carbonate containing one molecule
of cupric carbonate to one of hydroxide: CuCO<sub>3</sub>,CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In this
form the copper frequently occurs in admixture with various sedimentary
rocks, forming large strata, which confirms the aqueous origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
of these compounds. There are many such localities in the Perm and
other Governments bounding the Urals. <i>Blue carbonate of copper</i>, or
<i>azurite</i>, is also often met with in the same localities; it contains the
same ingredients as malachite, but in a different proportion, its composition
being CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,2CuCO<sub>3</sub>. Both these substances may be obtained
artificially by the action of the alkali carbonates on solutions
of cupric salts at various temperatures. These native carbonates are
often used for the extraction of copper, all the more as they very
readily give metallic copper, evolving water and carbonic anhydride
when ignited, and leaving the easily-reducible cupric oxide. Copper
is, however, still more often met with in the form of the sulphides.
The sulphides of copper generally occur in chemical combination
with the sulphides of iron.<a name="FNanchor_3_474" id="FNanchor_3_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_474" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> These copper-sulphur compounds (copper
pyrites CuFeS<sub>2</sub>, variegated copper ore Cu<sub>3</sub>FeS<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.) generally occur in
veins in a rock gangue.</p>

<p><i>The extraction of copper from its oxide ores</i> does not present any
difficulty, because the copper, when ignited with charcoal and melted,
is reduced from the impurities which accompany it. This mode of
smelting copper ores is carried on in cupola or cylindrical furnaces,
fluxes forming a slag being added to the mixture of ore and charcoal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
The smelted copper still contains sulphur, iron, and other metallic
impurities, from which it is freed by fusion in reverberatory furnaces,
with access of air to the surface of the molten metal, as the iron and
sulphur are more easily oxidised than the copper. The iron then
separates as oxides, which collect in the slag.<a name="FNanchor_4_475" id="FNanchor_4_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_475" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span></p>

<p>Copper is characterised by its red colour, which distinguishes it
from all other metals. Pure copper is soft, and may be beaten out by
a hammer at the ordinary temperature, and when hot may be rolled
into very thin sheets. Extremely thin leaves of copper transmit a
green light. The tenacity of copper is also considerable, and next to
iron it is one of the most durable metals in this respect. Copper wire
of 1 sq. millimetre in section only breaks under a weight of 45 kilograms.
The specific gravity of copper is 8·8, unless it contains cavities due to the
fact that molten copper absorbs oxygen from the air, which is disengaged
on cooling, and therefore gives a porous mass whose density is
much less. Rolled copper, and also that which is deposited by the electric
current, has a comparatively high density. Copper melts at a bright
red heat, about 1050°, although below the temperature at which many
kinds of cast iron melt. At a high temperature it is converted into
vapour, which communicates a green colour to the flame. Both native
copper and that cooled from a molten state crystallise in regular
octahedra. Copper is not oxidised in dry air at the ordinary temperature,
but when calcined it becomes coated with a layer of oxide, and it
does not burn even at the highest temperature. Copper, when calcined
in air, forms either the red cuprous oxide or the black cupric oxide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
according to the temperature and quantity of air supplied. In air
at the ordinary temperature, copper&mdash;as everyone knows&mdash;becomes
coated with a brown layer of oxides or a green coating of basic salts,
due to the action of the damp air containing carbonic acid. If this
action continue for a prolonged time, the copper is covered with a thick
coating of basic carbonate, or the so-called verdigris (the <i>ærugo nobilis</i>
of ancient statues). This is due to the fact that copper, although
scarcely capable of oxidising by itself,<a name="FNanchor_5_476" id="FNanchor_5_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_476" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> <i>in the presence of water and
acids</i>&mdash;even very feeble acids, like carbonic acid&mdash;<i>absorbs oxygen from
the air and forms salts</i>, which is a very characteristic property of it (and
of lead).<a name="FNanchor_6_477" id="FNanchor_6_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_477" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> <i>Copper does not decompose water</i>, and therefore does not disengage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
hydrogen from it either at the ordinary or at high temperatures.
Nor does copper liberate hydrogen from the oxygen acids; these act on
it in two ways: they either give up a portion of their oxygen, forming
lower grades of oxidation, or else only react in the presence of
air. Thus, when nitric acid acts on copper it evolves nitric oxide, the
copper being oxidised at the expense of the nitric acid. In the same
way copper converts sulphuric acid into the lower grade of oxidation&mdash;into
sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>. In these cases the copper is oxidised
to copper oxide, which combines with the excess of acid taken, and
therefore forms a cupric salt, CuX<sub>2</sub>. Dilute nitric acid does not act
on copper at the ordinary temperature, but when heated it reacts
with great ease; dilute sulphuric acid does not act on copper except
in presence of air.</p>

<p>Both the oxides of copper, Cu<sub>2</sub>O and CuO, are unacted on by
air, and, as already mentioned, they both occur in nature.<a name="FNanchor_6_BIS_478" id="FNanchor_6_BIS_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_BIS_478" class="fnanchor">[6 bis]</a> However,
in the majority of cases copper is obtained in the form of
cupric oxide and its salts&mdash;and the copper compounds used industrially
generally belong to this type. This is due to the fact that the
<i>cuprous compounds absorb oxygen</i> from the air and pass into cupric
compounds. The cupric compounds may serve as the source for the
preparation of cuprous oxide, because many reducing agents are
capable of deoxidising the oxide into the suboxide. Organic substances
are most generally employed for this purpose, and especially
saccharine substances, which are able, in the presence of alkalis, to
undergo oxidation at the expense of the oxygen of the cupric oxide,
and to give acids which combine with the alkali: 2CuO - O = Cu<sub>2</sub>O.
In this case the deoxidation of the copper may be carried further and
metallic copper obtained, if only the reaction be aided by heat. Thus,
for example, a fine powder of metallic copper may be obtained by heating
an ammoniacal solution of cupric oxide with caustic potash
and grape sugar. But if the reducing action of the saccharine
substance proceed in the presence of a sufficient quantity of alkali in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
solution, and at not too high a temperature, cuprous oxide is obtained.
To see this reaction clearly, it is not sufficient to take any
cupric salt, because the alkali necessary for the reaction might precipitate
cupric oxide&mdash;it is necessary to add previously some substance
which will prevent this precipitation.  Among such substances,
tartaric acid, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, is one of the best.  In the presence of a sufficient
quantity of tartaric acid, any amount of alkali may be added to a
solution of cupric salt without producing a precipitate, because a soluble
double salt of cupric oxide and alkali is then formed. If glucose (for
instance, honey or molasses) be added to such an alkaline tartaric
solution, and the temperature be slightly raised, it first gives a yellow
precipitate (this is cuprous hydroxide, CuHO), and then, on boiling,
a red precipitate of (anhydrous) cuprous oxide. If such a mixture
be left for a long time at the ordinary temperature, it deposits well-formed
crystals of anhydrous cuprous oxide belonging to the regular
system.<a name="FNanchor_7_479" id="FNanchor_7_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_479" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>Cupric chloride, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, when ignited, gives <i>cuprous chloride</i>, CuCl&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the salt corresponding with suboxide of copper&mdash;and therefore
cuprous chloride is always formed when copper enters into reaction
with chlorine at a high temperature. Thus, for example, when copper
is calcined with mercuric chloride, it forms cuprous chloride and vapours
of mercury. The same substance is obtained on heating metallic
copper in hydrochloric acid, hydrogen being disengaged; but this reaction
only proceeds with finely-divided copper, as hydrochloric acid acts
very feebly on compact masses of copper, and, in the presence of air,
gives cupric chloride. The green solution of cupric chloride is decolorised
by metallic copper, cuprous chloride being formed; but this
reaction is only accomplished with ease when the solution is very concentrated
and in the presence of an excess of hydrochloric acid to
dissolve the cuprous chloride. The addition of water to the solution
precipitates the cuprous chloride, because it is less soluble in
dilute than in strong hydrochloric acid. Many reducing agents which
are able to take up half the oxygen from cupric oxide are able, in the
presence of hydrochloric acid, to form cuprous chloride. Stannous
salts, sulphurous anhydride, alkali sulphites, phosphorous and hypophosphorous
acids, and many similar reducing agents, act in this
manner. The usual method of preparing cuprous chloride consists in
passing sulphurous anhydride into a very strong solution of cupric
chloride: 2CuCl<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = 2CuCl + 2HCl + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Cuprous
chloride forms colourless cubic crystals which are insoluble in water.
It is easily fusible, and even volatile. Under the action of oxidising
agents, it passes into the cupric salt, and it absorbs oxygen from moist
air, forming cupric oxychloride, Cu<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>O. <i>Aqueous ammonia</i> easily
<i>dissolves</i> cuprous chloride as well as cuprous oxide; the solution also
turns blue on exposure to the air. Thus an ammoniacal solution of
cuprous chloride serves as an excellent absorbent for oxygen; but this
solution absorbs not only oxygen, but also certain other gases&mdash;for
example, carbonic oxide and acetylene.<a name="FNanchor_8_480" id="FNanchor_8_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_480" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>When copper is oxidised with a considerable quantity of oxygen at
a high temperature, or at the ordinary temperature in the presence of
acids, and also when it decomposes acids, converting them into lower
grades of oxidation (for example, when submitted to the action of
nitric and sulphuric acids), it forms <i>cupric oxide</i>, CuO, or, in the
presence of acids, cupric salts. Copper rust, or that black mass which
forms on the surface of copper when it is calcined, consists of cupric
oxide. The coating of the oxidised copper is very easily separated
from the metallic copper, because it is brittle and very easily peels off,
when it is struck or immersed in water. Many copper salts (for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
instance, the nitrite and carbonate) leave oxide of copper<a name="FNanchor_8_BIS_481" id="FNanchor_8_BIS_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_BIS_481" class="fnanchor">[8 bis]</a> in the
form of friable black powder, after being ignited. If the ignition be
carried further, Cu<sub>2</sub>O may be formed from the CuO.<a name="FNanchor_8_TRI_482" id="FNanchor_8_TRI_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_TRI_482" class="fnanchor">[8 tri]</a> Anhydrous
cupric oxide is very easily dissolved in acids, forming cupric salts, CuX<sub>2</sub>.
They are analogous to the salts MgX<sub>2</sub>, ZnX<sub>2</sub>, NiX<sub>2</sub>, FeX<sub>2</sub>, in many
respects. On adding potassium or ammonium hydroxide to a solution
of a cupric salt, it forms a gelatinous blue precipitate of the hydrated
oxide of copper, CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, insoluble in water. The resultant precipitate
<i>is re-dissolved by an excess of ammonia</i>, and gives a very beautiful
azure blue solution, of so intense a colour that the presence of small
traces of cupric salts may be discovered by this means.<a name="FNanchor_9_483" id="FNanchor_9_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_483" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> An excess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
potassium or sodium hydroxide does not dissolve cupric hydroxide.
A hot solution gives a black precipitate of the anhydrous oxide
instead of the blue precipitate, and the precipitate of the hydroxide
of copper becomes granular, and turns black when the solution
is heated. This is due to the fact that the blue hydroxide is
exceedingly unstable, and when slightly heated it loses the elements
of water and gives the black anhydrous cupric oxide: CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
= CuO + H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Cupric oxide fuses at a strong heat, and on cooling forms a heavy
crystalline mass, which is black, opaque, and somewhat tenacious. It
is a feebly energetic base, so that not only do the oxides of the metals
of the alkalis and alkaline earths displace it from its compounds, but
even such oxides as those of lead and silver precipitate it from solutions,
which is partially due to these oxides being soluble, although but slightly
so, in water. However, cupric oxide, and especially the hydroxide,
easily combines with even the least energetic acids, and does not give
any compounds with bases; but, on the other hand, <i>it easily forms
basic salts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_BIS_484" id="FNanchor_9_BIS_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_BIS_484" class="fnanchor">[9 bis]</a> and in this respect outstrips magnesium and recalls the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
oxides of lead or mercury. Hence the hydroxide of copper dissolves in
solutions of neutral cupric salts. The cupric salts are generally blue or
green, because cupric hydroxide itself is coloured. But some of the
salts in the anhydrous state are colourless.<a name="FNanchor_10_485" id="FNanchor_10_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_485" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>The commonest normal salt is <i>blue vitriol</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the normal cupric
sulphate. It generally contains five molecules of water of crystallisation,
CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O. It forms the product of the action of strong sulphuric
acid on copper, sulphurous anhydride being evolved. The same
salt is obtained in practice by carefully roasting sulphuretted ores of
copper, and also by the action of water holding oxygen in solution on
them: CuS + O<sub>4</sub> = CuSO<sub>4</sub>. This salt forms a by-product, obtained in
gold refineries, when the silver is precipitated from the sulphuric acid
solution by means of copper. It is also obtained by pouring dilute
sulphuric acid over sheet copper in the presence of air, or by heating
cupric oxide or carbonate in sulphuric acid. The crystals of this salt
belong to the triclinic system, have a specific gravity of 2·19, are of a
beautiful blue colour, and give a solution of the same colour. 100
parts of water at 0° dissolve 15, at 25° 23, and at 100° about 45 parts
of cupric sulphate, CuSO<sub>4</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_10_BIS_486" id="FNanchor_10_BIS_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_BIS_486" class="fnanchor">[10 bis]</a> At 100° this salt loses a portion of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
water of crystallisation, which it only parts with entirely at a high
temperature (220°) and then gives a white powder of the anhydrous
sulphate; and the latter, on further calcination, loses the elements of
sulphuric anhydride, leaving cupric oxide, like all the cupric salts. The
anhydrous (colourless) cupric sulphate is sometimes used for absorbing
water; it turns blue in the process. It offers the advantage that it
retains both hydrochloric acid and water, but not carbonic anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_11_487" id="FNanchor_11_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_487" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Cupric sulphate is used for steeping seed corn; this is said to prevent
the growth of certain parasites on the plants. In the arts a considerable
quantity of cupric sulphate is also used in the preparation of other
copper salts&mdash;for instance, of certain pigments<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_488" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_488" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a>&mdash;and a particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
large quantity is used <i>in the galvanoplastic process</i>, which consists in
the deposition of copper from a solution of cupric sulphate by the
action of a galvanic current, when the metallic copper is deposited
on the negative pole and takes the shape of the latter. The description
of the processes of galvanoplastic art introduced by Jacobi
in St. Petersburg forms a part of applied physics, and will not be
touched on here, and we will only mention that, although first introduced
for small articles, it is now used for such articles as type moulds
(<i>clichés</i>), for maps, prints, &amp;c., and also for large statues, and for the
deposition of iron, zinc, nickel, gold, silver, &amp;c. on other metals and
materials. The beginning of the application of the galvanic current to
the practical extraction of metals from solutions has also been established,
especially since the dynamo-electric machines of Gramme,
Siemens, and others have rendered it possible to cheaply convert the
mechanical motion of the steam engine into an electric current. It is
to be expected that the application of the electric current, which has
long since given such important results in chemistry, will, in the near
future, play an important part in technical processes, the example being
shown by electric lighting.</p>

<p><i>The alloys of copper</i> with certain metals, and especially with zinc
and tin, are easily formed by directly melting the metals together.
They are easily cast into moulds, forged, and worked like copper,
whilst they are much more durable in the air, and are therefore frequently
used in the arts. Even the ancients used exclusively alloys
of copper, and not pure copper, but its alloys with tin or different
kinds of bronze (Chapter XVIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_35_164">35</a>). The alloys of copper with
zinc are called <i>brass</i> or &lsquo;yellow metal.&rsquo; Brass contains about 32 p.c. of
zinc; generally, however, it does not contain more than 65 p.c. of
copper. The remainder is composed of lead and tin, which usually
occur, although in small quantities, in brass. Yellow metal contains
about 40 p.c. of zinc.<a name="FNanchor_12_489" id="FNanchor_12_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_489" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The addition of zinc to copper changes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
colour of the latter to a considerable degree; with a certain amount of
zinc the colour of the copper becomes yellow, and with a still larger
proportion of zinc an alloy is formed which has a greenish tint. In those
alloys of zinc and copper which contain a larger amount of zinc than
of copper, the yellow colour disappears and is replaced by a greyish
colour. But when the amount of zinc is diminished to about 20 p.c.,
the alloy is red and hard, and is called &lsquo;tombac.&rsquo; A contraction takes
place in alloying copper with zinc, so that the volume of the alloy is
less than that of either metal individually. The zinc volatilises on
prolonged heating at a high temperature and the excess of metallic
copper remains behind. When heated in the air, the zinc oxidises
before the copper, so that all the zinc alloyed with copper may be
removed from the copper by this means. An important property of
brass containing about 30 p.c. of zinc is that it is soft and malleable in
the cold, but becomes somewhat brittle when heated. We may also
mention that ordinary copper coins contain, in order to render them
hard, tin, zinc, and iron (Cu = 95 p.c.); that it is now customary to add
a small amount of phosphorus to copper and bronze, for the same purpose;
and also that copper is added to silver and gold in coining, &amp;c.
to render it hard; moreover, in Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium,
and other countries, a silver-white alloy (melchior, German silver, &amp;c.),
for base coinage and other purposes, is prepared from brass and nickel
(from 10 to 20 p.c. of nickel; 20 to 30 p.c. zinc: 50 to 70 p.c. copper),
or directly from copper and nickel, or, more rarely, from an alloy containing
silver, nickel, and copper.<a name="FNanchor_12_BIS_490" id="FNanchor_12_BIS_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_BIS_490" class="fnanchor">[12 bis]</a></p>

<p>Copper, in its cuprous compounds, is so analogous to <i>silver</i>, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
were there no cupric compounds, or if silver gave stable compounds
of the higher oxide, AgO, the resemblance would be as close as that
between chlorine and bromine or zinc and cadmium; but silver
compounds corresponding to AgO are quite unknown. Although
silver peroxide&mdash;which was regarded as AgO, but which Berthelot
(1880) recognised as the sesquioxide Ag<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&mdash;is known, still it does
not form any true salts, and consequently cannot be placed along
with cupric oxide.  In distinction to copper, silver as a metal does
not oxidise under the influence of heat; and its oxides, Ag<sub>2</sub>O and
Ag<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, easily lose oxygen (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_8_TRI_482">8 tri</a>). Silver does <i>not oxidise</i> in
air at the ordinary pressure, and is therefore classed among the
so-called <i>noble metals</i>. It has a white colour, which is much purer
than that of any other known metal, especially when the metal is chemically
pure. In the arts silver is always used alloyed, because chemically-pure
silver is so soft that it wears exceedingly easily, whilst when
fused with a small amount of copper, it becomes very hard, without
losing its colour.<a name="FNanchor_13_491" id="FNanchor_13_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_491" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a><br /><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>Silver occurs in <i>nature</i>, both in a native state and in certain compounds.
Native silver, however, is of rather rare occurrence. A far
greater quantity of silver occurs in combination with sulphur, and
especially in the form of <i>silver sulphide</i>, Ag<sub>2</sub>S, with lead sulphide
or copper sulphide, or the ores of various other metals. The largest
amount of silver is extracted from the lead in which it occurs. If this
lead be calcined in the presence of air, it oxidises, and the resultant
lead oxide, PbO (&lsquo;litharge&rsquo; or &lsquo;silberglätte,&rsquo; as it is called), melts into
a mobile liquid, which is easily removed. The silver remains in an
unoxidised metallic state.<a name="FNanchor_14_492" id="FNanchor_14_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_492" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This process is called <i>cupellation</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>Commercial silver generally contains copper, and, more rarely, other
metallic impurities also. Chemically <i>pure silver</i> is obtained either by
cupellation or by subjecting ordinary silver to the following treatment.
The silver is first dissolved in nitric acid, which converts it and the
copper into nitrates, Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and AgNO<sub>3</sub>; hydrochloric acid is then
added to the resultant solution (green, owing to the presence of the
cupric salt), which is considerably diluted with water in order to retain
the lead chloride in solution if the silver contained lead. The copper
and many other metals remain in solution, whilst the silver is precipitated
as silver chloride. The precipitate is allowed to settle, and the
liquid is decanted off; the precipitate is then washed and fused with
sodium carbonate. A double decomposition then takes place, sodium
chloride and silver carbonate being formed; but the latter decomposes
into metallic silver, because the silver oxide is decomposed by heat:
Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = Ag<sub>2</sub> + O + CO<sub>2</sub>. The silver chloride may also be mixed
with metallic zinc, sulphuric acid, and water, and left for some time,
when the zinc removes the chlorine from the silver chloride and precipitates
the silver as a powder. This finely-divided silver is called
&lsquo;molecular silver.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_15_493" id="FNanchor_15_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_493" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>Chemically-pure silver has an exceeding pure white colour, and a
specific gravity of 10·5. Solid silver is lighter than the molten metal,
and therefore a piece of silver floats on the latter. The fusing-point
of silver is about 950° C., and at the high temperature attained
by the combustion of detonating gas it volatilises.<a name="FNanchor_16_494" id="FNanchor_16_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_494" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> By employing
silver reduced from silver chloride by milk sugar and caustic potash,
and distilling it, Stas obtained silver purer than that obtained by any
other means; in fact, this was perfectly pure silver. The vapour of
silver has a very beautiful green colour, which is seen when a silver
wire is placed in an oxyhydrogen flame.<a name="FNanchor_17_495" id="FNanchor_17_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_495" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>It has long been known (Wöhler) that when nitrate of silver,
AgNO<sub>3</sub>, reacts as an oxidising agent upon citrates and tartrates, it is
able under certain conditions to give either a salt of suboxide of silver
(see Note <a href="#Footnote_19_499">19</a>) or a red solution, or to give a precipitate of metallic
silver reduced at the expense of the organic substances. In 1889 Carey
Lea, in his researches on this class of reactions, showed that <i>soluble</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
<i>silver</i> is here formed, which he called <i>allotropic silver</i>. It may be
obtained by taking 200 c.c. of a 10 per cent. solution of AgNO<sub>3</sub> and
quickly adding a mixture (neutralised with NaHO) of 200 c.c. of a
30 per cent. solution of FeSO<sub>4</sub> and 200 c.c. of a 40 per cent. solution
of sodium citrate. A lilac precipitate is obtained, which is collected
on a filter (the precipitate becomes blue) and washed with a solution of
NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>. It then becomes soluble in pure water, forming a red
perfectly transparent solution from which the dissolved silver is precipitated
on the addition of many soluble foreign bodies. Some of the
latter&mdash;for instance, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, alkaline sulphates, nitrates, and citrates&mdash;give
a precipitate which re-dissolves in pure water, whilst others&mdash;for
instance, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, FeSO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, AgNO<sub>3</sub>, Ba(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and many others&mdash;convert
the precipitated silver into a new variety, which, although no
longer soluble in water, regains its solubility in a solution of borax
and is soluble in ammonia. Both the soluble and insoluble silver are
rapidly converted into the ordinary grey-metallic variety by sulphuric
acid, although nothing is given off in the reaction; the same change
takes place on ignition, but in this case CO<sub>2</sub> is disengaged; the latter
is formed from the organic substances which remain (to the amount of
3 per cent.) in the modified silver (they are not removed by soaking in
alcohol or water). If the precipitated silver be slightly washed and
laid in a smooth thin layer on paper or glass, it is seen that the soluble
variety is red when moist and a fine blue colour when dry, whilst the insoluble
variety has a blue reflex. Besides these, under special conditions<a name="FNanchor_18_496" id="FNanchor_18_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_496" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
a golden yellow variety may be obtained, which gives a brilliant golden
yellow coating on glass; but it is easily converted into the ordinary
grey-metallic state by friction or trituration. There is no doubt<a name="FNanchor_18_BIS_497" id="FNanchor_18_BIS_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_BIS_497" class="fnanchor">[18 bis]</a>
that there is the same relation between ordinary silver which is perfectly
insoluble in water and the varieties of silver obtained by Carey
Lea<a name="FNanchor_18_TRI_498" id="FNanchor_18_TRI_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_TRI_498" class="fnanchor">[18 tri]</a> as there is between quartz and soluble silica or between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
CuS and As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> in their ordinary insoluble forms and in the state of
the colloid solution of their hydrosols (<i>see</i> Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_57_104">57</a>, and
Chapter XVII., Note <a href="#Footnote_25_BIS_95">25 bis</a>). Here, however, an important step in
advance has been made in this respect, that we are dealing with the
solution of a simple body, and moreover of a metal&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of a particularly
characteristic state of matter. And as boron, gold, and certain
other simple bodies have already been obtained in a soluble (colloid)
form, and as numerous organic compounds (albuminous substances,
gum, cellulose, starch, &amp;c.) and inorganic substances are also known in
this form, it might be said that the colloid state (of hydrogels and hydrosols)
can be acquired, if not by every substance, at all events by substances
of most varied chemical character under particular conditions
of formation from solutions. And this being the case, we may hope
that a further study of soluble colloid compounds, which apparently
present various transitions towards emulsions, may throw a new light
upon the complex question of solutions, which forms one of the problems
of the present epoch of chemical science. Moreover, we may remark that
Spring (1890) clearly proved the colloid state of soluble silver by means
of dialysis as it did not pass through the membrane.</p>

<p>As regards the capacity of silver for chemical reactions, it is
remarkable for its small capacity for combination with oxygen and for
its considerable energy of combination with sulphur, iodine, and certain
kindred non-metals. <i>Silver does not oxidise</i> at any temperature,
and its oxide, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, is decomposed by heat. It is also a very important
fact that silver is not oxidised by oxygen either in the presence of
alkalis, even at exceedingly high temperatures, or in the presence of
acids&mdash;at least, of dilute acids&mdash;which properties render it a very
important metal in chemical industry for the fusion of alkalis, and also
for many purposes in everyday life; for instance, for making spoons,
salt-cellars, &amp;c. Ozone, however, oxidises it. Of all acids nitric acid
has the greatest action on silver. The reaction is accompanied by the
formation of oxides of nitrogen and silver nitrate, AgNO<sub>3</sub>, which
dissolves in water and does not, therefore, hinder the further action of
the acid on the metal. The halogen acids, especially hydriodic acid,
act on silver, hydrogen being evolved; but this action soon stops,
owing to the halogen compounds of silver being insoluble in water and
only very slightly soluble in acids; they therefore preserve the remaining
mass of metal from the further action of the acid; in consequence of
this the action of the halogen acids is only distinctly seen with finely-divided
silver. Sulphuric acid acts on silver in the same manner that
it does on copper, only it must be concentrated and at a higher
temperature. Sulphurous anhydride, and not hydrogen, is then evolved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
but there is no action at the ordinary temperature, even in the presence
of air. Among the various salts, sodium chloride (in the presence of
moisture, air, and carbonic acid) and potassium cyanide (in the presence
of air) act on silver more decidedly than any others, converting it respectively
into silver chloride and a double cyanide.</p>

<p>Although silver does not directly combine with oxygen, still three
different grades of combination with oxygen may be obtained indirectly
from the salts of silver. They are all, however, unstable, and
decompose into oxygen and metallic silver when ignited. These three
oxides of silver have the following composition: <i>silver suboxide</i>,
Ag<sub>4</sub>O,<a name="FNanchor_19_499" id="FNanchor_19_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_499" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> corresponding with the (little investigated) suboxides of the
alkali metals; <i>silver oxide</i>, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, corresponding with the oxides of the
alkali metals and the ordinary salts of silver, AgX; and <i>silver peroxide</i>,
AgO,<a name="FNanchor_19_BIS_500" id="FNanchor_19_BIS_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_BIS_500" class="fnanchor">[19 bis]</a> or, judging from Berthelot's researches, Ag<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. <i>Silver oxide</i>
is obtained as a brown precipitate (which when dried does not contain
water) by adding potassium hydroxide to a solution of a silver salt&mdash;for
example, of silver nitrate. The precipitate formed seems, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
to be an hydroxide, AgHO, <i>i.e.</i> AgNO<sub>3</sub> + KHO = KNO<sub>3</sub> + AgHO,
and the formation of the anhydrous oxide, 2AgHO = Ag<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O,
may be compared with the formation of the anhydrous cupric oxide by
the action of potassium hydroxide on hot cupric solutions. Silver
hydroxide decomposes into water and silver oxide, even at low
temperatures; at least, the hydroxide no longer exists at 60°, but
forms the anhydrous oxide, Ag<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_19_TRI_501" id="FNanchor_19_TRI_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_TRI_501" class="fnanchor">[19 tri]</a> Silver oxide is almost
insoluble in water; but, nevertheless, it is undoubtedly a rather
powerful basic oxide, because it displaces the oxides of many metals
from their soluble salts, and saturates such acids as nitric acid,
forming with them neutral salts, which do not act on litmus paper.<a name="FNanchor_20_502" id="FNanchor_20_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_502" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Undoubtedly water dissolves a small quantity of silver oxide,
which explains the possibility of its action on solutions of salts&mdash;for
example, on solutions of cupric salts. Water in which silver oxide
is shaken up has a distinctly alkaline reaction. The oxide is distinguished
by its great instability when heated, so that it loses all its
oxygen when slightly heated. Hydrogen reduces it at about 80°.<a name="FNanchor_20_BIS_503" id="FNanchor_20_BIS_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_BIS_503" class="fnanchor">[20 bis]</a>
The feebleness of the affinity of silver for oxygen is shown by the fact
that silver oxide decomposes under the action of light, so that it must be
kept in opaque vessels. The silver <i>salts</i> are colourless and decompose
when heated, leaving metallic silver if the elements of the acid are
volatile.<a name="FNanchor_20_TRI_504" id="FNanchor_20_TRI_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_TRI_504" class="fnanchor">[20 tri]</a> They have a peculiar metallic taste, and are exceedingly
poisonous; the majority of them are acted on by light, especially in
the presence of organic substances, which are then oxidised. The
alkaline carbonates give a white precipitate of silver carbonate,
Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which is insoluble in water, but soluble in ammonia and
ammonium carbonate. Aqueous ammonia, added to a solution of a
normal silver salt, first acts like potassium hydroxide, but the precipitate
dissolves in an excess of the reagent, like the precipitate of cupric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
hydroxide.<a name="FNanchor_21_505" id="FNanchor_21_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_505" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Silver oxalate and the halogen compounds of silver are
insoluble in water; hydrochloric acid and soluble chlorides give,
as already repeatedly observed, a white precipitate of silver chloride
in solutions of silver salts. Potassium iodide gives a yellowish
precipitate of silver iodide. Zinc separates all the silver in a metallic
form from solutions of silver salts. Many other metals and reducing
agents&mdash;for example, organic substances&mdash;also reduce silver from the
solutions of its salts.</p>

<p><i>Silver nitrate</i>, AgNO<sub>3</sub>, is known by the name of lunar caustic
(or <i>lapis infernalis</i>); it is obtained by dissolving metallic silver
in nitric acid. If the silver be impure, the resultant solution will
contain a mixture of the nitrates of copper and silver. If this mixture
be evaporated to dryness and the residue carefully fused at an
incipient red heat, all the cupric nitrate is decomposed, whilst the
greater part of the silver nitrate remains unchanged. On treating
the fused mass with water the latter is dissolved, whilst the cupric
oxide remains insoluble. If a certain amount of silver oxide be added
to the solution containing the nitrates of silver and copper, it displaces
all the cupric oxide. In this case it is of course not necessary to take
pure silver oxide, but only to pour off some of the solution and to add
potassium hydroxide to one portion, and to mix the resultant precipitate
of the hydroxides, Cu(OH)<sub>2</sub> and AgOH, with the remaining
portion.<a name="FNanchor_22_506" id="FNanchor_22_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_506" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> By these methods all the copper can be easily removed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
pure silver nitrate obtained (its solution is colourless, while the presence
of Cu renders it blue), which may be ultimately purified by crystallisation.
It crystallises in colourless transparent prismatic plates, which
are not acted on by air. They are anhydrous. Its sp. gr. is 4·34; it
dissolves in half its weight of water at the ordinary temperature.<a name="FNanchor_22_BIS_507" id="FNanchor_22_BIS_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_BIS_507" class="fnanchor">[22 bis]</a>
The pure salt is not acted on by light, but it easily acts in an oxidising
manner on the majority of organic substances, which it generally
blackens. This is due to the fact that the organic substance is oxidised
by the silver nitrate, which is reduced to metallic silver; the latter is
thus obtained in a finely-divided state, which causes the black stain.
This peculiarity is taken advantage of for marking linen. Silver nitrate
is for the same reason used for <i>cauterising wounds</i> and various growths
on the body. Here again it acts by virtue of its oxidising capacity in
destroying the organic matter, which it oxidises, as is seen from the
separation of a coating of black metallic powdery silver from the part
cauterised.<a name="FNanchor_22_TRI_508" id="FNanchor_22_TRI_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_TRI_508" class="fnanchor">[22 tri]</a> From the description of the preparation of silver nitrate
it will have been seen that this salt, which fuses at 218°, does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
decompose at an incipient red heat; when cast into sticks it is usually
employed for cauterising. On further heating, the fused salt undergoes
decomposition, first forming silver nitrite and then metallic silver.
With ammonia, silver nitrate forms, on evaporation of the solution,
colourless crystals containing AgNO<sub>3</sub>,2HN<sub>3</sub> (Marignac). In general
the salts of silver, like cuprous, cupric, zinc, &amp;c. salts, are able to give
several compounds with ammonia; for example, silver nitrate in a dry
state absorbs three molecules (Rose). The ammonia is generally easily
expelled from these compounds by the action of heat.</p>

<p>Nitrate of silver easily forms double salts like AgNO<sub>3</sub>2NaNO<sub>3</sub> and
AgNO<sub>3</sub>KNO<sub>3</sub>. Silver nitrate under the action of water and a halogen
gives nitric acid (<i>see</i> Vol. I. p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_280">280</a>, formation of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), a halogen salt of
silver, and a silver salt of an oxygen acid of the halogen. Thus, for
example, a solution of chlorine in water, when mixed with a solution of
silver nitrate, gives silver chloride and chlorate. It is here evident that
the reaction of the silver nitrate is identical with the reaction of the
caustic alkalis, as the nitric acid is all set free and the silver oxide only
reacts in exactly the same way in which aqueous potash acts on free
chlorine. Hence the reaction may be expressed in the following
manner: 6AgNO<sub>3</sub> + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 5AgCl + AgClO<sub>3</sub> + 6NHO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Silver nitrate, like the nitrates of the alkalis, does not contain any
water of crystallisation. Moreover the other salts of silver almost
always separate out without any water of crystallisation. The silver
salts are further characterised by the fact that they <i>give neither
basic nor acid salts</i>, owing to which the formation of silver salts
generally forms the means of determining the true composition of
acids&mdash;thus, to any acid H<sub>n</sub>X there corresponds a salt Ag<sub>n</sub>X&mdash;for
instance, Ag<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (Chapter XIX., Note <a href="#Footnote_15_220">15</a>).</p>

<p><i>Silver</i> gives insoluble and exceedingly stable <i>compounds with the
halogens</i>. They are obtained by double decomposition with great
facility whenever a silver salt comes in contact with halogen salts.
Solutions of nitrate, sulphate, and all other kindred salts of silver give
a precipitate of silver chloride or iodide in solutions of chlorides and
iodides and of the halogen acids, because the halogen salts of silver are
insoluble both in water<a name="FNanchor_23_509" id="FNanchor_23_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_509" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and in other acids. <i>Silver chloride</i>, AgCl, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
then obtained as a white flocculent precipitate, silver bromide forms a
yellowish precipitate, and silver iodide has a very distinct yellow
colour. These halogen compounds sometimes occur in nature; they
are formed by a dry method&mdash;by the action of halogen compounds on
silver compounds, especially under the influence of heat. Silver chloride
easily fuses at 451° on cooling from a molten state; it forms
a somewhat soft horn-like mass which can be cut with a knife
and is known as <i>horn silver</i>. It volatilises at a higher temperature.
Its ammoniacal solution, on the evaporation of the ammonia,
deposits crystalline chloride of silver, in octahedra. Bromide and
iodide of silver also appear in forms of the regular system, so that in
this respect the halogen salts of silver resemble the halogen salts of the
alkali metals.<a name="FNanchor_24_510" id="FNanchor_24_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_510" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a><br /><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>Silver chloride may be decomposed, with the separation of silver
oxide, by heating it with a solution of an alkali, and if an organic
substance be added to the alkali the chloride can easily be reduced o
metallic silver, the silver oxide being reduced in the oxidation of the
organic substance. Iron, zinc, and many other metals reduce silver
chloride in the presence of water. Cuprous and mercurous chlorides
and many organic substances are also able to reduce the silver from
chloride of silver. This shows the rather easy decomposability of the
halogen compounds of silver. Silver iodide is much more stable in this
respect than the chloride. The same is also observed with respect to
the <i>action of light</i> upon moist AgCl. White silver chloride soon acquires
a violet colour when exposed to the action of light, and especially
under the direct action of the sun's rays. After being acted upon
by light it is no longer entirely soluble in ammonia, but leaves
metallic silver undissolved, from which it might be assumed that the
action of light consisted in the decomposition of the silver chloride
into chlorine and metallic silver and in fact the silver chloride becomes
in time darker and darker. Silver bromide and iodide are much
more slowly acted on by light, and, according to certain observations,
when pure they are even quite unacted on; at least they do not change
in weight,<a name="FNanchor_24_BIS_511" id="FNanchor_24_BIS_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_BIS_511" class="fnanchor">[24 bis]</a> so that if they are acted on by light, the change they
undergo must be one of a change in the structure of their parts and not
of decomposition, as it is in silver chloride. The silver chloride under
the action of light changes in weight, which indicates the formation of
a volatile product, and the deposition of metallic silver on dissolving
in ammonia shows the loss of chlorine. The change does actually
occur under the action of light, but the decomposition does not go
as far as into chlorine and silver, but only to the formation of a subchloride
of silver, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl, which is of a brown colour and is easily decomposed
into metallic silver and silver chloride, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl = AgCl + Ag.
This change of the chemical composition and structure of the halogen
salts of silver under the action of light forms the basis of <i>photography</i>,
because the halogen compounds of silver, after having been exposed to
light, give a precipitate of finely-divided silver, of a black colour,
when treated with reducing agents.<a name="FNanchor_25_512" id="FNanchor_25_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_512" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>The insolubility of the halogen compounds of silver forms the
basis of many methods used in practical chemistry. Thus by means of
this reaction it is possible to obtain salts of other acids from a halogen
salt of a given metal, for instance, RCl<sub>2</sub> + 2AgNO<sub>3</sub> = R(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2AgCl.
The formation of the halogen compounds of silver is very frequently
used in the investigation of organic substances; for example, if any
product of metalepsis containing iodine or chlorine be heated with a
silver salt or silver oxide, the silver combines with the halogen and
gives a halogen salt, whilst the elements previously combined with the
silver replace the halogen. For instance, ethylene dibromide, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>,
is transformed into ethylene diacetate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, and silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
bromide by heating it with silver acetate, 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Ag. The insolubility
of the halogen compounds of silver is still more frequently taken advantage
of in determining the amount of silver and halogen in a given
solution. If it is required, for instance, to determine the quantity of
chlorine present in the form of a metallic chloride in a given solution,
a solution of silver nitrate is added to it so long as it gives a precipitate.
On <i>shaking or stirring</i> the liquid, the silver chloride easily
settles in the form of heavy flakes. It is possible in this way to
precipitate the whole of the chlorine from a solution, without adding
an excess of silver nitrate, since it can be easily seen whether the
addition of a fresh quantity of silver nitrate produces a precipitate in
the clear liquid. In this manner it is possible to add to a solution
containing chlorine, as much silver as is required for its entire precipitation,
and to calculate the amount of chlorine previously in solution
from the amount of the solution of silver nitrate consumed, if the
quantity of silver nitrate in this solution has been previously determined.<a name="FNanchor_25_BIS_513" id="FNanchor_25_BIS_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_BIS_513" class="fnanchor">[25 bis]</a>
The atomic proportions and preliminary experiments with
a pure salt&mdash;for example, with sodium chloride&mdash;will give the amount
of chlorine from the quantity of silver nitrate. Details of these
methods will be found in works on analytical chemistry.<a name="FNanchor_25_TRI_514" id="FNanchor_25_TRI_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_TRI_514" class="fnanchor">[25 tri]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>Accurate experiments, and more especially the <i>researches of
Stas</i> at Brussels, show the proportion in which silver reacts with
metallic chlorides.  These researches have led to the determination
of the <i>combining weights</i> of silver, sodium, potassium, chlorine,
bromine, iodine, and other elements, and are distinguished for their
model exactitude, and we will therefore describe them in some detail.
As sodium chloride is the chloride most generally used for the precipitation
of silver, since it can most easily be obtained in a pure state,
we will here cite the quantitative observations made by Stas for showing
the co-relation between the quantities of chloride of sodium and
silver which react together. In order to obtain perfectly pure sodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
chloride, he took pure rock salt, containing only a small quantity of
magnesium and calcium compounds and a small amount of potassium
salts. This salt was dissolved in water, and the saturated solution
evaporated by boiling. The sodium chloride separated out during the
boiling, and the mother liquor containing the impurities was poured
off. Alcohol of 65 p.c. strength and platinic chloride were added
to the resultant salt, in order to precipitate all the potassium and
a certain part of the sodium salts. The resultant alcoholic solution,
containing the sodium and platinum chlorides, was then mixed with a
solution of pure ammonium chloride in order to remove the platinic
chloride. After this precipitation, the solution was evaporated in a
platinum retort, and then separate portions of this purified sodium
chloride were collected as they crystallised. The same salt was prepared
from sodium sulphate, tartrate, nitrate, and from the platinochloride,
in order to have sodium chloride prepared by different methods
and from different sources, and in this manner ten samples of sodium
chloride thus prepared were purified and investigated in their relation
to silver. After being dried, weighed quantities of all ten samples
of sodium chloride were dissolved in water and mixed with a solution
in nitric acid of a weighed quantity of perfectly pure silver. A
slightly greater quantity of silver was taken than would be required
for the decomposition of the sodium chloride, and when, after pouring
in all the silver solution, the silver chloride had settled, the
amount of silver remaining in excess was determined by means of a
solution of sodium chloride of known strength. This solution of
sodium chloride was added so long as it formed a precipitate. In this
manner Stas determined how many parts of sodium chloride correspond
to 100 parts by weight of silver. The result of ten determinations
was that for the entire precipitation of 100 parts of silver,
from 54·2060 to 54·2093 parts of sodium chloride were required. The
difference is so inconsiderable that it has no perceptible influence
on the subsequent calculations. The mean of ten experiments was
that 100 parts of silver react with 54·2078 parts of sodium chloride.
In order to learn from this the relation between the chlorine and
silver, it was necessary to determine the quantity of chlorine contained in
54·2078 parts of sodium chloride, or, what is the same thing, the quantity
of chlorine which combines with 100 parts of silver. For this purpose
Stas made a series of observations on the quantity of silver chloride
obtained from 100 parts of silver. Four syntheses were made by him
for this purpose. The first synthesis consisted in the formation of
silver chloride by the action of chlorine on silver at a red heat. This
experiment showed that 100 parts of silver give 132·841, 132·843 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
132·843 of silver chloride. The second method consisted in dissolving
a given quantity of silver in nitric acid and precipitating it by means
of gaseous hydrochloric acid passed over the surface of the liquid; the
resultant mass was evaporated in the dark to drive off the nitric acid
and excess of hydrochloric acid, and the remaining silver chloride was
fused first in an atmosphere of hydrochloric acid gas and then in air.
In this process the silver chloride was not washed, and therefore there
could be no loss from solution. Two experiments made by this
method showed that 100 parts of silver give 132·849 and 132·846
parts of silver chloride. A third series of determinations was also
made by precipitating a solution of silver nitrate with a certain
excess of gaseous hydrochloric acid. The amount of silver chloride
obtained was altogether 132·848. Lastly, a fourth determination was
made by precipitating dissolved silver with a solution of ammonium
chloride, when it was found that a considerable amount of silver
(0·3175) had passed into solution in the washing; for 100 parts
of silver there was obtained altogether 132·8417 of silver chloride.
Thus from the mean of seven determinations it appears that 100
parts of silver give 132·8445 parts of silver chloride&mdash;that is, that
32·8445 parts of chlorine are able to combine with 100 parts of
silver and with that quantity of sodium which is contained in
54·2078 parts of sodium chloride. These observations show that
32·8445 parts of chlorine combine with 100 parts of silver and
with 21·3633 parts of sodium. From these figures expressing the
relation between the combining weights of chlorine, silver, and sodium,
it would be possible to determine their atomic weights&mdash;that is, the
combining quantity of these elements with respect to one part by
weight of hydrogen or 16 parts of oxygen, if there existed a series of
similarly accurate determinations for the reactions between hydrogen
or oxygen and one of these elements&mdash;chlorine, sodium, or silver. If
we determine the quantity of silver chloride which is obtained from
silver chlorate, AgClO<sub>3</sub>, we shall know the relation between the
combining weights of silver chloride and oxygen, so that, taking the
quantity of oxygen as a constant magnitude, we can learn from this
reaction the combining weight of silver chloride, and from the preceding
numbers the combining weights of chlorine and silver. For this
purpose it was first necessary to obtain pure silver chlorate. This
Stas did by acting on silver oxide or carbonate, suspended in water,
with gaseous chlorine.<a name="FNanchor_26_515" id="FNanchor_26_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_515" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>The decomposition of the silver chlorate thus obtained was accomplished
by the action of a solution of sulphurous anhydride on
it. The salt was first fused by carefully heating it at 243°. The solution
of sulphurous anhydride used was one saturated at 0°. Sulphurous
anhydride in dilute solutions is oxidised at the expense of silver
chlorate, even at low temperatures, with great ease if the liquid be
continually shaken, sulphuric acid and silver chloride being formed:
AgClO<sub>3</sub> + 3SO<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = AgCl + 3H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. After decomposition, the
resultant liquid was evaporated, and the residue of silver chloride
weighed. Thus the process consisted in taking a known weight of
silver chlorate, converting it into silver chloride, and determining
the weight of the latter. The analysis conducted in this manner gave
the following results, which, like the preceding, designate the weight
in a vacuum calculated from the weights obtained in air: In the
first experiment it appeared that 138·7890 grams of silver chlorate
gave 103·9795 parts of silver chloride, and in the second experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
that 259·5287 grains of chlorate gave 194·44515 grams of silver
chloride, and after fusion 194·4435 grams. The mean result of both
experiments, converted into percentages, shows that 100 parts of silver
chlorate contain 74·9205 of silver chloride and 25·0795 parts of oxygen.
From this it is possible to calculate the combining weight of silver
chloride, because in the decomposition of silver chlorate there are
obtained three atoms of oxygen and one molecule of silver
chloride: AgClO<sub>3</sub> = AgCl + 3O. Taking the weight of an atom
of oxygen to be 16, we find from the mean result that the equivalent
weight of silver chloride is equal to 143·395. Thus if O = 16,
AgCl = 143·395, and as the preceding experiments show that silver
chloride contains 32·8445 parts of chlorine per 100 parts of silver,
the weight of the atom of silver<a name="FNanchor_26_BIS_516" id="FNanchor_26_BIS_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_BIS_516" class="fnanchor">[26 bis]</a> must be 107·94 and that
of chlorine 35·45. The weight of the atom of sodium is determined
from the fact that 21·3633 parts of sodium chloride combine with
32·8445 parts of chlorine; consequently Na = 23·05. This conclusion,
arrived at by the analysis of silver chlorate, was verified by means
of the analysis of potassium chlorate by decomposing it by heat
and determining the weight of the potassium chloride formed, and also
by effecting the same decomposition by igniting the chlorate in a
stream of hydrochloric acid. The combining weight of potassium
chloride was thus determined, and another series of determinations
confirmed the relation between chlorine, potassium, and silver, in the
same manner as the relation between sodium, chlorine, and silver was
determined above. Consequently, the combining weights of sodium,
chlorine, and potassium could be deduced by combining these data with
the analysis of silver chlorate and the synthesis of silver chloride. The
agreement between the results showed that the determinations made
by the last method were perfectly correct, and did not depend in any
considerable degree on the methods which were employed in the preceding
determinations, as the combining weights of chlorine and silver
obtained were the same as before. There was naturally a difference,
but so small a one that it undoubtedly depended on the errors incidental
to every process of weighing and experiment. The atomic weight
of silver was also determined by Stas by means of the synthesis of
silver sulphide and the analysis of silver sulphate. The combining
weight obtained by this method was 107·920. The synthesis of silver
iodide and the analysis of silver iodate gave the figure 107·928. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
synthesis of silver bromide with the analysis of silver bromate gave the
figure 107·921. The synthesis of silver chloride and the analysis of
silver chlorate gave a mean result of 107·937. Hence there is no
doubt that the combining weight of silver is at least as much as 107·9&mdash;greater
than 107·90 and less than 107·95, and probably equal to the
mean = 107·92. Stas determined the combining weights of many other
elements in this manner, such as lithium, potassium, sodium, bromine,
chlorine, iodine, and also nitrogen, for the determination of the
amount of silver nitrate obtained from a given amount of silver
gives directly the combining weight of nitrogen. Taking that
of oxygen as 16, he obtained the following combining weights
for these elements: nitrogen 14·04, silver 107·93, chlorine 35·46,
bromine 79·95, iodine 126·85, lithium 7·02, sodium 23·04, potassium
39·15. These figures differ slightly from those which are usually
employed in chemical investigations. They must be regarded as the
result of the best observations, whilst the figures usually used in
practical chemistry are only approximate&mdash;are, so to speak, round
numbers for the atomic weights which differ so little from the exact
figures (for instance, for Ag 108 instead of 107·92, for Na 23 instead
of 23·04) that in ordinary determinations and calculations the
difference falls within the limits of experimental error inseparable from
such determinations.</p>

<p>The exhaustive investigations conducted by Stas on the atomic
weights of the above-named elements have great significance in
the solution of the problem as to whether the atomic weights of the
elements can be expressed in whole numbers if the unit taken be the
atomic weight of hydrogen. Prout, at the beginning of this century,
stated that this was the case, and held that the atomic weights of the
elements are multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. The subsequent
determinations of Berzelius, Penny, Marchand, Marignac, Dumas,
and more especially of Stas, proved this conclusion to be untenable;
since a whole series of elements proved to have fractional atomic
weights&mdash;for example, chlorine, about 35·5. On account of this,
Marignac and Dumas stated that the atomic weights of the elements
are expressed in relation to hydrogen, either by whole numbers
or by numbers with simple fractions of the magnitudes &frac12; and &frac14;. But
Stas's researches refute this supposition also. Even between the combining
weight of hydrogen and oxygen, there is not, so far as is yet
known, that simple relation which is required by <i>Prout's hypothesis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_27_517" id="FNanchor_27_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_517" class="fnanchor">[27]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
<i>i.e.</i>, taking O = 16, the atomic weight of hydrogen is equal not to 1 but
to a greater number somewhere between 1·002 and 1·008 or mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
1·005. Such a conclusion arrived at by direct experiment cannot but
be regarded as having greater weight than Prout's supposition
(hypothesis) that the atomic weights of the elements are in multiple
proportion to each other, which would give reason for surmising (but not
asserting) a complexity of nature in the elements, and their common
origin from a single primary material, and for expecting their
mutual conversion into each other. All such ideas and hopes must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
now, thanks more especially to Stas, be placed in a region void of any
experimental support whatever, and therefore not subject to the discipline
of the positive data of science.</p>

<p>Among the platinum metals ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium,
by their atomic weights and properties, approach silver, just as iron
and its analogues (cobalt and nickel) approach copper in all respects.
<i>Gold</i> stands in exactly the same position in relation to the heavy
platinum metals, osmium, iridium, and platinum, as copper and
silver do to the two preceding series. The atomic weight of gold is
nearly equal to their atomic weights;<a name="FNanchor_28_518" id="FNanchor_28_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_518" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> it is dense like these metals.
It also gives various grades of oxidation, which are feeble, both in
a basic and an acid sense. Whilst near to osmium, iridium, and platinum,
gold at the same time is able, like copper and silver, to form
compounds which answer to the type RX&mdash;that is, oxides of the composition
R<sub>2</sub>O. Cuprous chloride, CuCl, silver chloride, AgCl, and aurous
chloride, AuCl, are substances which are very much alike in their
physical and chemical properties.<a name="FNanchor_28_BIS_519" id="FNanchor_28_BIS_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_BIS_519" class="fnanchor">[28 bis]</a> They are insoluble in water,
but dissolve in hydrochloric acid and ammonia, in potassium cyanide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
sodium thiosulphate, &amp;c. Just as copper forms a link between the iron
metals and zinc, and as silver unites the light platinum metals with
cadmium, so also gold presents a transition from the heavy platinum
metals to mercury. Copper gives saline compounds of the types CuX
and CuX<sub>2</sub>, silver of the type AgX, whilst gold, besides compounds of
the type AuX, very easily and most frequently forms those of the type
AuCl<sub>3</sub>. The compounds of this type frequently pass into those of the
lower type, just as PtX<sub>4</sub> passes into PtX<sub>2</sub>, and the same is observable
in the elements which, in their atomic weights, follow gold. Mercury
gives HgX<sub>2</sub> and HgX, thallium gives TlX<sub>3</sub> and TlX, lead gives
PbX<sub>4</sub> and PbX<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, gold in a qualitative respect
differs from silver and copper in the <i>extreme ease</i> with which all its compounds
are <i>reduced to metal</i> by many means. This is not only accomplished
by many reducing agents, but also by the action of heat. Thus
its chlorides and oxides lose their chlorine and oxygen when heated,
and, if the temperature be sufficiently high, these elements are entirely
expelled and metallic gold alone remains. Its compounds, therefore,
act as oxidising agents.<a name="FNanchor_29_520" id="FNanchor_29_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_520" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><i>In nature</i> gold occurs in the primary and chiefly in quartzose rocks,
and especially in quartz veins, as in the Urals (at Berezoffsk), in
Australia, and in California. The native gold is extracted from these
rocks by subjecting them to a mechanical treatment consisting of
crushing and washing.<a name="FNanchor_29_BIS_521" id="FNanchor_29_BIS_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_BIS_521" class="fnanchor">[29 bis]</a> Nature has already accomplished a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
disintegration of the hard rocky matter containing gold.<a name="FNanchor_30_522" id="FNanchor_30_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_522" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> These disintegrated
rocks, washed by rain and other water, have formed gold-bearing
deposits, which are known as <i>alluvial gold deposits</i>. Gold-bearing
soil is sometimes met with on the surface and sometimes under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
the upper soil, but more frequently along the banks of dried-up water-courses
and running streams. The sand of many rivers contains,
however, a very small amount of gold, which it is not profitable to
work; for example, that of the Alpine rivers contains 5 parts of gold
in 10,000,000 parts of sand. The richest gold deposits are those of
Siberia, especially in the southern parts of the Government of Yeniseisk,
the South Urals, Mexico, California, South Africa, and Australia,
and then the comparatively poorer alluvial deposits of many countries
(Hungary, the Alps, and Spain in Europe). The extraction of the
gold from alluvial deposits is based on the principle of levigation; the
earth is washed, while constantly agitated, by a stream of water,
which carries away the lighter portion of the earth, and leaves the
coarser particles of the rock and heavier particles of the gold, together
with certain substances which accompany it, in the washing apparatus.
The extraction of this <i>washed</i> gold only necessitates mechanical appliances,<a name="FNanchor_31_523" id="FNanchor_31_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_523" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
and it is not therefore surprising that gold was known to
savages and in the most remote period of history. It sometimes occurs
in crystals belonging to the regular system, but in the majority of cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
in nuggets or grains of greater or less magnitude. It always contains
silver (from very small quantities up to 30 p.c., when it is called
&lsquo;electrum&rsquo;) and certain other metals, among which lead and rhodium
are sometimes found.</p>

<p><i>The separation of the silver</i> from gold is generally carried on with
great precision, as the presence of the silver in the gold does not
increase its value for exchange, and it can be substituted by other
less valuable metals, so that the extraction of the silver, as a precious
metal, from its alloy with gold, is a profitable operation. This
separation is conducted by different methods. Sometimes the argentiferous
gold is melted in crucibles, together with a mixture of common
salt and powdered bricks. The greater portion of the silver is thus
converted into the chloride, which fuses and is absorbed by the slags,
from which it may be extracted by the usual methods. The silver is
also extracted from gold by treating it with boiling sulphuric acid,
which does not act on the gold but dissolves the silver. But if the
alloy does not contain a large proportion of silver it cannot be extracted
by this method or at all events the separation will be imperfect, and
therefore a fresh amount of silver is added (by fusion) to the gold, in
such quantity that the alloy contains twice as much silver as gold.
The silver which is added is preferably such as contains gold, which is
very frequently the case. The alloy thus formed is poured in a thin
stream into water, by which means it is obtained in a granulated
form; it is then boiled with strong sulphuric acid, three parts of
acid being used to one part of alloy. The sulphuric acid extracts
all the silver without acting on the gold. It is best, however, to
pour off the first portion of the acid, which has dissolved the silver,
and then treat the residue of still imperfectly pure gold with a fresh
quantity of sulphuric acid. The gold is thus obtained in the form
of powder, which is washed with water until it is quite free from
silver. The silver is precipitated from the solution by means of
copper, so that cupric sulphate and metallic silver are obtained. This
process is carried out in many countries, as in Russia, at the Government
mints.</p>

<p>Gold is generally used alloyed with copper; since pure gold,
like pure silver, is very soft, and therefore soon worn away. In
assaying or determining the amount of pure gold in such an alloy
it is usual to add silver to the gold in order to make up an alloy
containing three parts of silver to one of gold (this is known as
quartation because the alloy contains &frac14; of gold), and the resultant
alloy is treated with nitric acid. If the silver be not in excess over
the gold, it is not all dissolved by the nitric acid, and this is the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
for the quartation. The amount of pure gold (assay) is determined by
weighing the gold which remains after this treatment. English gold
(= 22 carats) coinage is composed of an alloy containing 91·66 p.c. of
gold, but for many articles gold is frequently used containing a larger
amount of foreign metals.</p>

<p><i>Pure gold</i> may be obtained from gold alloys by dissolving in aqua
regia, and then adding ferrous sulphate to the solution or heating it
with a solution of oxalic acid. These deoxidising agents reduce the
gold, but not the other metals. The chlorine combined with the gold
then acts like free chlorine. The gold, thus reduced, is precipitated as
an exceedingly fine brown powder.<a name="FNanchor_31_BIS_524" id="FNanchor_31_BIS_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_BIS_524" class="fnanchor">[31 bis]</a> It is then washed with water,
and fused with nitre or borax. Pure gold reflects a yellow light, and
in the form of very thin sheets (gold leaf), into which it can be
hammered and rolled,<a name="FNanchor_31_TRI_525" id="FNanchor_31_TRI_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_TRI_525" class="fnanchor">[31 tri]</a> it transmits a bluish-green light. The
specific gravity of gold is about 19·5, the sp. gr. of gold coin is about
17·1. It fuses at 1090°&mdash;at a higher temperature than silver&mdash;and can
be drawn into exceedingly fine wires or hammered into thin sheets.
With its softness and ductility, gold is distinguished for its tenacity,
and a gold wire two millimetres thick breaks only under a load of 68
kilograms. Gold vaporises even at a furnace heat, and imparts a
greenish colour to a flame passing over it in a furnace. Gold alloys
with copper almost without changing its volume.<a name="FNanchor_32_526" id="FNanchor_32_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_526" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In its chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
aspect, gold presents, as is already seen from its general characteristics
given above, an example of the so-called noble metals&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it is
incapable of being oxidised at any temperature, and its oxide is
decomposed when calcined. Only chlorine and bromine combine
directly with it at the ordinary temperature, but many other metals
and non-metals combine with it at a red heat&mdash;for example, sulphur,
phosphorus, and arsenic. Mercury dissolves it with great ease. It
dissolves in potassium cyanide in the presence of air; a mixture of
sulphuric acid with nitric acid dissolves it with the aid of heat,
although in small quantity. It is also soluble in aqua regia and in
selenic acid. Sulphuric, hydrochloric, nitric, and hydrofluoric acids
and the caustic alkalis do not act on gold, but a mixture of hydrochloric
acid with such oxidising agents as evolve chlorine naturally
dissolves it like aqua regia.<a name="FNanchor_32_BIS_527" id="FNanchor_32_BIS_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_BIS_527" class="fnanchor">[32 bis]</a></p>

<p>As regards the compounds of gold, they belong, as was said
above, to the types AuX<sub>3</sub> and AuX. <i>Auric chloride</i> or <i>gold trichloride</i>,
AuCl<sub>3</sub>, which is formed when gold is dissolved in aqua regia,
belongs to the former and higher of these types. The solution of this
substance in water has a yellow colour, and it may be obtained pure by
evaporating the solution in aqua regia to dryness, but not to the point
of decomposition. If the evaporation proceed to the point of crystallisation,
a compound of gold chloride and hydrochloric acid, AuHCl<sub>4</sub>, is
obtained, like the allied compounds of platinum; but it easily parts
with the acid and leaves auric chloride, which fuses into a red-brown
liquid, and then solidifies to a crystalline mass. If dry chlorine be
passed over gold in powder it forms a mixture of aurous and auric
chlorides, but the aurous chloride is also decomposed by water into
gold and auric chloride. Auric chloride crystallises from its solutions
as AuCl<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, which easily loses water, and the dry chloride loses
two-thirds of its chlorine at 185°, forming aurous chloride, whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
above 300° the latter chloride also loses its chlorine and leaves
metallic gold. Auric chloride is the usual form in which gold occurs in
solutions, and in which its salts are used in the arts and for chemical
purposes. It is soluble in water, alcohol, and ether. Light has a reducing
action on these solutions, and after a time metallic gold is deposited
upon the sides of vessels containing the solution. Hydrogen when
nascent, and even in a gaseous form, reduces gold from this solution
to a metallic state. The reduction is more conveniently and usually
effected by ferrous sulphate, and in general by the action of ferrous
salts.<a name="FNanchor_33_528" id="FNanchor_33_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_528" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>If a solution of potassium hydroxide be added to a solution of auric
chloride, a precipitate is first formed, which re-dissolves in an excess of
the alkali. On being evaporated under the receiver of an air-pump,
this solution yields yellow crystals, which present the same composition
as the double salts AuMCl<sub>4</sub>, with the substitution of the chlorine by
oxygen&mdash;that is to say, <i>potassium aurate</i>, AuKO<sub>2</sub>, is formed in crystals
containing 3H<sub>2</sub>O. The solution has a distinctly alkaline reaction.
<i>Auric oxide</i>, Au<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, separates when this alkaline solution is boiled with
an excess of sulphuric acid. But it then still retains some alkali; however,
it may be obtained in a pure state as a brown powder by
dissolving in nitric acid and diluting with water. The brown powder
decomposes below 250° into gold and oxygen. It is insoluble in water
and in many acids, but it dissolves in alkalis, which shows the acid
character of this oxide. An hydroxide, Au(OH)<sub>3</sub> may be obtained as a
brown powder by adding magnesium oxide to a solution of auric chloride
and treating the resultant precipitate of magnesium aurate with
nitric acid. This hydroxide loses water at 100°, and gives auric oxide.<a name="FNanchor_34_529" id="FNanchor_34_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_529" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>The starting-point of the compounds of the type AuX<a name="FNanchor_35_530" id="FNanchor_35_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_530" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> is <i>gold
monochloride</i> or <i>aurous chloride</i>, AuCl, which is formed, as mentioned
above, by heating auric chloride at 185°. Aurous chloride forms a
yellowish-white powder; this, when heated with water, is decomposed
into metallic gold and auric chloride, which passes into solution:
3AuCl = AuCl<sub>3</sub> + 2Au. This decomposition is accelerated by the action
of light. Hence it is obvious that the compounds corresponding with
aurous oxide are comparatively unstable. But this only refers to the
simple compounds AuX; some of the complex compounds, on the
contrary, form the most stable compounds of gold. Such, for example,
is the cyanide of gold and potassium, AuK(CN)<sub>2</sub>. It is formed,
for instance, when finely-divided gold dissolves in the presence of
air in a solution of potassium cyanide: 4KCN + 2Au + H<sub>2</sub>O + O
= 2KAu(CN)<sub>2</sub> + 2KHO (this reaction also proceeds with solid pieces
of gold, although very slowly). The same compound is formed in
solution when many compounds of gold are mixed with potassium
cyanide, because if a higher compound of gold be taken, it is reduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
by the potassium cyanide into aurous oxide, which dissolves in potassium
cyanide and forms KAu(CN)<sub>2</sub>. This substance is soluble in
water, and gives a colourless solution, which can be kept for a long
time, and is employed in electro-gilding&mdash;that is, for coating other
metallic objects with a layer of gold, which is deposited if the object
be connected with the negative pole of a battery and the positive pole
consist of a gold plate. When an electric current is passed between
them, the gold from the latter will dissolve, whilst a coating of gold
from the solution will be deposited on the object.</p>

Chapter XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_2_BIS_404">2 bis</a>), and on burning the iron pyrites for sulphurous anhydride the
copper oxide remains in the residue, from which the copper is often extracted with profit.
For this purpose the whole of the sulphur is not burnt off from the iron pyrites, but a
portion is left behind in the ore, which is then slowly ignited (roasted) with access of air.
Cupric sulphate is then formed, and is extracted by water; or what is better and more
frequently done, the residue from the roasting of the pyrites is roasted with common
salt, and the solution of cupric chloride obtained by lixiviating is precipitated with iron.
A far greater amount of copper is obtained from other sulphuretted ores. Among these
<i>copper glance</i>, Cu<sub>2</sub>S, is more rarely met with. It has a metallic lustre, is grey, generally
crystalline, and is obtained in admixture with organic matter; so that there is no doubt
that its origin is due to the reducing action of the latter on solutions of cupric sulphate.
<i>Variegated copper ore</i>, which crystallises in octahedra, not infrequently forms an
admixture in copper glance; it has a metallic lustre, and is reddish-brown; it has a
superficial play of colours, due to oxidation proceeding on its surface. Its composition is
Cu<sub>3</sub>FeS<sub>3</sub>. But the most common and widely-distributed copper ore is <i>copper pyrites</i>,
which crystallises in regular octahedra; it has a metallic lustre, a sp. gr. of 4·0, and
yellow colour. Its composition is CuFeS<sub>2</sub>. It must be remarked that the sulphurous
ores of copper are oxidised in the presence of water containing oxygen in solution,
and form cupric sulphate, blue vitriol, which is easily soluble in water. If this water
contains calcium carbonate, gypsum and cupric carbonate are formed by double
decomposition: CuSO<sub>4</sub> + CaCO<sub>3</sub> = CuCO<sub>3</sub> + CaSO<sub>4</sub>. Hence copper sulphide in the form
of different ores must be considered as the primary product, and the many other copper
ores as secondary products, formed by water. This is confirmed by the fact that at the
present time the water extracted from many copper mines contains cupric sulphate in
solution. From this liquid it is easy to extract cupric oxide by the action of organic
matter and various impurities of water. Hence metallic copper is sometimes found in
natural products of the modification of copper sulphide and is probably deposited by
the action of organic matter present in the water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_475" id="Footnote_4_475"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_475"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Copper ores rich in oxygen are very rare; the sulphur ores are of more common
occurrence, but the extraction of the copper from them is much more difficult. The
problem here not only consists in the removal of the sulphur, but also in the removal of
the iron combined with the sulphur and copper. This is attained by a whole series of
operations, after which there still sometimes remains the extraction of the metallic silver
which generally accompanies the copper, although in but small quantity. These
processes commence with the roasting&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> calcination&mdash;of the ore with access of air, by
which means the sulphur is converted into sulphurous anhydride. It should here be
remarked that iron sulphide is more easily oxidised than copper sulphide, and therefore
the greater part of the iron in the residue from roasting is no longer in the form of
sulphide but of oxide of iron. The roasted ore is mixed with charcoal, and siliceous fluxes,
and smelted in a cupola furnace. The iron then passes into the slag, because its oxide
gives an easily-fusible mass with the silica, whilst the copper, in the form of sulphide,
fuses and collects under the slag. The greater part of the iron is removed from the
mass by this smelting. The resultant <i>coarse metal</i> is again roasted in order to
remove the greater part of the sulphur from the copper sulphide, and to convert the
metal into oxide, after which the mass is again smelted. These processes are repeated
several times, according to the richness of the ore. During these smeltings a portion of
the copper is already obtained in a metallic form, because copper sulphide gives
metallic copper with the oxide (CuS + 2CuO = 3Cu + SO<sub>2</sub>). We will not here describe
the furnaces used or the details of this process, but the above remarks include the explanation
of those chemical processes which are accomplished in the various technical
operations which are made use of in the process (for details <i>see</i> works on
metallurgy).</p>

<p>Besides the smelting of copper there also exist methods for its extraction from
solutions in the wet way, as it is called. Recourse is generally had to these methods for
poor copper ores. The copper is brought into solution, from which it is separated by
means of metallic iron or by other methods (by the action of an electric current). The
sulphides are roasted in such a manner that the greater part of the copper is oxidised
into cupric sulphate, whilst at the same time the corresponding iron salts are as far as
possible decomposed. This process is based on the fact that the copper sulphides absorb
oxygen when they are calcined in the presence of air, forming cupric sulphate. The
roasted ore is treated with water, to which acid is sometimes added, and after lixiviation
the resultant solution containing copper is treated either with metallic iron or with
milk of lime, which precipitates cupric hydroxide from the solution. Copper oxide
ores poor in metal may be treated with dilute acids in order to obtain the copper
oxides in solution, from which the copper is then easily precipitated either by iron or
as hydroxide by lime. According to Hunt and Douglas's method, the copper in the ore
is converted by calcination into the cupric oxide, which is brought into solution by
the action of a mixture of solutions of ferrous sulphate and sodium chloride;
the oxide converts the ferrous chloride into ferric oxide, forming copper chlorides,
according to the equation 3CuO + 2FeCl<sub>2</sub> = CuCl<sub>2</sub> + 2CuCl + Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The cupric chloride
is soluble in water, whilst the cuprous chloride is dissolved in the solution of sodium
chloride, and therefore all the copper passes into solution, from which it is precipitated
by iron.</p>

<p>The same American metallurgists give the following wet method for extracting the
Ag and Au occurring in many copper ores, especially in sulphurous ores: (1) The Cu<sub>2</sub>S is
first converted into oxide by roasting in a calciner; (2) the CuO is extracted by the
dilute sulphuric acid obtained in the fourth process, the Cu then passes into solution,
while the Ag, Au and oxides of iron remain behind in the residue (from which the noble
metals may be extracted); (3) a portion of the copper in solution is converted into CuCl<sub>2</sub>
(and CaSO<sub>4</sub> precipitated) by means of the CaCl<sub>2</sub> obtained in the fifth process; (4) the
mixture of solutions of CuSO<sub>4</sub> and CuCl<sub>2</sub> is converted into the insoluble CuCl (salt of the
suboxide) by the action of the SO<sub>2</sub> obtained by roasting the ore (in the first operation),
sulphuric acid is then formed in the solution, according to the equation: CuSO<sub>4</sub> + CuCl<sub>2</sub>
+ SO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2CuCl; (5) the precipitated CuCl is treated with lime and
water, and gives CuCl<sub>2</sub> in solution and CuO in the residue; and lastly (6) the Cu<sub>2</sub>O is
reduced to metallic Cu by carbon in a furnace. According to Crooke's method the impure
copper regulus obtained by roasting and smelting the ore is broken up and immersed
repeatedly in molten lead, which extracts the Ag and Au occurring in the regulus. The
regulus is then heated in a reverberatory furnace to run off the lead, and is then smelted
for Cu.</p>

<p>The copper brought into the market often contains small quantities of various impurities.
Among these there are generally present iron, lead, silver, arsenic, and sometimes
small quantities of oxides of copper. As copper, when mixed with a small amount of
foreign substances, loses its tenacity to a certain degree, the manufacture of very thin
sheet copper requires the use of Chili copper, which is distinguished for its great softness,
and therefore when it is desired to have pure copper, it is best to take thin sheet copper,
like that which is used in the manufacture of cartridges. But the purest copper is electrolytic
copper&mdash;that is, that which is deposited from a solution by the action of an
electric current.</p>


<p>If the copper contains silver, as is often the case, it is used in gold refineries for the
precipitation of silver from its solutions in sulphuric acid. Iron and zinc reduce copper
salts, but copper reduces mercury and silver salts. The precipitate contains not only the
silver which was previously in solution, but also all that which was in the copper. The
silver solutions in sulphuric acid are obtained in the separation of silver from gold by
treating their alloys with sulphuric acid, which only dissolves the silver.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_476" id="Footnote_5_476"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_476"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Schützenberger showed that when the basic carbonate of copper is decomposed by
an electric current it gives, besides the ordinary copper, an allotropic form which grows
on the negative platinum electrode, if its surface be smaller than that of the positive
copper electrode, in the form of brittle crystalline growths of sp. gr. 8·1. It differs from
ordinary copper by giving not nitric oxide but nitrous oxide when treated with nitric
acid, and in being very easily oxidised in air, and coated with red shades of colour. It
is possible that this is copper hydride, or copper which has occluded hydrogen. Spring
(1892) observed that copper reduced from the oxide by hydrogen at the lowest possible
temperature was pulverulent, while that reduced from CuCl<sub>2</sub> at a somewhat high temperature
appeared in bright crystals. The same difference occurs with many other
metals, and is probably partly due to the volatility of the metallic chlorides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_477" id="Footnote_6_477"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_477"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> This is taken advantage of in practice; for instance, by pouring dilute acids over
copper turnings on revolving tables in the preparation of copper salts, such as verdigris,
or the basic acetate 2C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>,CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, which is so much used as an oil paint (<i>i.e.</i>
with boiled oil). The capacity of copper for absorbing oxygen in the presence of acids
is so great that it is possible by this means (by taking, for example, thin copper shavings
moistened with sulphuric acid) to take up all the oxygen from a given volume of air, and
this is even employed for the analysis of air.</p>

<p>The combination of copper with oxygen is not only aided by acids but also by alkalis,
although cupric oxide does not appear to have an acid character. Alkalis do not act on
copper except in the presence of air, when they produce cupric oxide, which does not
appear to combine with such alkalis as caustic potash or soda. But the <i>action of
ammonia</i> is particularly distinct (Chapter V., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_2_275">2</a>). In the action of a solution of
ammonia not only is oxygen absorbed by the copper, but it also acts on the ammonia,
and a definite quantity of ammonia is always acted on simultaneously with the passage
of the copper into solution. The ammonia is then converted into nitrous acid, according
to the reaction: NH<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> = NHO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O, and the nitrous acid thus formed passes into the
state of ammonium nitrite, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>. In this manner three equivalents of oxygen are
expended on the oxidation of the ammonia, and six equivalents of oxygen pass over to
the copper, forming six atoms of cupric oxide. The latter does not remain in the state
of oxide, but combines with the ammonia.</p>

<p>A strong solution of common salt does not act on copper, but a dilute solution of the
salt corrodes copper, converting it into oxychloride&mdash;that is, in the presence of air.
This action of salt water is evident in those cases where the bottoms of ships are coated
with sheet copper. From what has been said above it will be evident that copper vessels
should not be employed in the preparation of food, because this contains salts and acids
which act on copper in the presence of air, and give copper salts, which are poisonous,
and therefore the food prepared in untinned copper vessels may be poisonous. Hence
tinned vessels are employed for this purpose&mdash;that is, copper vessels coated with a thin
layer of tin, on which acid and saline solutions do not act.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_BIS_478" id="Footnote_6_BIS_478"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_BIS_478"><span class="label">[6 bis]</span></a> Copper, besides the cuprous oxide, Cu<sub>2</sub>O, and cupric oxide, CuO, gives two known
higher forms of oxidation, but they have scarcely been investigated, and even their
composition is not well known. <i>Copper dioxide</i> (CuO<sub>2</sub>, or CuO<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, perhaps CuOH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)
is obtained by the action of hydrogen peroxide on cupric hydroxide, when the green
colour of the latter is changed to yellow. It is very unstable, and is decomposed even
by boiling water, with the evolution of oxygen, whilst the action of acids gives cupric
salts, oxygen being also disengaged. A still higher <i>copper peroxide</i> is formed by heating
a mixture of caustic potash, nitre, and metallic copper to a red heat, and by dissolving
cupric hydroxide in solutions of the hypochlorites of the alkali metals. A slight heating
of the soluble salt formed is enough for it to be decomposed into oxygen and copper
dioxide, which is precipitated. Judging from Frémy's researches, the composition of the
copper-potassic compound should be K<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>. Perhaps this is a compound of the
peroxides of potassium, K<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and of copper, CuO<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_479" id="Footnote_7_479"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_479"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Colourless solutions of cuprous salts may also be obtained by the action of sulphurous
or phosphorous acid and similar lower grades of oxidation on the blue solutions of
the cupric salts. This is very clearly and easily effected by means of sodium thiosulphate,
Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which is oxidised in the process. Cuprous oxide can not only be
obtained by the deoxidation of cupric oxide, but also directly from metallic copper itself,
because the latter, in oxidising at a red heat in air, first gives cuprous oxide. It is prepared
in this manner on a large scale by heating sheet copper rolled into spirals in
reverberatory furnaces. Care must be taken that the air is not in great excess, and that
the coating of red cuprous oxide formed does not begin to pass into the black cupric oxide.
If the oxidised spiral sheet is then unbent, the brittle cuprous oxide falls away from
the soft metal. The suboxide obtained in this manner fuses with ease. It is necessary
to prevent the access of air during the fusion, and if the mass contains cupric oxide it
must be mixed with charcoal, which reduces the latter. Cuprous chloride, CuCl, corresponding
with cuprous oxide (as sodium chloride corresponds with sodium oxide), when
calcined with sodium carbonate, gives sodium chloride and cuprous oxide, carbonic
anhydride being evolved, because it does not combine with the cuprous oxide under these
conditions. The reaction can be expressed by the following equation: 2CuCl + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
= Cu<sub>2</sub>O + 2NaCl + CO<sub>2</sub>. The cupric oxide itself, when calcined with finely-divided copper,
this copper powder may be obtained by many methods&mdash;for instance, by immersing zinc
in a solution of a copper salt, or by igniting cupric oxide in hydrogen), gives the fusible
cuprous oxide: Cu + CuO = Cu<sub>2</sub>O. Both the native and artificial cuprous oxide have a
sp. gr. of 5·6. It is insoluble in water, and is not acted on by (dry) air. When heated
with acids the suboxide forms a solution of a cupric salt and metallic copper&mdash;for example,
Cu<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = Cu + CuSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. However, strong hydrochloric acid does not separate
metallic copper on dissolving cuprous oxide, which is due to the fact that the cuprous
chloride formed is soluble in strong hydrochloric acid. Cuprous oxide also dissolves in
a solution of ammonia, and in the absence of air gives a colourless solution, which turns
blue in the air, absorbing oxygen, owing to the conversion of the cuprous oxide into
cupric oxide. The blue solution thus formed may be again reconverted into a colourless
cuprous solution by immersing a copper strip in it, because the metallic copper then
deoxidises the cupric oxide in the solution into cuprous oxide. Cuprous oxide is characterised
by the fact that it gives red glasses when fused with glass or with salts forming
vitreous alloys. Glass tinted with cuprous oxide is used for ornaments. The access of
air must be avoided during its preparation, because the colour then becomes green, owing
to the formation of cupric oxide, which colours glass blue. This may even be taken
advantage of in testing for copper under the blow-pipe by heating the copper compound
with borax in the flame of a blow-pipe; a red glass is obtained in the reducing flame,
and a blue glass in the oxidising flame, owing to the conversion of the cuprous into cupric
oxide.</p>

<p>Étard (1882), by passing sulphurous anhydride into a solution of cupric acetate, obtained
a white precipitate of cuprous sulphite, Cu<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, whilst he obtained the same
salt, of a red colour, from the double salt of sodium and copper; but there are not any
convincing proofs of isomerism in this case.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_480" id="Footnote_8_480"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_480"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The solubility of cuprous chloride in ammonia is due to the formation of compounds
between the ammonia and the chloride. In a warm solution the compound NH<sub>3</sub>,2CuCl
is formed, and at the ordinary temperature CuCl,NH<sub>3</sub>. This salt is soluble in hydrochloric
acid, and then forms a corresponding double salt of cuprous chloride and ammonium
chloride. By the action of a certain excess of ammonia on a hydrochloric acid
solution of cuprous chloride, very well formed crystals, having the composition
CuCl,NH<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, are obtained. Cuprous chloride is not only soluble in ammonia and
hydrochloric acid, but it also dissolves in solutions of certain other salts&mdash;for example,
in sodium chloride, potassium chloride, sodium thiosulphate, and certain others. All
the solutions of cuprous chloride act in many cases as very powerful deoxidising
substances; for example, it is easy, by means of these solutions, to precipitate
gold from its solutions in a metallic form, according to the equation AuCl<sub>3</sub> + 3CuCl
= Au + 3CuCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Among the other compounds corresponding with cuprous oxide, <i>cuprous iodide</i>, CuI,
is worthy of remark. It is a colourless substance which is insoluble in water and
sparingly soluble in ammonia (like silver iodide), but capable of absorbing it, and in this
respect it resembles cuprous chloride. It is remarkable from the fact that it is exceedingly
easily formed from the corresponding cupric compound CuI<sub>2</sub>. A solution of cupric
iodide easily decomposes into iodine and cuprous iodide, even at the ordinary temperature,
whilst cupric chloride only suffers a similar change on ignition. If a solution of a
cupric salt be mixed with a solution of potassium iodide the cupric iodide formed immediately
decomposes into free iodine and cuprous iodide, which separates out as a precipitate.
In this case the cupric salt acts in an oxidising manner, like, for example, nitrous
acid, ozone, and other substances which liberate iodine from iodides, but with this difference,
that it only liberates half, whilst they set free the whole of the iodine from potassium
iodide: 2KI + CuCl<sub>2</sub> = 2KCl + CuI + I.</p>

<p>It must also be remarked that cuprous oxide, when treated with hydrofluoric acid,
gives an insoluble cuprous fluoride, CuF. Cuprous cyanide is also insoluble in water,
and is obtained by the addition of hydrocyanic acid to a solution of cupric chloride
saturated with sulphurous anhydride. This cuprous cyanide, like silver cyanide, gives
a double soluble salt with potassium cyanide. The double cyanide of copper and
potassium is tolerably stable in the air, and enters into double decompositions with
various other salts, like those double cyanides of iron with which we are already
acquainted.</p>

<p><i>Copper hydride</i>, CuH, also belongs to the number of the cuprous compounds. It
was obtained by Würtz by mixing a hot (70°) solution of cupric sulphate with a solution
of hypophosphorous acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>. The addition of the reducing hypophosphorous acid
must be stopped when a brown precipitate makes its appearance, and when gas begins
to be evolved. The brown precipitate is the hydrated cuprous hydride. When gently
heated it disengages hydrogen; it gives cuprous oxide when exposed to the air, burns
in a stream of chlorine, and liberates hydrogen with hydrochloric acid: CuH + HCl
= CuCl + H<sub>2</sub>. Zinc, silver, mercury, lead, and many other heavy metals do not form
such a compound with hydrogen, neither under these circumstances nor under the action
of hydrogen at the moment of the decomposition of salts by a galvanic current. The
greatest resemblance is seen between cuprous hydride and the hydrogen compounds of
potassium, sodium, Pd, Ca, and Ba.</p></div>

Joannis showed that it then disengages oxygen, whose maximum tension is constant
for a given temperature, providing that fusion does not take place (the CuO then
dissolves in the molten Cu<sub>2</sub>O); that this loss of oxygen is followed by the formation of
suboxide, and that on cooling, the oxygen is again absorbed, forming CuO.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_483" id="Footnote_9_483"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_483"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Cupric oxide and many of its salts are able to give definite, although unstable,
<i>compounds with ammonia</i>. This faculty already shows itself in the fact that cupric
oxide, as well as the salts of copper, dissolves in aqueous ammonia, and also in the fact
that salts of copper absorb ammonia gas. If ammonia be added to a solution of any
cupric salt, it first forms a precipitate of cupric hydroxide, which then dissolves in an
excess of ammonia. The solution thus formed, when evaporated or on the addition of
alcohol, frequently deposits crystals of salts containing both the elements of the salt of
copper taken and of ammonia. Several such compounds are generally formed. Thus
cupric chloride, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, according to Deherain, forms four compounds with ammonia&mdash;namely,
with one, two, four, and six molecules of ammonia. Thus, for example,
if ammonia gas be passed into a boiling saturated solution of cupric chloride, on
cooling, small octahedral crystals of a blue colour separate out, containing
CuCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. At 150° this substance loses half the ammonia and all the water
contained in it, leaving the compound CuCl<sub>2</sub>,NH<sub>3</sub>. Nitrate of copper forms the compound
Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>· This compound remains unchanged on evaporation. Dry
cupric sulphate absorbs ammonia gas, and gives a compound containing five molecules of
ammonia to one of sulphate (Vol. I., p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_257">257</a>, and Chapter XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_35_445">35</a>). If this compound
is dissolved in aqueous ammonia, on evaporation it deposits a crystalline substance
containing CuSO<sub>4</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. At 150° this substance loses the molecule of water and
one-fourth of its ammonia. On ignition all these compounds part with the remaining
ammonia in the form of an ammoniacal salt, so that the residue consists of cupric oxide.
Both the hydrated and anhydrous cupric oxide are soluble in aqueous ammonia.</p>

<p>The solution obtained by the action of aqueous ammonia and air on copper turnings
(Note <a href="#Footnote_6_477">6</a>) is remarkable for its faculty of <i>dissolving cellulose</i>, which is insoluble in water,
dilute acids, and alkalis. Paper soaked in such a solution acquires the property of not
rotting, of being difficultly combustible, and waterproof, &amp;c. It has therefore been
applied, especially in England, to many practical purposes&mdash;for example, to the construction
of temporary buildings, for covering roofs, &amp;c. The composition of the
substance held in solution is Cu(HO)<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>If dry ammonia gas be passed over cupric oxide heated to 265°, a portion of the oxide
of copper remains unaltered, whilst the other portion gives <i>copper nitride</i>, the oxygen of
the copper oxide combining with the hydrogen and forming water. The oxide of copper
which remains unchanged is easily removed by washing the resultant product with
aqueous ammonia. Copper nitride is very stable, and is insoluble; it has the composition
Cu<sub>3</sub>N (<i>i.e.</i> the copper is monatomic here as in Cu<sub>2</sub>O), and is an amorphous green
powder, which is decomposed when strongly ignited, and gives cuprous chloride and
ammonium chloride when treated with hydrochloric acid. Like the other nitrides, copper
nitride, Cu<sub>3</sub>N, has scarcely been investigated. Granger (1892), by heating copper in the
vapour of phosphorus, obtained hexagonal prisms of Cu<sub>5</sub>P, which passed into Cu<sub>6</sub>P
(previously obtained by Abel) when heated in nitrogen. Arsenic is easily absorbed by
copper, and its presence (like P), even in small quantities, has a great influence upon
the properties of copper&mdash;for instance, pure copper wire 1 sq. mm. in section breaks
under a load of 35 kilos, while the presence of O·22 p.c. of arsenic raises the breaking
load to 42 kilos.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_BIS_484" id="Footnote_9_BIS_484"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_BIS_484"><span class="label">[9 bis]</span></a> As a comparatively feeble base, oxide of copper easily forms both basic and
double salts. As an instance we may mention the double salts composed of the
dichloride CuCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O and potassium chloride. The double salt CuK<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O
crystallises from solutions in <i>blue</i> plates, but when heated alone or with substances
taking up water easily gives <i>brown</i> needles CuKCl<sub>3</sub> and at the same time KCl, and this
reaction is reversible at 92° as Meyerhoffer (1889) showed (<i>i.e.</i> above 92° the simpler
double salt is formed and below 92° the more complex salt). With an excess of the
copper salt, KCl gives another double salt, Cu<sub>2</sub>KCl<sub>5</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, the transition temperature of
which is 55°. The instances of equilibria which are encountered in such complex
relations (<i>see</i> Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_25_804">25</a>, astrakhanite, and Chapter XXII., Note <a href="#Footnote_23_426">23</a>) are
embraced by the <i>law of phases</i> given by Gibbs (Transactions of the Connecticut
Academy of Sciences, 1875&ndash;1878, in J. Willard Gibbs' memoir &lsquo;On the equilibrium of
heterogeneous substances:&rsquo; and in a clearer and more accessible form in H. W.
Bakhuis Roozeboom's papers, Rec. trav. chim., Vol. VI., and in W. Meyerhoffer's memoir
<i>Die Phasenregel und ihre Anwendungen</i>, 1893, to which sources we refer those desiring
fuller information respecting this law). Gibbs calls &lsquo;<i>bodies</i>&rsquo; substances (simple or compound)
capable of forming homogeneous complexes (for instance, solutions or intercombinations)
of a varied composition; a <i>phase</i>&mdash;a mechanically separable portion of such
bodies or of their homogeneous complexes (for instance, a vapour, liquid or precipitated
solid), <i>perfect equilibrium</i>&mdash;such a state of bodies and of their complexes as is
characterised by a constant pressure at a constant temperature even under a change in
the amount of one of the component parts (for instance, of a salt in a saturated solution),
while an <i>imperfect equilibrium</i> is such a one for which such a change corresponds with
a change of pressure (for instance, an unsaturated solution). The law of phases consists
in the fact that: <i>n bodies only give a perfect equilibrium when n + 1 phases participate
in that equilibrium</i>&mdash;for example, in the equilibrium of a salt in its saturated solution
in water there are two bodies (the salt and water) and three phases, namely, the salt,
solution, and vapour, which can be mechanically separated from each other, and to this
equilibrium there corresponds a definite tension. At the same time, <i>n bodies may
occur in n + 2 phases, but only at one definite temperature and one pressure</i>; a change
of one of these may bring about another state (perfect or not&mdash;equilibrium stable or
unstable). Thus water when liquid at the ordinary temperature offers two phases
(liquid and vapour) and is in perfect equilibrium (as also is ice below 0°), but water, ice,
and vapour (three phases and only one body) can only be in equilibrium at 0°, and at the
ordinary pressure; with a change of <i>t</i> there will remain either only ice and vapour or
only liquid water and vapour; whilst with a rise of pressure not only will the vapour
pass into the liquid (there again only remain two phases) but also the temperature of
the formation of ice will fall (by about 7° per 1000 atmospheres). The same laws of
phases are applicable to the consideration of the formation of simple or double salts
from saturated solutions and to a number of other purely chemical relations. Thus, for
example, in the above-mentioned instance, when the bodies are KCl, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O,
perfect equilibrium (which here has reference to the solubility) consisting of four phases,
corresponds to the following seven cases, considering only the phases (above 0°)
A = CuCl<sub>2</sub>,2KCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O; B = CuCl<sub>2</sub>KCl; C = CuCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O,KCl, solution and vapour:
(1) A + B + solution + vapour;  (2) A + C + solution + vapour;  (3) A + KCl + solution
+ vapour; (4) A + B + C + vapour (it follows that B + KCl + solution gives A); (5)
A + C + KCl + vapour; (6) B + C + solution + vapour; and (7) B + KCl + solution + vapour.
Thus above 92° A gives B + KCl. The law of phases by bringing complex instances of
chemical reaction under simple physical schemes, facilitates their study in detail and
gives the means of seeking the simplest chemical relations dealing with solutions, dissociation,
double decompositions and similar cases, and therefore deserves consideration,
but a detailed exposition of this subject must be looked for in works on physical
chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_485" id="Footnote_10_485"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_485"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The normal <i>cupric nitrate</i>, CuN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, is obtained as a deliquescent salt of a blue
colour (soluble in water and in alcohol) by dissolving copper or cupric oxide in nitric acid.
It is so easily decomposed by the action of heat that it is impossible to drive off the water
of crystallisation from it before it begins to decompose. During the ignition of the normal
salt the cupric oxide formed enters into combination with the remaining undecomposed
normal salt, and gives a basic salt, CuN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,2CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The same basic salt is obtained
if a certain quantity of alkali or cupric hydroxide or carbonate be added to the solution
of the normal salt, which is even decomposed when boiled with metallic copper, and forms
the basic salt as a green powder, which easily decomposes under the action of heat and
leaves a residue of cupric oxide. The basic salt, having the composition CuN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>,3CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
is nearly insoluble in water.</p>

<p>The normal <i>carbonate of copper</i>, CuCO<sub>3</sub>, occurs in nature, although extremely rarely.
If solutions of cupric salts be mixed with solutions of alkali carbonates, then, as in the
case of magnesium, carbonic anhydride is evolved and basic salts are formed, which vary
in composition according to the temperature and conditions of the reaction. By mixing
cold solutions, a voluminous blue precipitate is formed, containing an equivalent proportion
of cupric hydroxide and carbonate (after standing or heating, its composition
is the same as malachite, sp. gr. 3·51: 2CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 2Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = CuCO<sub>3</sub>,CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
+ 2Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>. If the resultant blue precipitate be heated in the liquid, it loses water
and is transformed into a granular green mass of the composition Cu<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> into a
compound of the normal salt with anhydrous cupric oxide. This salt of the oxide corresponds
with orthocarbonic acid, C(OH)<sub>4</sub> = CH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> where 4H is replaced by 2Cu. On
further boiling this salt loses a portion of the carbonic acid, forming black cupric oxide,
so unstable is the compound of copper with carbonic anhydride. Another basic salt which
occurs in nature, 2CuCO<sub>3</sub>,CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is known as azurite, or blue carbonate of copper; it
also loses carbonic acid when boiled with water. On mixing a solution of cupric sulphate
with sodium sesquicarbonate no precipitate is at first obtained, but after boiling a precipitate
is formed having the composition of malachite. Debray obtained artificial
azurite by heating cupric nitrate with chalk.</p></div>

Cu, present a complete crystallographic resemblance; (2) that in all respects the Rb
salts present a transition between the K and Cs salts; (3) that the Cs salts form
crystals most easily, and the K salts the most difficultly, and that for the K salts of Cd
and Mn it was even impossible to obtain well-formed crystals; (4) that notwithstanding
the closeness of their angles, the general appearance (habit) of the potassium compound
differs very clearly from the Cs salts, while the Rb salts present a distinct transition in
this respect; (5) that the angle of the inclination of one of the axes to the plane of the two
other axes showed that in the K salts (angle from 75° to 75° 38&#8242;) the inclination is least,
in the Cs salts (from 72° 52&#8242; to 73° 50&#8242;) greatest, and in the Rb salts (from 73° 57&#8242; to
74° 42&#8242;) intermediate between the two; the replacement of Mg &hellip; Cu produces but a
very small change in this angle; (6) that the other angles and the ratio of the
axes of the crystals exhibit a similar variation; and (7) that thus the variation of the
form is chiefly determined by the atomic weight of the alkaline metal. As an example
we cite the magnitude of the inclination of the axes of R<sub>2</sub>M(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

Note <a href="#Footnote_35_445">35</a>) respecting the combination of CuSO<sub>4</sub> with water and ammonia, we may add
that Lachinoff (1893) showed that CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O loses 4&frac34;H<sub>2</sub>O at 180°, that CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>
also loses 4&frac34;NH<sub>3</sub> at 320°, and that only &frac14;<sub>2</sub>O and &frac14;NH<sub>3</sub> remain in combination with
the CuSO<sub>4</sub>. The last &frac14;H<sub>2</sub>O can only be driven off by heating to 200°, and the last
&frac14;NH<sub>3</sub> by heating to 360°. Ammonia displaces water from CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, but water
cannot displace the ammonia from CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>. If hydrochloric acid gas be passed
over CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O at the ordinary temperature, it first forms CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O,3HCl, and
then CuSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O,2HCl. When air is passed over the latter compound it passes into
CuSO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O with a small amount of HCl (about &#8539;HCl). At 100° CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O in a
stream of hydrochloric acid gas gives CuSO<sub>4</sub>,&frac14;H<sub>2</sub>O,2HCl, and then CuSO<sub>4</sub>,&frac14;H<sub>2</sub>O,HCl,
whilst after prolonged heating CuSO<sub>4</sub> remains, which rapidly passes into CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O
when placed under a bell jar over water. Over sulphuric acid, however, CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O
only parts with 3H<sub>2</sub>O, and if CuSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O be placed over water it again forms
CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, and so on.</p></div>

extracted from the residue, which will contain the larger portion of the ferric

(London) is largely used (since 1883). It contains 55 p.c. Cu, and 41 p.c. Zn, the
remaining 4 p.c. being composed of iron (as much as 3&frac12; p.c., which is first alloyed with
zinc), or of cobalt, and manganese, and certain other metals. The sp. gr. of delta metal
is 8·4. It melts at 950°, and then becomes so fluid that it fills up all the cavities in a
mould and forms excellent castings. It has a tensile strength of 70 kilos per sq. mm.
(gun metal about 20, phosphor bronze about 30). It is very soft, especially when heated
to 600°, but after forging and rolling it becomes very hard; it is more difficultly acted
upon by air and water than other kinds of brass, and preserves its golden yellow colour
for any length of time, especially if well polished. It is used for making bearings, screw
propellers, valves, and many other articles. In general the alloys of Cu and Zn containing
about &#8532; p.c. by weight of copper were for a long time almost exclusively made in
Sweden and England (Bristol, Birmingham). These alloys for the most part are cheaper,
harder, and more fusible than copper alone, and form good castings. The alloys containing
45&ndash;80 p.c. Cu crystallise in cubes if slowly cooled (Bi also gives crystals). By
washing the surface of brass with dilute sulphuric acid, Zn is removed and the article
acquires the colour of copper. The alloys approaching Zn<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub> in their composition
exhibit the greatest resistance (under other equal conditions; of purity, forging, rolling,
&amp;c.) The addition of 3 p.c. Al, or 5 p.c. Sn, improves the quality of brass. Respecting
aluminium bronze <i>see</i> Chapter XVII. p. <a href="#Page_88">88</a>.</p></div>

alloys of antimony and copper with lead, came to the conclusion that only two definite
compounds of antimony and copper exist, whilst the other alloys are either alloys of these
two together or with antimony or with copper. These compounds are Cu<sub>2</sub>Sb and
Cu<sub>4</sub>Sb&mdash;one corresponds with the maximum, and the other with the minimum, electrical
resistance. In general, the resistance offered to an electrical current forms one of the
methods by which the composition of definite alloys (for example, Pb<sub>2</sub>Zn<sub>7</sub>) is often
established, whilst the electromotive force of alloys affords (Laurie, 1888) a still more
accurate method&mdash;for instance, several definite compounds were discovered by this
method among the alloys of copper with zinc and tin; but we will not enter into any
details of this subject, because we avoid all references to electricity, although the reader
is recommended to make himself acquainted with this branch of science, which has many
points in common with chemistry. The study of alloys regarded as solid solutions should,
in my opinion, throw much light upon the question of solutions, which is still obscure
in many aspects and in many branches of chemistry.</p></div>

<p>As the value of silver depends exclusively on its purity, and as there is no possibility
of telling the amount of impurities alloyed with it from its external appearance, it is
customary in most countries to mark an article with the amount of pure silver it contains
after an accurately-made analysis known as the assay of the silver. In France the
assay of silver shows the amount of pure silver in 1,000 parts by weight; in Russia the
amount of pure silver in 96 parts&mdash;that is, the assay shows the number of zolotniks
(4·26 grams) of pure silver in one pound (410 grams) of alloyed silver. Russian silver is
generally 84 assay&mdash;that is, contains 84 parts by weight of pure silver and 12 parts of
copper and other metals. French money contains 90 p.c. (in the Russian system this
will be 86·4 assay) by weight of silver [English coins and jewellery contain 92·5 p.c. of
silver]; the silver rouble is of 83&#8531; assay&mdash;that is, it contains 86·8 p.c. of silver&mdash;and the
smaller Russian silver coinage is of 48 assay, and therefore contains 50 p.c. of silver.
Silver ornaments and articles are usually made in Russia of 84 and 72 assay. As
the alloys of silver and copper, especially after being subjected to the action of heat, are
not so white as pure silver, they generally undergo a process known as &lsquo;blanching&rsquo; (or
&lsquo;pickling&rsquo;) after being worked up. This consists in removing the copper from the surface
of the article by subjecting it to a dark-red heat and then immersing it in dilute acid.
During the calcination the copper on the surface is oxidised, whilst the silver remains
unchanged; the dilute acid then dissolves the copper oxides formed, and pure silver is
left on the surface. The surface is dull after this treatment, owing to the removal of a
portion of the metal by the acid. After being polished the article acquires the desired
lustre and colour, so as to be indistinguishable from a pure silver object. In order to
test a silver article, a portion of its mass must be taken, not from the surface, but to a
certain depth. The methods of assay used in practice are very varied. The commonest
and most often used is that known as <i>cupellation</i>. It is based on the difference in the
oxidisability of copper, lead, and silver. The cupel is a porous cup with thick sides,
made by compressing bone ash. The porous mass of bone ash absorbs the fused oxides,
especially the lead oxide, which is easily fusible, but it does not absorb the unoxidised
metal. The latter collects into a globule under the action of a strong heat in the cupel,
and on cooling solidifies into a button, which may then be weighed. Several cupels are
placed in a muffle. A muffle is a semi-cylindrical clay vessel, shown in the accompanying
drawing. The sides of the muffle are pierced with several orifices, which allow the access
of air into it. The muffle is placed in a furnace, where it is strongly heated. Under the
action of the air entering the muffle the copper of the silver alloy is oxidised, but as the
oxide of copper is infusible, or, more strictly speaking, difficultly fusible, a certain quantity
of lead is added to the alloy; the lead is also oxidised by the air at the high temperature
of the muffle, and gives the very fusible lead oxide. The copper oxide then
fuses with the lead oxide, and is absorbed by the cupel, whilst the silver remains as a
bright white globule. If the weight of the alloy taken and of the silver left on the cupel
be determined, it is possible to calculate the composition of the alloy. Thus the essence
of cupellation consists in the separation of the oxidisable metals from silver, which does
not oxidise under the action of heat. A more accurate method, based on the precipitation
of silver from its solutions in the form of silver chloride, is described in detail in works
on analytical chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_492" id="Footnote_14_492"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_492"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> In America, whence the largest amount of silver is now obtained, ores are worked
containing not more than &#8533; p.c. of silver, whilst at &frac12; p.c. its extraction is very profitable.
Moreover, the extraction of silver from ores containing not more than 0·01 p.c. of this
metal is sometimes profitable. The majority of the lead smelted from galena contains
silver, which is extracted from it. Thus near Arras, in France, an ore is worked
which contains about 65 parts of lead and 0·088 part of silver in 100 parts of ore, which
corresponds with 136 parts of silver in 100,000 parts of lead. At Freiberg, in Saxony, the
ore used (enriched by mechanical dressing) contains about 0·9 of silver, 160 of lead, and
2 of copper in 10,000 parts. In every case the lead is first extracted in the manner
described in Chapter <a href="#Page_99">XVIII.</a>, and this lead will contain all the silver. Not unfrequently
other ores of silver are mixed with lead ores, in order to obtain an argentiferous lead as
the product. The extraction of small quantities of silver from lead is facilitated by the
fact (Pattinson's process) that molten argentiferous lead in cooling first deposits
crystals of pure lead, which fall to the bottom of the cooling vessel, whilst the proportion
of silver in the unsolidified mass increases owing to the removal of the crystals
of lead. The lead is enriched in this manner until it contains <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>400</sub> part of silver, and
is then subjected to cupellation on a larger scale. According to Park's process, zinc is
added to the molten argentiferous lead, and the alloy of Pb and Zn, which first separates
out on cooling, is collected. This alloy is found to contain all the silver previously contained
in the lead. The addition of 0·5 p.c. of aluminium to the zinc (Rossler and Edelman)
facilitates the extraction of the Ag from the resultant alloy besides preventing oxidation;
for, after re-melting, nearly all the lead easily runs off (remains fluid), and
leaves an alloy containing about 30 p.c. Ag and about 70 p.c. Zn. This alloy may be used
as an anode in a solution of ZnCl<sub>2</sub>, when the Zn is deposited on the cathode, leaving the
silver with a small amount of Pb, &amp;c. behind. The silver can be easily obtained pure by
treating it with dilute acids and cupelling.</p>

<p>The ores of silver which contain a larger amount of it are: silver glance, Ag<sub>2</sub>S (sp.
gr. 7·2); argentiferous-copper glance, CuAgS; horn silver or chloride of silver, AgCl;
argentiferous grey copper ore; polybasite, M<sub>9</sub>RS<sub>6</sub> (where M = Ag, Cu, and R = Sb, As),
and argentiferous gold. The latter is the usual form in which gold is found in alluvial
deposits and ores. The crystals of gold from the Berezoffsky mines in the Urals contain
90 to 95 of gold and 5 to 9 of silver, and the Altai gold contains 50 to 65 of gold and 36 to
38 of silver. The proportion of silver in native gold varies between these limits in other
localities. Silver ores, which generally occur in veins, usually contain native silver and
various sulphur compounds. The most famous mines in Europe are in Saxony (Freiberg),
which has a yearly output of as much as 26 tons of silver, Hungary, and Bohemia
(41 tons). In Russia, silver is extracted in the Altai and at Nerchinsk (17 tons). The
richest silver mines known are in America, especially in Chili (as much as 70 tons),
Mexico (200 tons), and more particularly in the Western States of North America. The
richness of these mines may be judged from the fact that one mine in the State of
Nevada (Comstock, near Washoe and the cities of Gold Hill and Virginia), which was discovered
in 1859, gave an output of 400 tons in 1866. In place of cupellation, chlorination
may also be employed for extracting silver from its ores. The method of
chlorination consists in converting the silver in an ore into silver chloride. This is
either done by a wet or by a dry method, roasting the ore with NaCl. When the silver
chloride is formed, the extraction of the metal is also done by two methods. The first
consists in the silver chloride being reduced to metal by means of iron in rotating
barrels, with the subsequent addition of mercury which dissolves the silver, but
does not act on the other metals. The mercury holding the silver in solution is distilled,
when the silver remains behind. This method is called <i>amalgamation</i>. The other
method is less frequently used, and consists in dissolving the silver chloride in sodium
chloride or in sodium thiosulphate, and then precipitating the silver from the solution.
The amalgamation is then carried on in rotating barrels containing the roasted ore mixed
with water, iron, and mercury. The iron reduces the silver chloride by taking up the
chlorine from it. The technical details of these processes are described in works on
metallurgy. The extraction of AgCl by the wet method is carried on (Patera's process)
by means of a solution of hyposulphite of sodium which dissolves AgCl (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_23_509">23</a>), or
by lixiviating with a 2 p.c. solution of a double hyposulphite of Na and Cu (obtained by
adding CuSO<sub>4</sub> to Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). The resultant solution of AgCl is first treated with soda
to precipitate PbCO<sub>3</sub>, and then with Na<sub>2</sub>S, which precipitates the Ag and Au. The
process should be carried on rapidly to prevent the precipitation of Cu<sub>2</sub>S from the solution
of CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_493" id="Footnote_15_493"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_493"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> There is another practical method which is also suitable for separating the silver
from the solutions obtained in photography, and consists in precipitating the silver by
oxalic acid. In this case the amount of silver in the solution must be known, and 23
grams of oxalic acid dissolved in 400 grams of water must be added for every 60 grams
of silver in solution in a litre of water. A precipitate of silver oxalate, Ag<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, is then
obtained, which is insoluble in water but soluble in acids. Hence, if the liquid contain
any free acid it must be previously freed from it by the addition of sodium carbonate.
The resultant precipitate of silver oxalate is dried, mixed with an equal weight of dry
sodium carbonate, and thrown into a gently-heated crucible. The separation of the
silver then proceeds without an explosion, whilst the silver oxalate if heated alone
decomposes with explosion.</p>

<p>According to Stas, the best method for obtaining silver from its solutions is by the
reduction of silver chloride dissolved in ammonia by means of an ammoniacal solution of
cuprous thiosulphate; the silver is then precipitated in a crystalline form. A solution of
ammonium sulphite may be used instead of the cuprous salt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_494" id="Footnote_16_494"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_494"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Silver is very malleable and ductile; it may be beaten into leaves 0·002 mm. in
thickness. Silver wire may be made so fine that 1 gram is drawn into a wire 2&frac12; kilometres
long. In this respect silver is second only to gold. A wire of 2 mm. diameter
breaks under a strain of 20 kilograms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_495" id="Footnote_17_495"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_495"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> In melting, silver absorbs a considerable amount of oxygen, which is disengaged on
solidifying. One volume of molten silver absorbs as much as 22 volumes of oxygen. In
solidifying, the silver forms cavities like the craters of a volcano, and throws off metal,
owing to the evolution of the gas; all these phenomena recall a volcano on a miniature
scale (Dumas). Silver which contains a small quantity of copper or gold, &amp;c., does not
show this property of dissolving oxygen.</p>

<p>The absorption of oxygen by molten silver is, however, an oxidation, but it is at the
same time a phenomenon of solution. One cubic centimetre of molten silver can
dissolve twenty-two cubic centimetres of oxygen, which, even at 0°, only weighs 0·03
gram, whilst 1 cubic centimetre of silver weighs at least 10 grams, and therefore it is
impossible to suppose that the absorption of the oxygen is attended by the formation of
any definite compound (rich in oxygen) of silver and oxygen (about 45 atoms of silver to
1 of oxygen) in any other but a dissociated form, and this is the state in which substances
in solution must be regarded (Chapter <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_40">I.</a>)</p>

<p>Le Chatelier showed that at 300° and 15 atmospheres pressure silver absorbs so
much oxygen that it may be regarded as having formed the compound Ag<sub>4</sub>O, or a
mixture of Ag<sub>2</sub> and Ag<sub>2</sub>O. Moreover, silver oxide, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, only decomposes at 300° under
low pressures, whilst at pressures above 10 atmospheres there is no decomposition at
300° but only at 400°.</p>

<p>Stas showed that silver is oxidised by air in the presence of acids. V. d. Pfordten
confirmed this, and showed that an acidified solution of potassium permanganate rapidly
dissolves silver in the presence of air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_496" id="Footnote_18_496"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_496"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> When solutions of AgNO<sub>3</sub>, FeSO<sub>4</sub>, sodium citrate, and NaHO are mixed together
in the manner described above, they throw down a precipitate of a beautiful lilac
colour; when transferred to a filter paper the precipitate soon changes colour, and
becomes dark blue. To obtain the substance as pure as possible it is washed with a
5&ndash;10 p.c. solution of ammonium nitrate; the liquid is decanted, and 150 c.c. of water
poured over the precipitate. It then dissolves entirely in the water. A small quantity of
a saturated solution of ammonium nitrate is added to the solution, and the silver
in solution again separates out as a precipitate. These alternate solutions and
precipitations are repeated seven or eight times, after which the precipitate is transferred
to a filter and washed with 95 p.c. alcohol until the filtrate gives no residue on
evaporation. An analysis of the substance so obtained showed that it contained from
97·18 p.c. to 97·31 p.c. of metallic silver. It remained to discover what the remaining
2&ndash;3 p.c. were composed of. Are they merely impurities, or is the substance some compound
of silver with oxygen or hydrogen, or does it contain citric acid in combination
which might account for its solubility? The first supposition is set aside by the fact
that no gases are disengaged by the precipitate of silver, either under the action of gases
or when heated. The second supposition is shown to be impossible by the fact that
there is no definite relation between the silver and citric acid. A determination of the
amount of silver in solution showed that the amount of citric acid varies greatly for one
and the same amount of silver, and there is no simple ratio between them. Among
other methods of preparing soluble silver given by Carey Lea, we may mention the
method published by him in 1891. AgNO<sub>3</sub> is added to a solution of dextrine in caustic
soda or potash; at first a precipitate of brown oxide of silver is thrown down, but the
brown colour then changes into a reddish chocolate, owing to the reduction of the silver
by the dextrine, and the solution turns a deep red. A few drops of this solution turn
water bright red, and give a perfectly transparent liquid. The dextrine solution is prepared
by dissolving 40 grams of caustic soda and the same amount of ordinary brown
dextrine in two litres of water. To this solution is gradually added 28 grams of AgNO<sub>3</sub>
dissolved in a small quantity of water.</p>

<p>The insoluble allotropic silver is obtained, as was mentioned above, from a solution
of silver prepared in the manner described, by the addition of sulphate of copper,
iron, barium, magnesium, &amp;c. In one experiment Lea succeeded in obtaining the
insoluble allotropic Ag in a crystalline form. The red solution, described above, after
standing several weeks, deposits crystals spontaneously in the form of short black
needles and thin prisms, the liquid becoming colourless. This insoluble variety, when
rubbed upon paper, has the appearance of bright shining green flakes, which polarise
light.</p>

<p>The gold variety is obtained in a different manner to the two other varieties. A
solution is prepared containing 200 c.c. of a 10 p.c. solution of nitrate of silver, 200 c.c.
of a 20 p.c. solution of Rochelle salt, and 800 c.c. of water. Just as in the previous case
the reaction consisted in the reduction of the citrate of silver, so in this case it consists
in the reduction of the tartrate, which here first forms a red, and then a black precipitate
of allotropic Ag, which, when transferred to the filter, appears of a beautiful bronze
colour. After washing and drying, this precipitate acquires the lustre and colour
peculiar to polished gold, and this is especially remarked where the precipitate comes
into contact with glass or china. An analysis of the golden variety gave a percentage
composition of 98·750 to 98·749 Ag. Both the insoluble varieties (the blue and gold)
have a different specific gravity from ordinary silver. Whilst that of fused silver is 10·50,
and of finely-divided silver 10·62, the specific gravity of the blue insoluble variety is 9·58,
and of the gold variety 8·51. The gold variety passes into ordinary Ag with great ease.
This transition may even be remarked on the filter in those places which have accidentally
not been moistened with water. A simple shock, and therefore friction of one
particle upon another, is enough to convert the gold variety into normal white silver.
Carey Lea sent samples of the gold variety for a long distance by rail packed in three
tubes, in which the silver occupied about the quarter of their volume; in one tube only
he filled up this space with cotton-wool. It was afterwards found that the shaking of
the particles of Ag had completely converted it into ordinary white silver, and that only
the tube containing the cotton-wool had preserved the golden variety intact.</p>

<p>The soluble variety of Ag also passes into the ordinary state with great ease, the
heat of conversion being, as Prange showed in 1890, about +60 calories.</p></div>

heating it to 100° in a stream of hydrogen. Water and argentous citrate are then
formed, and the latter, although but slightly soluble in water, gives a reddish-brown
solution of colloid silver (Note <a href="#Footnote_18_496">18</a>), and when boiled this solution becomes
colourless and deposits metallic silver, the argentic salt being again formed. Wöhler,
who discovered this oxide, obtained it as a black precipitate by adding potassium
hydroxide to the above solution of argentous citrate. With hydrochloric acid the
suboxide gives a brown compound, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl. Since the discovery of soluble silver the
above data cannot be regarded as perfectly trustworthy; it is probable that a mixture of
Ag<sub>2</sub> and Ag<sub>2</sub>O was being dealt with, so that the actual existence of Ag<sub>4</sub>O is now
doubtful, but there can be no doubt as to the formation of a subchloride, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl (<i>see</i>
Note <a href="#Footnote_25_512">25</a>), corresponding to the suboxide. The same compound is obtained by the action
of light on the higher chloride. Other acids do not combine with silver suboxide, but
convert it into an argentic salt and metallic silver. In this respect cuprous oxide
presents a certain resemblance to these suboxides. But copper forms a suboxide of
the composition Cu<sub>4</sub>O, which is obtained by the action of an alkaline solution of
stannous oxide on cupric hydroxide, and is decomposed by acids into cupric salts and
metallic copper. The problems offered by the suboxides, as well as by the peroxides,
cannot be considered as fully solved.</p></div>

needles with a metallic lustre, which occasionally attain a somewhat considerable size,
are then formed. They are insoluble in water, and decompose with the evolution of
oxygen when they are dried and heated, especially up to 150°, and, like lead dioxide,
barium peroxide, &amp;c., their action is strongly oxidising. When treated with acids, oxygen
is evolved and a salt of the oxide formed. Silver peroxide absorbs sulphurous anhydride
and forms silver sulphate. Hydrochloric acid evolves chlorine; ammonia reduces the
silver, and is itself oxidised, forming water and gaseous nitrogen. Analyses of the above-mentioned

oxide be left in a strong solution of ammonia it gives a black mass, which easily decomposes
with a loud explosion, especially when struck. This black substance is called
fulminating silver. Probably this is a compound like the other compounds of oxides
with ammonia, and in exploding the oxygen of the silver oxide forms water with the
hydrogen of the ammonia, which is naturally accompanied by the evolution of heat and
formation of gaseous nitrogen, or, as Raschig states, fulminating silver contains NAg<sub>3</sub> or
one of the amides (for instance, NHAg<sub>2</sub> = NH<sub>3</sub> + Ag<sub>2</sub>O - H<sub>2</sub>O). Fulminating silver is also
formed when potassium hydroxide is added to a solution of silver nitrate in ammonia.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_506" id="Footnote_22_506"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_506"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> So that we here encounter the following phenomena: copper displaces silver from
the solutions of its salts, and silver oxide displaces copper oxide from cupric salts.
Guided by the conceptions enunciated in Chapter <a href="#Page_1">XV.</a>, we can account for this in the
following manner: The atomic volume of silver = 10·3, and of copper = 7·2, of silver
oxide = 32, and of copper oxide = 13. A greater contraction has taken place in the formation
of cupric oxide, CuO, than in the formation of silver oxide, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, since in the
former (13 - 7 = 6) the volume after combination with the oxygen has increased by very
little, whilst the volume of silver oxide is considerably greater than that of the metal it
contains [32 - (2 × 10·3) = 11·4]. Hence silver oxide is less compact than cupric oxide,
and is therefore less stable; but, on the other hand, there are greater intervals
between the atoms in silver oxide than in cupric oxide, and therefore silver oxide is able to
give more stable compounds than those of copper oxide. This is verified by the figures
and data of their reactions. It is impossible to calculate for cupric nitrate, because this
salt has not yet been obtained in an anhydrous state; but the sulphates of both oxides
are known. The specific gravity of copper sulphate in an anhydrous state is 3·53, and of
silver sulphate 5·36; the molecular volume of the former is 45, and of the latter 58.
The group SO<sub>3</sub> in the copper occupies, as it were, a volume 45 - 13 = 32, and in the silver
salt a volume 58 - 32 = 26; hence a smaller contraction has taken place in the formation
of the copper salt from the oxide than in the formation of the silver salt, and consequently
the latter should be more stable than the former. Hence silver oxide is
able to decompose the salt of copper oxide, whilst with respect to the metals both salts
have been formed with an almost identical contraction, since 58 volumes of the silver
salt contain 21 volumes of metal (difference = 37), and 45 volumes of the copper salt
contain 7 volumes of copper (difference = 38). Besides which, it must be observed that
copper oxide displaces iron oxide, just as silver oxide displaces copper oxide. Silver,
copper, and iron, in the form of oxides, displace each other in the above order, but in the
form of metals in a reverse order (iron, copper, silver). The cause of this order of the
displacement of the oxides lies, amongst other things, in their composition. They have
the composition Ag<sub>2</sub>O, Cu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; the oxide containing a less proportion of oxygen
displaces that containing a larger proportion, because the basic character diminishes
with the increase of contained oxygen.</p>

<p>Copper also displaces mercury from its salts. It may here be remarked that Spring
(1888), on leaving a mixture of dry mercurous chloride and copper for two hours,
observed a distinct reduction, which belongs to the category of those phenomena which
demonstrate the existence of a mobility of parts (<i>i.e.</i> atoms and molecules) in solid substances.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_509" id="Footnote_23_509"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_509"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Silver chloride is almost perfectly insoluble in water, but is somewhat soluble in
water containing sodium chloride or hydrochloric acid, or other chlorides, and many salts,
in solution. Thus at 100°, 100 parts of water saturated with sodium chloride dissolve
0·4 part of silver chloride. Bromide and iodide of silver are less soluble in this respect,
as also in regard to other solvents. It should be remarked that <i>silver chloride dissolves
in solutions of ammonia, potassium cyanide, and of sodium thiosulphate</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.
Silver bromide is almost perfectly analogous to the chloride, but silver iodide is nearly
insoluble in a solution of ammonia. Silver chloride even absorbs dry ammonia gas,
forming very unstable ammoniacal compounds. When heated, these compounds (Vol. I.
p. 250, Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_8_333">8</a>) evolve the ammonia, as they also do under the action of all acids. Silver
chloride enters into double decomposition with potassium cyanide, forming a soluble
double cyanide, which we shall presently describe; it also forms a soluble double salt,
NaAgS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with sodium thiosulphate.</p>

<p>Silver chloride offers different modifications in the structure of its molecule, as is seen
in the variations in the consistency of the precipitate, and in the differences in the action
of light which partially decomposes AgCl (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_25_512">25</a>). Stas and Carey Lea investigated
this subject, which has a particular importance in photography, because silver bromide
also gives <i>photo-salts</i>. There is still much to be discovered in this respect, since Abney
showed that perfectly dry AgCl placed in a vacuum in the dark is not in the least acted
upon when subsequently exposed to light.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_510" id="Footnote_24_510"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_510"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> <i>Silver bromide</i> and <i>iodide</i> (which occur as the minerals bromite and iodite)
resemble the chloride in many respects, but the degree of affinity of silver for iodine is
greater than that for chlorine and bromine, although less heat is evolved (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_28_BIS_519">28 bis</a>).
Deville deduced this fact from a number of experiments. Thus silver chloride, when
treated with hydriodic acid, evolves hydrochloric acid, and forms silver iodide. Finely-divided
silver easily liberates hydrogen when treated with hydriodic acid; it produces
the same decomposition with hydrochloric acid, but in a considerably less degree and
only on the surface. The difference between silver chloride and iodide is especially
remarkable, since the formation of the former is attended with a greater contraction
than that of the latter. The volume of AgCl = 26; of chlorine 27, of silver 10, the sum
= 37, hence a contraction has ensued; and in the formation of silver iodide an expansion
takes place, for the volume of Ag is 10, of I 26, and of AgI 39 instead of 36 (density,
AgCl, 5·59; AgI, 5·67). The atoms of chlorine have united with the atoms of silver
without moving asunder, whilst the atoms of iodine must have moved apart in
combining with the silver. It is otherwise with respect to the metal; the distance
between its atoms in the metal = 2·2, in silver chloride = 3·0, and in silver iodide
= 3·5; hence its atoms have moved asunder considerably in both cases. It is also very
remarkable, as Fizeau observed, that the density of silver iodide increases with a rise of
temperature&mdash;that is, a contraction takes place when it is heated and an expansion when
it is cooled.</p>

<p>In order to explain the fact that in silver compounds the iodide is more stable than
the chloride and oxide, Professor N. N. Beketoff, in his &lsquo;Researches on the Phenomena
of Substitutions&rsquo; (Kharkoff, 1865), proposed the following original hypothesis, which we
will give in almost the words of the author:&mdash;In the case of aluminium, the oxide, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
is more stable than the chloride, Al<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, and the iodide, Al<sub>2</sub>I<sub>6</sub>. In the oxide the amount
of the metal is to the amount of the element combined with it as 54·8 (Al = 27·3) is to 48,
or in the ratio 112 : 100; for the chloride the ratio is = 25 : 100; for the iodide it = 7 : 100.
In the case of silver the oxide (ratio = 1350 : 100) is less stable than the chloride (ratio
= 304 : 100), and the iodide (ratio of the weight of metal to the weight of the halogen
= 85 : 100) is the most stable. From these and similar examples it follows that the most
stable compounds are those in which the weights of the combined substances are equal.
This may be partly explained by the attraction of similar molecules even after their
having passed into combination with others. This attraction is proportional to the
product of the acting masses. In silver oxide the attraction of Ag<sub>2</sub> for Ag<sub>2</sub> = 216 × 216
= 46,656, and the attraction of Ag<sub>2</sub> for O = 216 × 16 = 3,456. The attraction of like molecules
thus counteracts the attraction of the unlike molecules. The former naturally
does not overcome the latter, otherwise there would be a disruption, but it nevertheless
diminishes the stability. In the case of an equality or proximity of the magnitude of
the combining masses, the attraction of the like parts will counteract the stability of the
compound to the least extent&mdash;in other words, with an inequality of the combined masses,
the molecules have an inclination to return to an elementary state, to decompose, which
does not exist to such an extent where the combined masses are equal. There is, therefore,
a tendency for large masses to combine with large, and for small masses to combine
with small. Hence Ag<sub>2</sub>O + 2KI gives K<sub>2</sub>O + 2AgI. The influence of an equality of
masses on the stability is seen particularly clearly in the effect of a rise of temperature.
Argentic, mercuric, auric and other oxides composed of unequal masses, are somewhat
readily decomposed by heat, whilst the oxides of the lighter metals (like water) are not so
easily decomposed by heat. Silver chloride and iodide approach the condition of
equality, and are not decomposed by heat. The most stable oxides under the action of
heat are those of magnesium, calcium, silicon, and aluminium, since they also approach
the condition of equality. For the same reason hydriodic acid decomposes with greater
facility than hydrochloric acid. Chlorine does not act on magnesia or alumina, but it
acts on lime and silver oxide, &amp;c. This is partially explained by the fact that by considering
heat as a mode of motion, and knowing that the atomic heats of the free elements
are equal, it must be supposed that the amount of the motion of atoms (their <i>vis viva</i>) is
equal, and as it is equal to the product of the mass (atomic weight) into the square of the
velocity, it follows that the greater the combining weight the smaller will be the square
of the velocity, and if the combining weights be nearly equal, then the velocities also will
be nearly equal. Hence the greater the difference between the weights of the combined
atoms the greater will be the difference between their velocities. The difference between
the velocities will increase with the temperature, and therefore the temperature of decomposition
will be the sooner attained the greater be the original difference&mdash;that is,
the greater the difference of the weights of the combined substances. The nearer these
weights are to each other, the more analogous the motion of the unlike atoms, and consequently,
the more stable the resultant compound.</p>

<p>The instability of cupric chloride and nitric oxide, the absence of compounds of fluorine
with oxygen, whilst there are compounds of oxygen with chlorine, the greater stability of
the oxygen compounds of iodine than those of chlorine, the stability of boron nitride, and
the instability of cyanogen, and a number of similar instances, where, judging from the above
argument, one would expect (owing to the closeness of the atomic weights) a stability,
show that Beketoff's addition to the mechanical theory of chemical phenomena is still
far from sufficient for explaining the true relations of affinities. Nevertheless, in his
mode of explaining the relative stabilities of compounds, we find an exceedingly interesting
treatment of questions of primary importance. Without such efforts it would be
impossible to generalise the complex data of experimental knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Fluoride of silver</i>, AgF, is obtained by dissolving Ag<sub>2</sub>O or Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in hydrofluoric acid.
It differs from the other halogen salts of silver in being soluble in water (1 part of salt in
0·55 of water). It crystallises from its solution in prisms, AgFH<sub>2</sub>O (Marignac), or AgF<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O
(Pfaundler), which lose their water in vacuo. Güntz (1891), by electrolising a saturated
solution of Ag<sub>2</sub>F, obtained <i>polyfluoride of silver</i>, Ag<sub>2</sub>F, which is decomposed by water
into AgF + Ag. It is also formed by the action of a strong solution of AgF upon finely-divided
(precipitated) silver.</p></div>

solutions of ferrous sulphate, pyrogallol, ferrous oxalate, hydroxylamine, potassium sulphite,
hydroquinone (the last acts particularly well and is very convenient to use), &amp;c. The
chemical processes of photography are of great practical and theoretical interest; but it
would be impossible in this work to enter into this special branch of chemistry, which has as
yet been very little worked out from a theoretical point of view. Nevertheless, we will pause
to consider certain aspects of this subject which are of a purely chemical interest, and
especially the facts concerning <i>subchloride of silver</i>, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_19_499">19</a>), and the photo-salts
(Note <a href="#Footnote_23_509">23</a>). There is no doubt that under the action of light, AgCl becomes darker
in colour, decreases in weight, and probably forms a mixture of AgCl, Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl, and Ag.
But the isolation of the subchloride has only been recently accomplished by Güntz by
means of the Ag<sub>2</sub>F, discovered by him (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_24_510">24</a>). Many chemists (and among them
Hodgkinson) assumed that an oxychloride of silver was formed by the decomposition of
AgCl under the action of light. Carey Lea's (1889) and A. Richardson's (1891) experiments
showed that the product formed does not, however, contain any oxygen at all, and the
change in colour produced by the action of light upon AgCl is most probably due to the
formation of Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl. This substance was isolated by Güntz (1891) by passing HCl over
crystals of Ag<sub>2</sub>F. He also obtained Ag<sub>2</sub>I in a similar manner by passing HI, and Ag<sub>2</sub>S
by passing H<sub>2</sub>S over Ag<sub>2</sub>F. Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl is best prepared by the action of phosphorus trichloride
upon Ag<sub>2</sub>F. At the temperature of its formation Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl has an easily changeable
tint, with shades of violet red to violet black. Under the action of light a similar
(isomeric) substance is obtained, which splits up into AgCl + Ag when heated. With
potassium cyanide Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl gives Ag + AgCN + KCl, whence it is possible to calculate the
heat of formation of Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl; it = 29·7, whilst the heat of formation of AgCl = 29·2&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the
reaction 2AgCl = Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl + Cl corresponds to an absorption of 28·7 major calories. If we
admit the formation of such a compound by the action of light, it is evident that the energy
of the light is consumed in the above reaction. Carey Lea (1892) subjected AgCl, AgBr, and
AgI to a pressure (of course in the dark) of 3,000 atmospheres, and to trituration with
water in a mortar, and observed a change of colour indicating incipient decomposition,
which is facilitated under the action of light by the molecular currents set up (Lermontoff,
Egoroff). The change of colour of the halogen salts of silver under the action of light,
and their faculty of subsequently giving a visible photographic image under the action of
&lsquo;developers,&rsquo; must now be regarded as connected with the decomposition of AgX, leading
to the formation of Ag<sub>2</sub>X, and the different tinted photo-salts must be considered as
systems containing such Ag<sub>2</sub>X's. Carey Lea obtained photo-salts of this kind not only by
the action of light but also in many other ways, which we will enumerate to prove that
they contain the products of an incomplete combination of Ag with the halogens, (for the
salts Ag<sub>2</sub>X must be regarded as such). The photo-salts have been obtained (1) by the
imperfect chlorination of silver; (2) by the incomplete decomposition of Ag<sub>2</sub>O or Ag<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
by alternately heating and treating with a halogen acid; (3) by the action of nitric acid
or Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> upon Ag<sub>2</sub>Cl; (4) by mixing a solution of AgNO<sub>3</sub> with the hydrates of FeO,
MnO and CrO, and precipitating by HCl; (5) by the action of HCl upon the product
obtained by the reduction of citrate of silver in hydrogen (Note <a href="#Footnote_19_499">19</a>), and (<a href="#Footnote_6_477">6</a>) by the action
of milk sugar upon AgNO<sub>3</sub> together with soda and afterwards acidulating with HCl. All
these reactions should lead to the formation of products of imperfect combination with
the halogens and give photo-salts of a similar diversity of colour to those produced
by the action of developers upon the halogen salts of silver after exposure to light.</p></div>

of K<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> are added to the solution of the chloride. Before all the chlorine is precipitated
as AgCl, the precipitate (after shaking) is white (since Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> with 2RCl gives 2AgCl);
but when all the chlorine is thrown down Ag<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub> is formed, which colours the precipitate
reddish-brown. In order to obtain accurate results the liquid should be neutral

obtained, in similar manner to silver chloride, by the addition of potassium cyanide to
silver nitrate. A white precipitate is then formed, which is almost insoluble in boiling
water. It is also, like silver chloride, insoluble in dilute acids. However, it is dissolved
when heated with nitric acid, and both hydriodic and hydrochloric acids act on it, converting
it into silver chloride and iodide. Alkalis, however, do not act on silver cyanide,
although they act on the other haloid salts of silver. Ammonia and solutions of the
cyanides of the alkali metals dissolve silver cyanide, as they do the chloride. In the
latter case double cyanides are formed&mdash;for example, KAgC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. This salt is obtained in
a crystalline state on evaporating a solution of silver cyanide in potassium cyanide. It
is much more stable than silver cyanide itself. It has a neutral reaction, does not
change in the air, and does not smell of hydrocyanic acid. Many acids, in acting on a
solution of this double salt, precipitate the insoluble silver cyanide. Metallic silver dissolves
in a solution of potassium cyanide in the presence of air, with formation of
the same double salt and potassium hydroxide, and when silver chloride dissolves in
potassium cyanide it forms potassium chloride, besides the salt KAgC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>. This double
salt of silver is used in silver plating. For this purpose potassium cyanide is added to
its solution, as otherwise silver cyanide, and not metallic silver, is deposited by the
electric current. If two electrodes&mdash;one positive (silver) and the other negative (copper)&mdash;be
immersed in such a solution, silver will be deposited upon the latter, and the
silver of the positive electrode will be dissolved by the liquid, which will thus preserve
the same amount of metal in solution as it originally contained. If instead of the
negative electrode a copper object be taken, well cleaned from all dirt, the silver
will be deposited in an even coating; this, indeed, forms the mode of <i>silver plating by
the wet method</i>, which is most often used in practice. A solution of one part of silver
nitrate in 30 to 50 parts of water, and mixed with a sufficient quantity of a solution of
potassium cyanide to redissolve the precipitate of silver cyanide formed, gives a dull
coating of silver, but if twice as much water be used the same mixture gives a bright
coating.</p>

<p>Silver plating in the wet way has now replaced to a considerable extent the old
process of <i>dry silvering</i>, because this process, which consists in dissolving silver in
mercury and applying the amalgam to the surface of the objects, and then vaporising
the mercury, offers the great disadvantage of the poisonous mercury fumes. Besides
these, there is another method of silver plating, based on the direct displacement of
silver from its salts by other metals&mdash;for example, by copper. The copper reduces the
silver from its compounds, and the silver separated is deposited upon the copper. Thus
a solution of silver chloride in sodium thiosulphate deposits a coating of silver upon a
strip of copper immersed in it. It is best for this purpose to take pure <i>silver sulphite</i>.
This is prepared by mixing a solution of silver nitrate with an excess of ammonia, and
adding a saturated solution of sodium sulphite and then alcohol, which precipitates
silver sulphite from the solution. The latter and its solutions are very easily decomposed
by copper. Metallic iron produces the same decomposition, and iron and steel articles
may be very readily silver-plated by means of the thiosulphate solution of silver chloride.
Indeed, copper and similar metals may even be silver-plated by means of silver chloride;
if the chloride of silver, with a small amount of acid, be rubbed upon the surface of the
copper, the latter becomes covered with a coating of silver, which it has reduced.</p>

<p>Silver plating is not only applicable to metallic objects, but also to glass, china, &amp;c.
Glass is silvered for various purposes&mdash;for example, glass globes silvered internally are
used for ornamentation, and have a mirrored surface. Common looking-glass silvered
upon one side forms a mirror which is better than the ordinary mercury mirrors, owing
to the truer colours of the image due to the whiteness of the silver. For optical instruments&mdash;for
example, telescopes&mdash;concave mirrors are now made of silvered glass,
which has first been ground and polished into the required form. The <i>silvering of glass</i>
is based on the fact that silver which is reduced from certain solutions deposits itself uniformly
in a perfectly homogeneous and continuous but very thin layer, forming a bright
reflecting surface. Certain organic substances have the property of reducing silver in this
form. The best known among these are certain aldehydes&mdash;for instance, ordinary
acetaldehyde, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, which easily oxidises in the air and forms acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
This oxidation also easily takes place at the expense of silver oxide, when a certain amount
of ammonia is added to the mixture. The oxide of silver gives up its oxygen to the
aldehyde, and the silver reduced from it is deposited in a metallic state in a uniform
bright coating. The same action is produced by certain saccharine substances and
certain organic acids, such as tartaric acid, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_515" id="Footnote_26_515"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_515"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The phenomenon which then takes place is described by Stas as follows, in a manner
which is perfect in its clearness and accuracy: if silver oxide or carbonate be suspended
in water, and an excess of water saturated with chlorine be added, all the silver
is converted into chloride, just as is the case with oxide or carbonate of mercury,
and the water then contains, besides the excess of chlorine, only pure hypochlorous
acid without the least trace of chloric or chlorous acid. If a stream of chlorine be
passed into water containing <i>an excess of silver oxide</i> or silver carbonate while the
liquid is continually agitated, the reaction is the same as the preceding; silver
chloride and hypochlorous acid are formed. But this acid does not long remain in a free
state: it gradually acts on the silver oxide and gives silver hypochlorite, <i>i.e.</i> AgClO.
If, after some time, the current of chlorine be stopped but the shaking continued,
the liquid loses its characteristic odour of hypochlorous acid, while preserving its
energetic decolorising property, because the silver hypochlorite which is formed is easily
soluble in water. In the presence of an excess of silver oxide this salt can be kept for
several days without decomposition, but it is exceedingly unstable when no excess of
silver oxide or carbonate is present. So long as the solution of silver hypochlorite is
shaken up with the silver oxide, it preserves its transparency and bleaching property,
but directly it is allowed to stand, and the silver oxide settles, it becomes rapidly cloudy
and deposits large flakes of silver chloride, so that the black silver oxide which had
settled becomes covered with the white precipitate. The liquid then loses its bleaching
properties and contains silver chlorate, <i>i.e.</i> AgClO<sub>3</sub>, in solution, which has a slightly
alkaline reaction, owing to the presence of a small amount of dissolved oxide. In this
manner the reactions which are consecutively accomplished may be expressed by the
equations:</p>

<p class="title">6Cl<sub>2</sub> + 3Ag<sub>2</sub>O + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 6AgCl + 6HClO;<br />
6HClO + 3Ag<sub>2</sub>O = 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 6AgClO;<br />
6AgClO = 4AgCl + 2AgClO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Hence, Stas gives the following method for the preparation of silver chlorate: A slow
current of chlorine is caused to act on oxide of silver, suspended in water which is kept
in a state of continual agitation. The shaking is continued after the supply of chlorine
has been stopped, in order that the free hypochlorous acid should pass into silver
hypochlorite, and the resultant solution of the hypochlorite is drawn off from the
sediment of the excess of silver oxide. This solution decomposes spontaneously into
silver chloride and chlorate. The pure silver chlorate, AgClO<sub>3</sub>, does not change under
the action of light. The salt is prepared for further use by drying it in dry air at 150°.
It is necessary during drying to prevent the access of any organic matter; this is done by
filtering the air through cotton wool, and passing it over a layer of red-hot copper oxide.</p></div>

certain corrections have been introduced. We give in the context the average results of
van der Plaats and Thomsen's calculations, as well as in <a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a> neglecting the
doubtful thousandths.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_517" id="Footnote_27_517"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_517"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> This hypothesis, for the establishment or refutation of which so many researches
have been made, is exceedingly important, and fully deserves the attention which has
been given to it. Indeed, if it appeared that the atomic weights of all the elements could
be expressed in whole numbers with reference to hydrogen, or if they at least proved to
be commensurable with one another, then it could be affirmed with confidence that the
elements, with all their diversity, were formed of one material condensed or grouped in
various manners into the stable, and, under known conditions, undecomposable groups
which we call the atoms of the elements. At first it was supposed that all the elements
were nothing else but condensed hydrogen, but when it appeared that the atomic weights
of the elements could not be expressed in whole numbers in relation to hydrogen,
it was still possible to imagine the existence of a certain material from which both hydrogen
and all the other elements were formed. If it should transpire that four atoms of this
material form an atom of hydrogen, then the atom of chlorine would present itself as
consisting of 142 atoms of this substance, the weight of whose atom would be equal to
0·25. But in this case the atoms of all the elements should be expressed in whole
numbers with respect to the weight of the atom of this original material. Let us suppose
that the atomic weight of this material is equal to unity, then all the atomic weights
should be expressible in whole numbers relatively to this unit. Thus the atom of one element,
let us suppose, would weigh <i>m</i>, and of another <i>n</i>, but, as both <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> must be
whole numbers, it follows that the atomic weights of all the elements would be commensurable.
But it is sufficient to glance over the results obtained by Stas, and to be
assured of their accuracy, especially for silver, in order to entirely destroy, or at least
strongly undermine, this attractive hypothesis. We must therefore refuse our assent to the
doctrine of the building up from a single substance of the elements known to us. This
hypothesis is not supported either by any known transformation (for one element has never
been converted into another element), or by the commensurability of the atomic weights
of the elements. Although the hypothesis of the formation of all the elements from a
single substance (for which Crookes has suggested the name protyle) is most attractive
in its comprehensiveness, it can neither be denied nor accepted for want of sufficient data.
Marignac endeavoured, however, to overcome Stas's conclusions as to the incommensurability
of the atomic weights by supposing that in his, as in the determinations of all
other observers, there were unperceived errors which were quite independent of the mode
of observation&mdash;for example, silver nitrate might be supposed to be an unstable substance
which changes, under the heatings, evaporations, and other processes to which it is subjected
in the reactions for the determination of the combining weight of silver. It might
be supposed, for instance, that silver nitrate contains some impurity which cannot be
removed by any means; it might also be supposed that a portion of the elements of the
nitric acid are disengaged in the evaporation of the solution of silver nitrate (owing to the
decomposing action of water), and in its fusion, and that we have not to deal with normal
silver nitrate, but with a slightly basic salt, or perhaps an excess of nitric acid which
cannot be removed from the salt. In this case the observed combining weight will not
refer to an actually definite chemical compound, but to some mixture for which there
does not exist any perfectly exact combining relations. Marignac upholds this proposition
by the fact that the conclusions of Stas and other observers respecting the combining
weights determined with the greatest exactitude very nearly agree with the proposition
of the commensurability of the atomic weights&mdash;for example, the combining weight of
silver was shown to be equal to 107·93, so that it only differs by 0·08 from the whole
number 108, which is generally accepted for silver. The combining weight of iodine
proved to be equal to 126·85&mdash;that is, it differs from 127 by 0·15. The combining weights
of sodium, nitrogen, bromine, chlorine, and lithium are still nearer to the whole or round
numbers which are generally accepted. But Marignac's proposition will hardly bear
criticism. Indeed if we express the combining weights of the elements determined by
Stas in relation to hydrogen, the approximation of these weights to whole numbers
disappears, because one part of hydrogen in reality does not combine with 16 parts of
oxygen, but with 15·92 parts, and therefore we shall obtain, taking H = 1, not the above-cited
figures, but for silver 107·38, for bromine 79·55, magnitudes which are still further
removed from whole numbers. Besides which, if Marignac's proposition were true the
combining weight of silver determined by one method&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> by the analysis of silver
chlorate combined with the synthesis of silver chloride&mdash;would not agree well with the
combining weight determined by another method&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> by means of the analysis of silver
iodate and the synthesis of silver iodide. If in one case a basic salt could be obtained,
in the other case an acid salt might be obtained. Then the analysis of the acid salt
would give different results from that of the basic salt. Thus Marignac's arguments
cannot serve as a support for the vindication of Prout's hypothesis.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think it will not be out of place to cite the following passage from a
paper I read before the Chemical Society of London in 1889 (Appendix II.), referring to
the hypothesis of the complexity of the elements recognised in chemistry, owing to the
fact that many have endeavoured to apply the periodic law to the justification of this
idea &lsquo;dating from a remote antiquity, when it was found convenient to admit the existence
of many gods but only one matter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When we try to explain the origin of the idea of a unique primary matter, we easily
trace that, in the absence of deductions from experiment, it derives its origin from the
scientifically philosophical attempt at discovering some kind of unity in the immense
diversity of individualities which we see around. In classical times such a tendency
could only be satisfied by conceptions about the immaterial world. As to the material
world, our ancestors were compelled to resort to some hypothesis, and they adopted the
idea of unity in the formative material, because they were not able to evolve the conception
of any other possible unity in order to connect the multifarious relations of matter.
Responding to the same legitimate scientific tendency, natural science has discovered
throughout the universe a unity of plan, a unity of forces, and a unity of matter; and
the convincing conclusions of modern science compel every one to admit these kinds of
unity. But while we admit unity in many things, we none the less must also explain
the individuality and the apparent diversity which we cannot fail to trace everywhere.
It was said of old &ldquo;Give us a fulcrum and it will become easy to displace the earth.&rdquo;
So also we must say, &ldquo;Give us something that is individualised, and the apparent
diversity will be easily understood.&rdquo; Otherwise, how could unity result in a multitude.</p>

<p>&lsquo;After a long and painstaking research, natural science has discovered the individualities
of the chemical elements, and therefore it is now capable, not only of analysing,
but also of synthesising; it can understand and grasp generality and unity, as well as
the individualised and multifarious. The general and universal, like time and space, like
force and motion, vary uniformly. The uniform admit of interpolations, revealing every
intermediate phase; but the multitudinous, the individualised&mdash;such as ourselves, or the
chemical elements, or the members of a peculiar periodic function of the elements, or
Dalton's multiple proportions&mdash;is characterised in another way. We see in it&mdash;side by
side with a general connecting principle&mdash;leaps, breaks of continuity, points which escape
from the analysis of the infinitely small&mdash;an absence of complete intermediate links.
Chemistry has found an answer to the question as to the causes of multitudes, and while
retaining the conception of many elements, all submitted to the discipline of a general
law, it offers an escape from the Indian Nirvana&mdash;the absorption in the universal&mdash;replacing
it by the individualised. However, the place for individuality is so limited by
the all-grasping, all-powerful universal, that it is merely a point of support for the understanding
of multitude in unity.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_518" id="Footnote_28_518"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_518"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> It might be expected from the periodic law and analogies with the series iron, cobalt,
nickel, copper, zinc, that the atomic weights of the elements of the series osmium,
iridium, platinum, gold, mercury, would rise in this order, and at the time of the establishment
of the periodic law (1869), the determinations of Berzelius, Rose, and others
gave the following values for the atomic weights: Os = 200, Ir = 197, Pt = 198, Au = 196,
Hg = 200. The fulfilment of the expectations of the periodic law was given in the first
place by the fresh determinations (Seubert, Dittmar, and Arthur) of the atomic weight of
platinum, which proved to be nearly 196, if O = 16 (as Marignac, Brauner, and others
propose); in the second place, by the fact that Seubert proved that the atomic weight of
osmium is really less than that of platinum, and approximately Os = 191; and, in the
third place, by the fact that after the researches of Krüss, Thorpe, and Laurie there was
no doubt that the atomic weight of gold is greater than that of platinum&mdash;namely,
nearly 197.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Thus we see in the first place that gold, which possesses a much smaller affinity than Ag,
evolves far less heat than an equivalent amount of copper, giving the same compound, and
in the second place that the combination of copper with one atom of oxygen disengages
more heat than its combination with one atom of a halogen, whilst with silver the reverse
is the case. This is connected with the fact that Cu<sub>2</sub>O is more stable under the action
of heat than Ag<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_520" id="Footnote_29_520"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_520"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Heavy atoms and molecules, although they may present many points of analogy, are
more easily isolated; thus C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>32</sub>, although, like C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, it combines with Br<sub>2</sub>, and has a
similar composition, yet reacts with much greater difficulty than C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and in this it resembles
gold; the heavy atoms and molecules are, so to say, inert, and already saturated by
themselves. Gold in its higher grade of oxidation, Au<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, presents feeble basic properties
and weakly-developed acid properties, so that this oxide of gold, Au<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, may be
referred to the class of feeble acid oxides, like platinic oxide. This is not the case in the
highest known oxides of copper and silver. But in the lower grade of oxidation, aurous
oxide, Au<sub>2</sub>O, gold, like silver and copper, presents basic properties, although they are
not very pronounced. In this respect it stands very close in its properties, although
not in its types of combination (AuX and AuX<sub>3</sub>), to platinum (PtX<sub>2</sub> and PtX<sub>4</sub>) and its
analogues.</p>

<p>As yet the general chemical characteristics of gold and its compounds have not been
fully investigated. This is partly due to the fact that very few researches have been
undertaken on the compounds of this metal, owing to its inaccessibility for working
in large quantities. As the atomic weight of gold is high (Au = 197), the preparation of
its compounds requires that it should be taken in large quantities, which forms an
obstacle to its being fully studied. Hence the facts concerning the history of this metal
are rarely distinguished by that exactitude with which many facts have been established
concerning other elements more accessible, and long known in use.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_BIS_521" id="Footnote_29_BIS_521"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_BIS_521"><span class="label">[29 bis]</span></a> Sonstadt (1872) showed that sea water, besides silver, always contains gold.
Munster (1892) showed that the water of the Norwegian fiords contains about 5 milligrams
of gold per ton (or 5 milliardths)&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a quantity deserving practical attention, and
I think it may be already said that, considering the immeasurable amount of sea water,
in time means will be discovered for profitably extracting gold from sea water by
bringing it into contact with substances capable of depositing gold upon their surface.
The first efforts might be made upon the extraction of salt from sea water, and as the
total amount of sea water may be taken as about 2,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons, it follows
that it contains about 10,000 million tons of gold. The yearly production of gold is about
200 tons for the whole world, of which about one quarter is extracted in Russia. It is
supposed that gold is dissolved in sea water owing to the presence of iodides, which, under
the action of animal organisms, yield free iodine. It is thought (as Professor Konovaloff
mentions in his work upon &lsquo;The Industries of the United States,&rsquo; 1894) that
iodine facilitates the solution of the gold, and the organic matter its precipitation.
These facts and considerations to a certain extent explain the distribution of gold in
veins or rock fissures, chiefly filled with quartz, because there is sufficient reason for
supposing that these rocks once formed the ocean bottom. R. Dentrie, and subsequently
Wilkinson, showed that organic matter&mdash;for instance, cork&mdash;and pyrites are able
to precipitate gold from its solutions in that metallic form and state in which it occurs
in quartz veins, where (especially in the deeper parts of vein deposits) gold is frequently
found on the surface of pyrites, chiefly arsenical pyrites. Kazantseff (in Ekaterinburg,
1891) even supposes, from the distribution of the gold in these pyrites, that it occurred
in solution as a compound of sulphide of gold and sulphide of arsenic when it penetrated
into the veins. It is from such considerations that the origin of vein and pyritic gold
is, at the present time, attributed to the reaction of solutions of this metal, the remains
of which are seen in the gold still present in sea water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_522" id="Footnote_30_522"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_522"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> However, in recent times, especially since about 1870, when chlorine (either as a
solution of the gas or as bleaching powder) and bromine began to be applied to the extraction
of finely-divided gold from poor ores (previously roasted in order to drive off arsenic
and sulphur, and oxidise the iron), the extraction of gold from quartz and pyrites,
by the wet method, increases from year to year, and begins to equal the amount
extracted from alluvial deposits. Since the nineties the <i>cyanide process</i> (Chapter
XIII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_13_BIS_791">13 bis</a>) has taken an important place among the wet methods for
extracting gold from its ores. It consists in pouring a dilute solution of cyanide of potassium
(about 500 parts of water and 1 to 4 parts of cyanide of potassium per 1,000 parts
of ore, the amount of cyanide depending upon the richness of the ore) and a mixture
of it with NaCN, (<i>see</i> Chapter XIII., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_12_789">12</a>) over the crushed ore (which need not be
roasted, whilst roasting is indispensable in the chlorination process, as otherwise the
chlorine is used up in oxidising the sulphur, arsenic, &amp;c.) The gold is dissolved
very rapidly even from pyrites, where it generally occurs on the surface in such
fine and adherent particles that it either cannot be mechanically washed away, or,
more frequently is carried away by the stream of water, and cannot be caught by
mechanical means or by the mercury used for catching the gold in the sluices.
Chlorination had already given the possibility of extracting the finest particles of gold;
but the cyanide process enables such pyrites to be treated as could be scarcely worked
by other means. The treatment of the crushed ore by the KCN is carried on in simple
wooden vats (coated with paraffin or tar) with the greatest possible rapidity (in order that
the KCN solution should not have time to change) by a method of systematic lixiviation,
and is completed in 10 to 12 hours. The resultant solution of gold, containing AuK(CN)<sub>2</sub>,
is decomposed either with freshly-made zinc filings (but when the gold settles on the
Zn, the cyanide solution reacts upon the Zn with the evolution of H<sub>2</sub> and formation of
ZnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) or by sodium amalgam prepared at the moment of reaction by the action of an
electric current upon a solution of NaHO poured into a vessel partially immersed in
mercury (the NaCN is renewed continually by this means). The silver in the ore passes
into solution, together with the gold, as in amalgamation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_523" id="Footnote_31_523"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_523"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> But the particles of gold are sometimes so small that a large amount is lost during
the washing. It is then profitable to have recourse to the extraction by chlorine and
KCN (Note <a href="#Footnote_30_522">30</a>).</p>

<p>In speaking of the extraction of gold the following remarks may not be out of
place:</p>

<p>In California advantage is taken of water supplied from high altitudes in order to
have a powerful head of water, with which the rocks are directly washed away, thus
avoiding the greater portion of the mechanical labour required for the exploitation of
these deposits.</p>

<p>The last residues of gold are sometimes extracted from sand by washing them with
mercury, which dissolves the gold. The sand mixed with water is caused to come into
contact with mercury during the washing. The mercury is then distilled.</p>

<p>Many sulphurous ores, even pyrites, contain a small amount of gold. Compounds of
gold with bismuth, BiAu<sub>2</sub>, tellurium, AuTe<sub>2</sub> (calverite), &amp;c., have been found, although
rarely.</p>

<p>Among the minerals which accompany gold, and from which the presence of gold may
be expected, we may mention white quartz, titanic and magnetic iron ores, and also the
following, which are of rarer occurrence: zircon, topaz, garnet, and such like. The concentrated
gold washings first undergo a mechanical treatment, and the impure gold
obtained is treated for pure gold by various methods. If the gold contain a considerable
amount of foreign metals, especially lead and copper, it is sometimes cupelled, like silver,
so that the oxidisable metals may be absorbed by the cupel in the form of oxides, but in
every case the gold is obtained together with silver, because the latter metal also is not
oxidised. Sometimes the gold is extracted by means of mercury, that is, by amalgamation
(and the mercury subsequently driven off by distillation), or by smelting it with
lead (which is afterwards removed by oxidation) and processes like those employed for
the extraction of silver, because gold, like silver, does not oxidise, is dissolved by lead
and mercury, and is non-volatile. If copper or any other metal contain gold and it be
employed as an anode, pure copper will be deposited upon the cathode, while all the
gold will remain at the anode as a slime. This method often amply repays the whole
cost of the process, since it gives, besides the gold, a pure electrolytic copper.</p></div>

by the action of a mixture of solutions of cerium acetate and NaHO upon a solution of
AuCl<sub>3</sub>. The gold separates out from such a solution in exactly the same manner as Ag
does from the solution of colloid silver mentioned above. There always remains a
certain amount of a higher oxide of cerium, CeO<sub>2</sub>, in the solution&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the gold is
reduced by converting the cerium into a higher grade of oxidation. Besides which
Krüss and Hofmann showed that sulphide of gold precipitated by the action of H<sub>2</sub>S upon
a solution of AuKCy<sub>2</sub> mixed with HCl easily passes into a colloid solution after being
properly washed (like As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, CuS, &amp;c., Chapter I., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_57_104">57</a>).</p></div>

it is glued by means of varnish, &amp;c.), and is about 0·003 millimetre thick. It is obtained
from thin sheets (weighing at first about &frac14; grm. to a square inch), rolled between gold
rollers, by gradually hammering them (in packets of a number at once) between sheets
of moist (but not wet) parchment, and then, after cutting them into four pieces, between
a specially prepared membrane, which, when at the right degree of moisture, does not
tear or stick together under the blows of the hammer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_526" id="Footnote_32_526"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_526"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> The formation of the alloys Cu + Zn, Cu + Sn, Cu + Bi, Cu + Sb, Pb + Sb, Ag + Pb,
Ag + Sn, Au + Zn, Au + Sn, &amp;c., is accompanied by a contraction (and evolution of heat).
The formation of the alloys Fe + Sb, Fe + Pb, Cu + Pb, Pb + Sn, Pb + Sb,
Zn + Sb, Ag + Cu, Au + Cu, Au + Pb, takes place with a certain increase in volume.
With regard to the alloys of gold, it may be mentioned that gold is only slightly
dissolved by mercury (about 0·06 p.c., Dudley, 1890); the remaining portion forms a
granular alloy, whose composition has not been definitely determined. Aluminium (and
silicon) also have the capacity of forming alloys with gold. The presence of a small
amount of aluminium lowers the melting point of gold considerably (Roberts-Austen,
1892); thus the addition of 4 p.c. of aluminium lowers it by 14°·28, the addition of 10 p.c.
Al by 41°·7. The latter alloy is white. The alloy AuAl<sub>2</sub> has a characteristic purple
colour, and its melting point is 32°·5 above that of gold, which shows it to be a definite
compound of the two metals. The melting points of alloys richer in Al gradually fall
to 660°&mdash;that is, below that of aluminium (665°).</p>

<p>Heycock and Neville (1892), in studying the triple alloys of Au, Cd, and Sn, observed
a tendency in the gold to give compounds with Cd, and by sealing a mixture of Au and Cd
in a tube, from which the air had been exhausted, and heating it, they obtained a grey
crystalline brittle definite alloy AuCd.</p></div>

peculiar alteration sometimes found on the surface of dead-gold articles, there appearing
brownish and blackish spots, which widen and alter their form in course of time. He
came to the conclusion that these spots are due to the appearance and development of
peculiar micro-organisms (Aspergillus niger and Micrococcus cimbareus) on the gold,
spores of which were found in abundance on the cotton-wool in which the gold articles
had been kept.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_528" id="Footnote_33_528"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_528"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Stannous chloride as a reducing agent also acts on auric chloride, and gives a red
precipitate known as <i>purple of Cassius</i>. This substance, which probably contains a
mixture or compound of aurous oxide and tin oxide, is used as a red pigment for china
and glass. Oxalic acid, on heating, reduces metallic gold from its salts, and this property
may be taken advantage of for separating it from its solutions. The oxidation which
then takes place in the presence of water may be expressed by the following equation:
2AuCl<sub>3</sub> + 3C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> = 2Au + 6HCl + 6CO<sub>2</sub>. Nearly all organic substances have a reducing
action on gold, and solutions of gold leave a violet stain on the skin.</p>

<p>Auric chloride, like platinic chloride, is distinguished for its clearly-developed
property of forming double salts. These double salts, as a rule, belong to the type
AuMCl<sub>4</sub>. The compound of auric chloride with hydrochloric acid mentioned above
evidently belongs to the same type. The compounds 2KAuCl<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O, NaAuCl<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O,
AuNH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, Mg(AuCl<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and the like are easily crystallised in well-formed
crystals. Wells, Wheeler, and Penfield (1892) obtained RbAuCl<sub>4</sub> (reddish yellow) and
CsAuCl<sub>4</sub> (golden yellow), and corresponding bromides (dark coloured). AuBr<sub>3</sub> is extremely
like the chloride. Auric cyanide is obtained easily in the form of a double salt
of potassium, KAu(CN)<sub>4</sub> by mixing saturated and hot solutions of potassium cyanide
with auric chloride and then cooling.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_529" id="Footnote_34_529"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_529"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> If ammonia be added to a solution of auric chloride, it forms a yellow precipitate
of the so-called fulminating gold, which contains gold, chlorine, hydrogen, nitrogen,
and oxygen, but its formula is not known with certainty. It is probably a sort of ammonio-metallic
compound, Au<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>, or amide (like the mercury compound). This
precipitate explodes at 140°, but when left in the presence of solutions containing ammonia
it loses all its chlorine and becomes non-explosive. In this form the composition
Au<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O is ascribed to it, but this is uncertain. Auric sulphide, Au<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, is
obtained by the action of hydrogen sulphide on a solution of auric chloride, and also
directly by fusing sulphur with gold. It has an acid character, and therefore dissolves
in sodium and ammonium sulphides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_530" id="Footnote_35_530"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_530"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Many double salts of suboxide of gold belong to the type AuX&mdash;for instance, the
cyanide corresponding to the type AuKX<sub>2</sub>, like PtK<sub>2</sub>X<sub>4</sub>, with which we became acquainted
in the last chapter. We will enumerate several of the representatives of this class of
compounds. If auric chloride, AuCl<sub>3</sub>, be mixed with a solution of sodium thiosulphate,
the gold passes into a colourless solution, which deposits colourless crystals, containing
a double thiosulphate of gold and sodium, which are easily soluble in water
but are precipitated by alcohol. The composition of this salt is Na<sub>3</sub>Au(S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O.
If the sodium thiosulphate be represented as NaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Na, the double salt in question
will be AuNa(S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Na)<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, according to the type AuNaX<sub>2</sub>. The solution of this
colourless and easily crystallisable salt has a sweet taste, and the gold is not separated
from it either by ferrous sulphate or oxalic acid. This salt, which is known as <i>Fordos
and Gelis's salt</i>, is used in medicine and photography. In general, aurous oxide
exhibits a distinct inclination to the formation of similar double salts, as we saw also
with PtX<sub>2</sub>&mdash;for example, it forms similar salts with sulphurous acid. Thus if a solution
of sodium sulphite be gradually added to a solution of oxide of gold in sodium
hydroxide, the precipitate at first formed re-dissolves to a colourless solution, which
contains the double salt Na<sub>3</sub>Au(SO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = AuNa(SO<sub>3</sub>Na)<sub>2</sub>. The solution of this salt,
when mixed with barium chloride, first forms a precipitate of barium sulphite, and
then a red barium double salt which corresponds with the above sodium salt.</p>

<p>The oxygen compound of the type AuX, <i>aurous oxide</i>, Au<sub>2</sub>O, is obtained as a greenish
violet powder on mixing aurous chloride with potassium chloride in the cold. With
hydrochloric acid this oxide gives gold and auric chloride, and when heated it easily
splits up into oxygen and metallic gold.</p></div>

<p class="title"><span style="font-size: 125%;">AN ATTEMPT TO APPLY TO CHEMISTRY ONE OF THE
PRINCIPLES OF NEWTON'S NATURAL PHILOSOPHY</span></p>

<p class="title"><span style="font-size: 110%;"><span class="smcap">By</span> PROFESSOR MENDELÉEFF</span></p>

<p class="title">A LECTURE DELIVERED AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION OF GREAT BRITAIN ON FRIDAY, MAY 31, 1889</p>

<p>Nature, inert to the eyes of the ancients, has been revealed to us as full of
life and activity. The conviction that motion pervaded all things, which was
first realised with respect to the stellar universe, has now extended to the
unseen world of atoms. No sooner had the human understanding denied to
the earth a fixed position and launched it along its path in space, than it was
sought to fix immovably the sun and the stars. But astronomy has demonstrated
that the sun moves with unswerving regularity through the star-set
universe at the rate of about 50 kilometres per second. Among the so-called
fixed stars are now discerned manifold changes and various orders of movement.
Light, heat, electricity&mdash;like sound&mdash;have been proved to be modes
of motion; to the realisation of this fact modern science is indebted for
powers which have been used with such brilliant success, and which have been
expounded so clearly at this lecture table by Faraday and by his successors.
As, in the imagination of Dante, the invisible air became peopled with spiritual
beings, so before the eyes of earnest investigators, and especially before those
of Clerk Maxwell, the invisible mass of gases became peopled with particles:
their rapid movements, their collisions, and impacts became so manifest that
it seemed almost possible to count the impacts and determine many of
the peculiarities or laws of their collisions. The fact of the existence of
these invisible motions may at once be made apparent by demonstrating the
difference in the rate of diffusion through porous bodies of the light and
rapidly moving atoms of hydrogen and the heavier and more sluggish particles
of air. Within the masses of liquid and of solid bodies we have been
forced to acknowledge the existence of persistent though limited motion of
their ultimate particles, for otherwise it would be impossible to explain, for
example, the celebrated experiments of Graham on diffusion through liquid
and colloidal substances. If there were, in our times, no belief in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
molecular motion in solid bodies, could the famous Spring have hoped to
attain any result by mixing carefully-dried powders of potash, saltpetre and
sodium acetate, in order to produce, by pressure, a chemical reaction between
these substances through the interchange of their metals, and have derived,
for the conviction of the incredulous, a mixture of two hygroscopic though
solid salts&mdash;sodium nitrate and potassium acetate?</p>

<p>In these invisible and apparently chaotic movements, reaching from the
stars to the minutest atoms, there reigns, however, a harmonious order which
is commonly mistaken for complete rest, but which is really a consequence
of the conservation of that dynamic equilibrium which was first discerned
by the genius of Newton, and which has been traced by his successors in the
detailed analysis of the particular consequences of the great generalisation,
namely, relative immovability in the midst of universal and active movement.</p>

<p>But the unseen world of chemical changes is closely analogous to the
visible world of the heavenly bodies, since our atoms form distinct portions
of an invisible world, as planets, satellites, and comets form distinct portions
of the astronomer's universe; our atoms may therefore be compared to the
solar systems, or to the systems of double or of single stars: for example,
ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) may be represented in the simplest manner by supposing
the sun, nitrogen, surrounded by its planets of hydrogen; and common salt
(NaCl) may be looked on as a double star formed of sodium and chlorine.
Besides, now that the indestructibility of the elements has been acknowledged,
chemical changes cannot otherwise be explained than as changes of
motion, and the production by chemical reactions of galvanic currents, of
light, of heat, of pressure, or of steam power, demonstrates visibly that the
processes of chemical reaction are inevitably connected with enormous though
unseen displacements, originating in the movements of atoms in molecules.
Astronomers and natural philosophers, in studying the visible motions of the
heavenly bodies and of matter on the earth, have understood and have estimated
the value of this store of energy. But the chemist has had to pursue
a contrary course. Observing in the physical and mechanical phenomena
which accompany chemical reactions the quantity of energy manifested by
the atoms and molecules, he is constrained to acknowledge that within the
molecules there exist atoms in motion, endowed with an energy which, like
matter itself, is neither being created nor capable of being destroyed. Therefore,
in chemistry, we must seek dynamic equilibrium not only between the
molecules, but also in their midst among their component atoms. Many
conditions of such equilibrium have been determined, but much remains to be
done, and it is not uncommon, even in these days, to find that some chemists
forget that there is the possibility of motion in the interior of molecules, and
therefore represent them as being in a condition of death-like inactivity.</p>

<p>Chemical combinations take place with so much ease and rapidity,
possess so many special characteristics, and are so numerous, that their simplicity
and order were for a long time hidden from investigators. Sympathy,
relationship, all the caprices or all the fancifulness of human intercourse,
seemed to have found complete analogies in chemical combinations, but with
this difference, that the characteristics of the material substances&mdash;such as
silver, for example, or of any other body&mdash;remain unchanged in every subdivision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
from the largest masses to the smallest particles, and consequently
these characteristics must be properties of the particles. But the world of
heavenly luminaries appeared equally fanciful at man's first acquaintance
with it, so much so, that the astrologers imagined a connection between the
individualities of men and the conjunctions of planets. Thanks to the genius
of Lavoisier and of Dalton, man has been able, in the unseen world of chemical
combinations, to recognise laws of the same simple order as those
which Copernicus and Kepler proved to exist in the planetary universe. Man
discovered, and continues every hour to discover, <i>what</i> remains unchanged
in chemical evolution, and <i>how</i> changes take place in combinations of the
unchangeable. He has learned to predict, not only what possible combinations
may take place, but also the very existence of atoms of unknown elementary
substances, and has besides succeeded in making innumerable practical
applications of his knowledge to the great advantage of his race, and has
accomplished this notwithstanding that notions of sympathy and affinity
still preserve a strong vitality in science. At present we cannot apply
Newton's principles to chemistry, because the soil is only being now prepared.
The invisible world of chemical atoms is still waiting for the creator of chemical
mechanics. For him our age is collecting a mass of materials, the
inductions of well-digested facts, and many-sided inferences similar to those
which existed for Astronomy and Mechanics in the days of Newton. It is
well also to remember that Newton devoted much time to chemical experiments,
and while considering questions of celestial mechanics, persistently
kept in view the mutual action of those infinitely small worlds which are
concerned in chemical evolutions. For this reason, and also to maintain the
unity of laws, it seems to me that we must, in the first instance, seek to
harmonise the various phases of contemporary chemical theories with the
immortal principles of the Newtonian natural philosophy, and so hasten the
advent of true chemical mechanics. Let the above considerations serve as
my justification for the attempt which I propose to make to act as a champion
of the universality of the Newtonian principles, which I believe are competent
to embrace every phenomenon in the universe, from the rotation of
the fixed stars to the interchanges of chemical atoms.</p>

<p>In the first place I consider it indispensable to bear in mind that, up to
quite recent times, only a one-sided affinity has been recognised in chemical
reactions. Thus, for example, from the circumstance that red-hot iron decomposes
water with the evolution of hydrogen, it was concluded that oxygen
had a greater affinity for iron than for hydrogen. But hydrogen, in presence
of red-hot iron scale, appropriates its oxygen and forms water, whence an
exactly opposite conclusion may be formed.</p>

<p>During the last ten years a gradual, scarcely perceptible, but most
important change has taken place in the views, and consequently in the
researches, of chemists. They have sought everywhere, and have always
found, systems of conservation or dynamic equilibrium substantially similar
to those which natural philosophers have long since discovered in the visible
world, and in virtue of which the position of the heavenly bodies in the
universe is determined. There where one-sided affinities only were at first
detected, not only secondary or lateral ones have been found, but even those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
which are diametrically opposite; yet among these, dynamical equilibrium
establishes itself not by excluding one or other of the forces, but regulating
them all. So the chemist finds in the flame of the blast furnace, in the
formation of every salt, and, with especial clearness, in double salts and in
the crystallisation of solutions, not a fight ending in the victory of one side,
as used to be supposed, but the conjunction of forces; the peace of dynamic
equilibrium resulting from the action of many forces and affinities. Carbonaceous
matters, for example, burn at the expense of the oxygen of the
air, yielding a quantity of heat, and forming products of combustion, in
which it was thought that the affinities of the oxygen with the combustible
elements were satisfied. But it appeared that the heat of combustion was
competent to decompose these products, to dissociate the oxygen from the
combustible elements, and therefore to explain combustion fully it is necessary
to take into account the equilibrium between opposite reactions, between
those which evolve and those which absorb heat.</p>

<p>In the same way, in the case of the solution of common salt in water, it
is necessary to take into account, on the one hand, the formation of compound
particles generated by the combination of salt with water, and, on the other,
the disintegration or scattering of the new particles formed, as well as of
these originally contained. At present we find two currents of thought,
apparently antagonistic to each other, dominating the study of solutions:
according to the one, solution seems a mere act of building up or association;
according to the other, it is only dissociation or disintegration. The truth
lies, evidently, between these views; it lies, as I have endeavoured to prove
by my investigations into aqueous solutions, in the dynamic equilibrium of
particles tending to combine and also to fall asunder. The large majority of
chemical reactions which appeared to act victoriously along one line have
been proved capable of acting as victoriously even along an exactly opposite
line. Elements which utterly decline to combine directly may often be
formed into comparatively stable compounds by indirect means, as, for example,
in the case of chlorine and carbon; and consequently the sympathies
and antipathies which it was thought to transfer from human relations to
those of atoms should be laid aside until the mechanism of chemical relations
is explained. Let us remember, however, that chlorine, which does not
form with carbon the chloride of carbon, is strongly absorbed, or, as it were,
dissolved, by carbon, which leads us to suspect incipient chemical action even
in an external and purely surface contact, and involuntarily gives rise to
conceptions of that unity of the forces of nature which has been so energetically
insisted on by Sir William Grove and formulated in his famous
paradox. Grove noticed that platinum, when fused in the oxyhydrogen
flame, during which operation water is formed, when allowed to drop into
water decomposes the latter and produces the explosive oxyhydrogen mixture.
The explanation of this paradox, as of many others which arose during the
period of chemical renaissance, has led, in our time, to the promulgation by
Henri Sainte-Claire Deville of the conception of dissociation and of equilibrium,
and has recalled the teaching of Berthollet, which, notwithstanding its
brilliant confirmation by Heinrich Rose and Dr. Gladstone, had not, up to
that period, been included in received chemical views.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>Chemical equilibrium in general, and dissociation in particular, are now
being so fully worked out in detail, and supplied in such various ways, that I
do not allude to them to develop, but only use them as examples by which
to indicate the correctness of a tendency to regard chemical combinations
from points of view differing from those expressed by the term hitherto appropriated
to define chemical forces, namely, &lsquo;affinity.&rsquo; Chemical equilibria,
dissociation, the speed of chemical reactions, thermochemistry, spectroscopy,
and, more than all, the determination of the influence of masses and the
search for a connection between the properties and weights of atoms and
molecules&mdash;in one word, the vast mass of the most important chemical researches
of the present day&mdash;clearly indicate the near approach of the time
when chemical doctrines will submit fully and completely to the doctrine
which was first announced in the <i>Principia</i> of Newton.</p>

<p>In order that the application of these principles may bear fruit it is evidently
insufficient to assume that statical equilibrium reigns alone in chemical
systems or chemical molecules: it is necessary to grasp the conditions of
possible states of dynamical equilibria, and to apply to them kinetic principles.
Numerous considerations compel us to renounce the idea of statical
equilibrium in molecules, and the recent yet strongly-supported appeals to
dynamic principles constitute, in my opinion, the foundation of the modern
teaching relating to atomicity, or the valency of the elements, which usually
forms the basis of investigations into organic or carbon compounds.</p>

<p>This teaching has led to brilliant explanations of very many chemical
relations and to cases of isomerism, or the difference in the properties of
substances having the same composition. It has been so fruitful in its many
applications and in the foreshadowing of remote consequences, especially
respecting carbon compounds, that it is impossible to deny its claims to be
ranked as a great achievement of chemical science. Its practical application
to the synthesis of many substances of the most complicated composition
entering into the structure of organised bodies, and to the creation of an unlimited
number of carbon compounds, among which the colours derived from
coal tar stand prominently forward, surpass the synthetical powers of Nature
itself. Yet this teaching, as applied to the structure of carbon compounds,
is not on the face of it directly applicable to the investigation of other elements,
because in examining the first it is possible to assume that the atoms
of carbon have always a definite and equal number of affinities, whilst in the
combinations of other elements this is evidently inadmissible. Thus, for
example, an atom of carbon yields only one compound with four atoms of
hydrogen and one with four atoms of chlorine in the molecule, whilst the
atoms of chlorine and hydrogen unite only in the proportions of one to one.
Simplicity is here evident, and forms a point of departure from which it is
easy to move forward with firm and secure tread. Other elements are of a
different nature. Phosphorus unites with three and with five atoms of
chlorine, and consequently the simplicity and sharpness of the application of
structural conceptions are lost. Sulphur unites only with two atoms of
hydrogen, but with oxygen it enters into higher orders of combination. The
periodic relationship which exists among all the properties of the elements&mdash;such,
for example, as their ability to enter into various combinations&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
their atomic weights, indicate that this variation in atomicity is subject to
one perfectly exact and general law, and it is only carbon and its near
analogues which constitute cases of permanently preserved atomicity. It is
impossible to recognise as constant and fundamental properties of atoms,
powers which, in substance, have proved to be variable. But by abandoning
the idea of permanence, and of the constant saturation of affinities&mdash;that is
to say, by acknowledging the possibility of free affinities&mdash;many retain a
comprehension of the atomicity of the elements &lsquo;under given conditions;&rsquo;
and on this frail foundation they build up structures composed of chemical
molecules, evidently only because the conception of manifold affinities gives,
at once, a simple statical method of estimating the composition of the most
complicated molecules.</p>

<p>I shall enter neither into details, nor into the various consequences following
from these views, nor into the disputes which have sprung up respecting
them (and relating especially to the number of isomerides possible on the
assumption of free affinities), because the foundation or origin of theories of
this nature suffers from the radical defect of being in opposition to dynamics.
The molecule, as even Laurent expressed himself, is represented as an architectural
structure, the style of which is determined by the fundamental
arrangement of a few atoms, whilst the decorative details, which are capable
of being varied by the same forces, are formed by the elements entering into
the combination. It is on this account that the term &lsquo;structural&rsquo; is so appropriate
to the contemporary views of the above order, and that the &lsquo;structuralists&rsquo;
seek to justify the tetrahedric, plane, or prismatic disposition of
the atoms of carbon in benzene. It is evident that the consideration relates
to the statical position of atoms and molecules and not to their kinetic relations.
The atoms of the structural type are like the lifeless pieces on a chess
board: they are endowed but with the voices of living beings, and are not
those living beings themselves; acting, indeed, according to laws, yet each
possessed of a store of energy which, in the present state of our knowledge,
must be taken into account.</p>

<p>In the days of Haüy, crystals were considered in the same statical and
structural light, but modern crystallographers, having become more thoroughly
acquainted with their physical properties and their actual formation,
have abandoned the earlier views, and have made their doctrines dependent
on dynamics.</p>

<p>The immediate object of this lecture is to show that, starting with
Newton's third law of motion, it is possible to preserve to chemistry all the
advantages arising from structural teaching, without being obliged to build
up molecules in solid and motionless figures, or to ascribe to atoms definite
limited valencies, directions of cohesion, or affinities. The wide extent of
the subject obliges me to treat only a small portion of it, namely of <i>substitutions</i>,
without specially considering combinations and decompositions, and
even then limiting myself to the simplest examples, which, however, will
throw open prospects embracing all the natural complexity of chemical relations.
For this reason, if it should prove possible to form groups similar, for
example, to H<sub>4</sub> or CH<sub>6</sub> as the remnants of molecules CH<sub>4</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>7</sub> we shall
not pause to consider them, because, as far as we know, they fall asunder into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
two parts, H<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>, as soon as they are even temporarily formed,
and are incapable of separate existence, and therefore can take no part in
the elementary act of substitution. With respect to the simplest molecules
which we shall select&mdash;that is to say, those of which the parts have no separate
existence, and therefore cannot appear in substitutions&mdash;we shall consider
them according to the periodic law, arranging them in direct dependence
on the atomic weight of the elements.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, the molecules of the simplest hydrogen compounds&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">Neither the arithmetical order (1, 2, 3, 4 atoms of hydrogen) nor the total
information we possess respecting the elements will permit us to interpolate
into this typical series one more additional element; and therefore we have
here, for hydrogen compounds, a natural base on which are built up those
simple chemical combinations which we take as typical. But even they are
competent to unite with each other, as we see, for instance, in the property
which hydrofluoric acid has of forming a hydrate&mdash;that is, of combining with
water; and a similar attribute of ammonia, resulting in the formation of a
caustic alkali, NH<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, or NH<sub>4</sub>OH.</p>

<p>Having made these indispensable preliminary observations, I may now
attack the problem itself and attempt to explain the so-called structure or
rather construction, of molecules&mdash;that is to say, their constitution and transformations&mdash;without
having recourse to the teaching of &lsquo;structuralists,&rsquo; but on
Newton's dynamical principles.</p>

<p>Of Newton's three laws of motion, only the third can be applied directly
to chemical molecules when regarded as systems of atoms among which it
must be supposed that there exist common influences or forces, and resulting
compounded relative motions. Chemical reactions of every kind are undoubtedly
accomplished by changes in these internal movements, respecting
the nature of which nothing is known at present, but the existence of which
the mass of evidence collected in modern times forces us to acknowledge as
forming part of the common motion of the universe, and as a fact further
established by the circumstance that chemical reactions are always characterised
by changes of volume or the relations between the atoms or the
molecules. Newton's third law, which is applicable to every system, declares
that, &lsquo;action is also associated with reaction, and is equal to it.&rsquo; The
brevity of conciseness of this axiom was, however, qualified by Newton in
a more expanded statement, &lsquo;the action of bodies one upon another are
always equal, and in opposite directions.&rsquo; This simple fact constitutes the
point of departure for explaining dynamic equilibrium&mdash;that is to say, systems
of conservancy. It is capable of satisfying even the dualists, and of explaining,
without additional assumptions, the preservation of those chemical types
which Dumas, Laurent, and Gerhardt created unit types, and those views of
atomic combinations which the structuralists express by atomicity or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
valency of the elements, and, in connection with them, the various numbers
of affinities. In reality, if a system of atoms or a molecule be given, then in
it, according to the third law of Newton, each portion of atoms acts on the
remaining portion in the same manner, and with the same force as the
second set of atoms acts on the first. We infer directly from this consideration
that both sets of atoms, forming a molecule, are not only equivalent with
regard to themselves, as they must be according to Dalton's law, but also that
they may, if united, replace each other. Let there be a molecule containing
atoms A B C, it is clear that, according to Newton's law, the action of A on
B C must be equal to the action of B C on A, and if the first action is directed
on B C, then the second must be directed on A, and consequently then, where
A can exist in dynamic equilibrium, B C may take its place and act in a like
manner. In the same way the action of C is equal to the action of A B. In
one word every two sets of atoms forming a molecule are equivalent to each
other, and may take each other's place in other molecules, or, having the
power of balancing each other, the atoms or their complements are endowed
with the power of replacing each other. Let us call this consequence of an
evident axiom &lsquo;the principle of substitution,&rsquo; and let us apply it to those
typical forms of hydrogen compounds which we have already discussed, and
which, on account of their simplicity, and regularity, have served as starting-points
of chemical argument long before the appearance of the doctrine of
structure.</p>

<p>In the type of hydrofluoric acid, HF, or in systems of double stars, are
included a multitude of the simplest molecules. It will be sufficient for our
purpose to recall a few: for example, the molecules of chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, and of
hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>, and hydrochloric acid, HCl, which is familiar to all in aqueous
solution as spirits of salt, and which has many points of resemblance with
HF, HBr, HI. In these cases division into two parts can only be made in
one way, and therefore the principle of substitution renders it probable that
exchanges between the chlorine and the hydrogen can take place, if they are
competent to unite with each other. There was a time when no chemist
would even admit the idea of any such action; it was then thought that the
power of combination indicated a polar difference of the molecules in combination,
and this thought set aside all idea of the substitution of one component
element by another.</p>

<p>Thanks to the observations and experiments of Dumas and Laurent fifty
years ago, such fallacies were dispelled, and in this manner the principle
of substitution was exhibited. Chlorine and bromine acting on many
hydrogen compounds, occupy immediately the place of their hydrogen, and
the displaced hydrogen, with another atom of chlorine or bromine, forms
hydrochloric acid or bromide of hydrogen. This takes place in all typical
hydrogen compounds. Thus chlorine acts on this principle on gaseous
hydrogen&mdash;reaction, under the influence of light, resulting in the formation
of hydrochloric acid. Chlorine acting on the alkalis, constituted similarly to
water, and even on water itself&mdash;only, however, under the influence of light
and only partially because of the instability of HClO&mdash;forms by this principle
bleaching salts, which are the same as the alkalis, but with their hydrogen
replaced by chlorine. In ammonia and in methane, chlorine can also replace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
the hydrogen. From ammonia is formed in this manner the so-called
chloride of nitrogen, NCl<sub>3</sub>, which decomposes very readily with violent explosion
on account of the evolved gases, and falls asunder as chlorine and
nitrogen. Out of marsh gas, or methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, may be obtained consecutively,
by this method, every possible substitution, of which chloroform,
CHCl<sub>3</sub>, is the best known, and carbon tetrachloride, CCl<sub>4</sub>, the most instructive.
But by virtue of the fact that chlorine and bromine act, in the manner
shown, on the simplest typical hydrogen compounds, their action on the
more complicated ones may be assumed to be the same. This can be easily
demonstrated. The hydrogen of benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, reacts feebly under the influence
of light on liquid bromine, but Gustavson has shown that the addition
of the smallest quantity of metallic aluminium causes energetic action and
the evolution of large volumes of hydrogen bromide.</p>

<p>If we pass on to the second typical hydrogen compound&mdash;that is to say,
water&mdash;its molecule, HOH, may be split up in two ways: either into an atom
of hydrogen and a semi-molecule of hydrogen peroxide, HO, or into oxygen,
O, and two atoms of hydrogen, H; and therefore, according to the principle
of substitution, it is evident that one atom of hydrogen can exchange
with hydrogen oxide, HO, and two atoms of hydrogen, H, with one atom of
oxygen, O.</p>

<p>Both these forms of substitution will constitute methods of oxidation&mdash;that
is to say, of the entrance of oxygen into the compound&mdash;a reaction
which is so common in nature as well as in the arts, taking place at the
expense of the oxygen of the air or by the aid of various oxidising substances
or bodies which part easily with their oxygen. There is no occasion
to reckon up the unlimited number of cases of such oxidising reactions. It
is sufficient to state that in the first of these oxygen is directly transferred,
and the position, the chemical function, which hydrogen originally occupied,
is, after the substitution, occupied by the hydroxyl. Thus ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>,
yields hydroxylamine, NH<sub>2</sub>(OH), a substance which retains many of the
properties of ammonia.</p>

<p>Methane and a number of other hydrocarbons yield, by substitution of
the hydrogen by its oxide, methyl alcohol, CH<sub>3</sub>(OH), and other alcohols. The
substitution of one atom of oxygen for two atoms of hydrogen is equally
common with hydrogen compounds. By this means alcoholic liquids containing
ethyl alcohol, or spirits of wine, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH), are oxidised until they
become vinegar, or acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O(OH). In the same way caustic
ammonia, or the combination of ammonia with water, NH<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, or NH<sub>4</sub>(OH),
which contains a great deal of hydrogen, by oxidation exchanges four atoms
of hydrogen for two atoms of oxygen, and becomes converted into nitric acid,
NO<sub>2</sub>(OH). This process of conversion of ammonium salts into saltpetre goes
on in the fields every summer, and with especial rapidity in tropical countries.
The method by which this is accomplished, though complex, though involving
the agency of all-permeating micro-organisms, is, in substance, the same as
that by which alcohol is converted into acetic acid, or glycol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, into
oxalic acid, if we view the process of oxidation in the light of the Newtonian
principles.</p>

<p>But while speaking of the application of the principle of substitution to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
water, we need not multiply instances, but must turn our attention to two
special circumstances which are closely connected with the very mechanism
of substitutions.</p>

<p>In the first place, the replacement of two atoms of hydrogen by one atom
of oxygen may take place in two ways, because the hydrogen molecule is
composed of two atoms, and therefore, under the influence of oxygen, the
molecule forming water may separate before the oxygen has time to take its
place. It is for this reason that we find, during the conversion of alcohol
into acetic acid, that there is an interval during which is formed aldehyde,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, which, as its very name implies, is &lsquo;alcohol dehydrogenatum,&rsquo; or
alcohol deprived of hydrogen. Hence aldehyde combined with hydrogen
yields alcohol; and united to oxygen, acetic acid.</p>

<p>For the same reason there should be, and there actually are, intermediate
products between ammonia and nitric acid, NO<sub>2</sub>(HO), containing either less
hydrogen than ammonia, less oxygen than nitric acid, or less water than
caustic ammonia. Accordingly we find, among the products of the deoxidation
of nitric acid and the oxidation of ammonia, not only hydroxylamine,
but also nitrous oxide, nitrous and nitric anhydrides. Thus, the production
of nitrous acid results from the removal of two atoms of hydrogen from
caustic ammonia and the substitution of the oxygen for the hydrogen,
NO(OH); or by the substitution, in ammonia, of three atoms of hydrogen by
hydroxyl, N(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and by the removal of water: N(OH)<sub>3</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O = NO(OH).
The peculiarities and properties of nitrous acid&mdash;as, for instance, its action on
ammonia and its conversion, by oxidation, into nitric acid&mdash;are thus clearly
revealed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in speaking of the principle of substitution as applied
to water, it is necessary to observe that hydrogen and hydroxyl, H and OH,
are not only competent to unite, but also to form combinations with themselves,
and thus become H<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; and such are hydrogen and the
peroxide thereof. In general, if a molecule A B exists, then molecules A A
and B B can exist also. A direct reaction of this kind does not, however,
take place in water, therefore undoubtedly, at the moment of formation,
hydrogen reacts on hydrogen peroxide, as we can show at once by
experiment; and further because hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, exhibits a
structure containing a molecule of hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>, and one of oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>,
either of which is capable of separate existence. The fact, however, may
now be taken as thoroughly established, that, at the moment of combustion
of hydrogen or of the hydrogen compounds, hydrogen peroxide is always
formed, and not only so, but in all probability its formation invariably precedes
the formation of water. This was to be expected as a consequence of
the law of Avogadro and Gerhardt, which leads us to expect this sequence
in the case of equal interactions of volumes of vapours and gases; and in
hydrogen peroxide we actually have such equal volumes of the elementary
gases.</p>

<p>The instability of hydrogen peroxide&mdash;that is to say, the ease with
which it decomposes into water and oxygen, even at the mere contact of
porous substances&mdash;accounts for the circumstance that it does not form a permanent
product of combustion, and is not produced during the decomposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
of water. I may mention this additional consideration that, with respect
to hydrogen peroxide, we may look for its effecting still further substitutions
of hydrogen by means of which we may expect to obtain still more
highly oxidised water compounds, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. These Schönbein
and Bunsen have long been seeking, and Berthelot is investigating them
at present. It is probable, however, that the reaction will stop at the
last compound, because we find that, in a number of cases, the addition of
four atoms of oxygen seems to form a limit. Thus, OsO<sub>4</sub>, KClO<sub>4</sub>, KMnO<sub>4</sub>,
K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and such like, represent the highest grades of oxidation.<a name="FNanchor_1_531" id="FNanchor_1_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_531" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>As for the last forty years, from the times of Berzelius, Dumas, Liebig,
Gerhardt, Williamson, Frankland, Kolbe, Kekulé, and Butleroff, most theoretical
generalisations have centred round organic or carbon compounds,
we will, for the sake of brevity, leave out the discussion of ammonia derivatives,
notwithstanding their simplicity with respect to the doctrine of substitutions;
we will dwell more especially on its application to carbon compounds,
starting from methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, as the simplest of the hydrocarbons, containing
in its molecule one atom of carbon. According to the principles enumerated
we may derive from CH<sub>4</sub> every combination of the form CH<sub>3</sub>X, CH<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>,
CHX<sub>3</sub>, and CX<sub>4</sub>, in which X is an element, or radicle, equivalent to hydrogen&mdash;that
is to say, competent to take its place or to combine with it. Such are
the chlorine substitutes already mentioned, such is wood-spirit, CH<sub>3</sub>(OH), in
which X is represented by the residue of water, and such are numerous other
carbon derivatives. If we continue, with the aid of hydroxyl, further substitutions
of the hydrogen of methane we shall obtain successively CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
CH(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and C(OH)<sub>4</sub>. But if, in proceeding thus, we bear in mind that
CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> contains two hydroxyls in the same form as hydrogen peroxide,
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or (OH)<sub>2</sub>, contains them&mdash;and moreover not only in one molecule, but
together, attached to one and the same atom of carbon&mdash;so here we must
look for the same decomposition as that which we find in hydrogen peroxide,
and accompanied also by the formation of water as an independently
existing molecule; therefore CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> should yield, as it actually does, immediately
water and the oxide of methylene, CH<sub>2</sub>O, which is methane with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
oxygen substituted for two atoms of hydrogen. Exactly in the same manner
out of CH(OH)<sub>3</sub> are formed water and formic acid, CHO(OH), and out of
C(OH)<sub>4</sub> is produced water and carbonic acid, or directly carbonic anhydride,
CO<sub>2</sub>, which will therefore be nothing else than methane with the double replacement
of pairs of hydrogen by oxygen. As nothing leads to the supposition
that the four atoms of hydrogen in methane differ one from the other,
so it does not matter by what means we obtain any one of the combinations
indicated&mdash;they will be identical; that is to say, there will be no case of
actual isomerism, although there may easily be such cases of isomerism as
have been distinguished by the term metamerism.</p>

<p>Formic acid, for example, has two atoms of hydrogen, one attached to the
carbon left from the methane, and the other attached to the oxygen which
has entered in the form of hydroxyl, and if one of them be replaced by some
substance X it is evident that we shall obtain substances of the same composition,
but of different construction, or of different orders of movement among
the molecules, and therefore endowed with other properties and reactions. If
X be methyl, CH<sub>4</sub>&mdash;that is to say, a group capable of replacing hydrogen
because it is actually contained with hydrogen in methane itself&mdash;then by
substituting this group for the original hydrogen we obtain acetic acid,
CCH<sub>3</sub>O(OH), out of formic, and by substitution of the hydrogen in its oxide or
hydroxyl we obtain methyl formate, CHO(OCH<sub>3</sub>). These substances differ so
much from each other physically and chemically that at first sight it is hardly
possible to admit that they contain the same atoms in identically the same
proportions. Acetic acid, for example, boils at a higher temperature than
water, and has a higher specific gravity than it, whilst its metameride,
methyl formate, is lighter than water, and boils at 30°&mdash;that is to say, it
evaporates very easily.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to carbon compounds containing two atoms of carbon to
the molecule, as in acetic acid, and proceed to evolve them from methane by
the principle of substitution. This principle declares at once that methane
can only be split up in the four following ways:&mdash;</p>

<p>1.  Into a group CH<sub>3</sub> equivalent with H. Let us call changes of this
nature methylation.</p>

<p>2. Into a group CH<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. We will call this order of substitutions
methylenation.</p>

<p>3. Into CH and H<sub>3</sub>, which commutations we will call acetylenation.</p>

<p>4. Into C and H<sub>4</sub>, which may be called carbonation.</p>

<p>It is evident that hydrocarbon compounds containing two atoms of carbon
can only proceed from methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, which contains four atoms of hydrogen
by the first three methods of substitution; carbonation would yield free carbon
if it could take place directly, and if the molecule of free carbon&mdash;which is in
reality very complex, that is to say strongly polyatomic, as I have long since
been proving by various means&mdash;could contain only C<sub>2</sub> like the molecules
O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, and so on.</p>

<p>By methylation we should evidently obtain from marsh gas, ethane,
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>By methylenation&mdash;that is, by substituting group CH<sub>2</sub> for H<sub>2</sub>&mdash;methane
forms ethylene, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>By acetylenation&mdash;that is, by substituting three atoms of hydrogen, H<sub>3</sub>, in
methane&mdash;by the remnant CH, we get acetylene, CHCH = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>If we have applied the principles of Newton correctly, there should not be
any other hydrocarbons containing two atoms of carbon in the molecule.
All these combinations have long been known, and in each of them we can
not only produce those substitutions of which an example has been given in
the case of methane, but also all the phases of other substitutions, as we shall
find from a few more instances, by the aid of which I trust that I shall be
able to show the great complexity of those derivatives which, on the principle
of substitution, can be obtained from each hydrocarbon. Let us content ourselves
with the case of ethane, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, and the substitution of the hydrogen
by hydroxyl. The following are the possible changes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>(OH): this is nothing more than spirit of wine, or ethyl
alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH) or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O.</p>

<p>2. CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>(OH): this is the glycol of Würtz, which has shed so
much light on the history of alcohol. Its isomeride may be CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
but as we have seen in the case of CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>, it decomposes, giving off water,
and forming aldehyde, CH<sub>3</sub>CHO, a substance capable of yielding alcohol by
uniting with hydrogen, and of yielding acetic acid by uniting with oxygen.</p>

<p>If glycol, CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)CH<sub>2</sub>(OH), loses its water, it may be seen at once that
it will not now yield aldehyde, CH<sub>3</sub>CHO, but its isomeride, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>/O, the
oxide of ethylene. I have here indicated in a special manner the oxygen
which has taken the place of two atoms of the hydrogen of ethane taken
from different atoms of the carbon.</p>

<p>3. CH<sub>3</sub>C(OH)<sub>3</sub> decomposed as CH(OH)<sub>3</sub>, forming water and acetic acid,
CH<sub>3</sub>CO(OH). It is evident that this acid is nothing else than formic acid,
CHO(OH), with its hydrogen replaced by methyl. Without examining
further the vast number of possible derivatives, I will direct your attention
to the circumstance that in dissolving acetic acid in water we obtain the
maximum contraction and the greatest viscosity when to the molecule
CH<sub>3</sub>CO(OH) is added a molecule of water, which is the proportion which
would form the hydrate CH<sub>3</sub>C(OH)<sub>3</sub>. It is probable that the doubling of
the molecule of acetic acid at temperatures approaching its boiling-point
has some connection with this power of uniting with one molecule of
water.</p>

<p>4. CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)C(OH)<sub>3</sub> is evidently an alcoholic acid, and indeed this compound,
after losing water, answers to glycolic acid, CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)CO(OH).
Without investigating all the possible isomerides, we will note only that the
hydrate CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>CH(OH)<sub>2</sub> has the same composition as CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)C(OH)<sub>3</sub>,
and although corresponding to glycol, and being a symmetrical substance, it
becomes, on parting with its water, the aldehyde of oxalic acid, or the glyoxal
of Debus, CHOCHO.</p>

<p>5. CH(OH)<sub>2</sub>C(OH<sub>3</sub>), from the tendency of all the preceding, corresponds
with glyoxylic acid, an aldehyde acid, CHOCO(OH), because the group
CO(OH), or carboxyl, enters into the compositions of organic acids, and the
group CHO defines the aldehyde function.</p>

<p>6. C(OH)<sub>3</sub>C(OH)<sub>3</sub> through the loss of 2H<sub>2</sub>O yields the bibasic oxalic acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
CO(OH)CO(OH), which generally crystallises with 2H<sub>2</sub>O, following thus the
normal type of hydration characteristic of ethane.<a name="FNanchor_2_532" id="FNanchor_2_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_532" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Thus, by applying the principle of substitution, we can, in the simplest
manner, derive not only every kind of hydrocarbon compound, such as the
alcohols, the aldehyde-alcohols, aldehydes, alcohol-acids, and the acids, but
also combinations analogous to hydrated crystals which usually are disregarded.</p>

<p>But even those unsaturated substances, of which ethylene, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>, and
acetylene, CHCH, are types, may be evolved with equal simplicity. With
respect to the phenomena of isomerism, there are many possibilities among
the hydrocarbon compounds containing two atoms of carbon, and without
going into details it will be sufficient to indicate that the following formulæ,
though not identical, will be isomeric substantially among themselves:&mdash;CH<sub>3</sub>CHX<sub>2</sub>
and CH<sub>2</sub>XCH<sub>2</sub>X, although both contain C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>X<sub>2</sub>; or CH<sub>2</sub>CX<sub>2</sub> and
CHXCHX, although both contain C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>, if by X we indicate chlorine or
generally an element capable of replacing one atom of hydrogen, or capable
of uniting with it. To isomerism of this kind belongs the case of aldehyde
and the oxide of ethylene, to which we have already referred, because both
have the composition C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O.</p>

<p>What I have said appears to me sufficient to show that the principle of
substitution adequately explains the composition, the isomerism, and all the
diversity of combination of the hydrocarbons, and I shall limit the further
development of these views to preparing a complete list of every possible
hydrocarbon compound containing three atoms of carbon in the molecule.
There are eight in all, of which only five are known at present.<a name="FNanchor_3_533" id="FNanchor_3_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_533" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Among those possible for C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub> there should be two isomerides, propylene
and trimethylene, and they are both already known. For C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>4</sub> there should
be three isomerides: allylene and allene are known, but the third has not
yet been discovered; and for C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub> there should be two isomerides, though
neither of them is known as yet. Their composition and structure are easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
deduced from ethane, ethylene, and acetylene, by methylation, by methylenation,
by acetylenation and by carbonation.</p>

<p>1. C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> = CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> out of CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> by methylation. This hydrocarbon
is named propane.</p>

out of CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> by carbonation, or out of CHCH by
methylenation. This compound is unknown.</p>

<p>If we bear in mind that for each hydrocarbon serving as a type in the
above tables there are a number of corresponding derivatives, and that every
compound obtained may, by further methylation, methylenation, acetylenation,
and carbonation, produce new hydrocarbons, and these may be followed
by a numerous suite of derivatives and an immense number of isomeric
substances, it is possible to understand the limitless number of carbon compounds,
although they all have the one substance, methane, for their origin.
The number of substances is so enormous that it is no longer a question of
enlarging the possibilities of discovery, but rather of finding some means of
testing them analogous to the well-known two which for a long time have
served as gauges for all carbon compounds.</p>

<p>I refer to the law of even numbers and to that of limits, the first enunciated
by Gerhardt some forty years ago, with respect to hydrocarbons, namely,
that their molecules always contain an even number of atoms of hydrogen.
But by the method which I have used of deriving all the hydrocarbons from
methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, this law may be deduced as a direct consequence of the
principle of substitutions. Accordingly, in methylation, CH<sub>3</sub> takes the place
of H, and therefore CH<sub>2</sub> is added. In methylenation the number of atoms of
hydrogen remains unchanged, and at each acetylenation it is reduced by two,
and in carbonation by four, atoms&mdash;that is to say, an even number of atoms
of hydrogen is always added or removed. And because the fundamental
hydrocarbon, methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, contains an even number of atoms of hydrogen,
all its derivative hydrocarbons will also contain even numbers of hydrogen,
and this constitutes the law of even numbers.</p>

<p>The principle of substitutions explains with equal simplicity the conception
of the limiting compositions of hydrocarbons C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>, which I derived, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
1861,<a name="FNanchor_4_534" id="FNanchor_4_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_534" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> in an empirical manner from accumulated materials available at that
time, and on the basis of the limits to combinations worked out by Dr. Frankland
for other elements.</p>

<p>Of all the various substitutions the highest proportion of hydrogen is
yielded by methylation, because in that operation alone does the quantity of
hydrogen increase; hence, taking methane as a point of departure, if we
imagine methylation effected (<i>n</i> - 1) times we obtain hydrocarbon compounds
containing the highest quantities of hydrogen. It is evident that they will
contain CH<sub>4</sub> + (<i>n</i> - 1)CH<sub>2</sub>, or C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>, because methylation leads to the addition
of CH<sub>2</sub> to the compound.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that by the principle of substitution&mdash;that is to say,
by the third law of Newton&mdash;we are able to deduce, in the simplest manner,
not only the individual composition, the isomerism, and relations of substances,
but also the general laws which govern their most complex combinations
without having recourse either to statical constructions, to the definition
of atomicities, to the exclusion of free affinities, or to the recognition of those
single, double or treble bonds which are so indispensable to structuralists in the
explanation of the composition and construction of hydrocarbon compounds.
And yet, by the application of the dynamical principles of Newton, we can
attain to that chief and fundamental object, the comprehension of isomerism
in hydrocarbon compounds, and the forecasting of the existence of combinations
as yet unknown, by which the edifice raised by structural teaching is
strengthened and supported. Besides&mdash;and I count this for a circumstance
of special importance&mdash;the process which I advocate will make no difference
in those special cases which have been already so well worked out, such as,
for example, the isomerism of the hydrocarbons and alcohols, even to the
extent of not interfering with the nomenclature which has been adopted, and
the structural system will retain all the glory of having worked up, in a
thoroughly scientific manner, the store of information which Gerhardt had
accumulated about the middle of the fifties, and the still higher glory of
establishing the rational synthesis of organic substances. Nothing will be
lost to the structural doctrine except its statical origin; and as soon as it
will embrace the dynamic principles of Newton, and suffer itself to be guided
by them, I believe that we shall attain for chemistry that unity of principle
which is now wanting. Many an adept will be attracted to that brilliant and
fascinating enterprise, the penetration into the unseen world of the kinetic
relations of atoms, to the study of which the last twenty-five years have contributed
so much labour and such high inventive faculties.</p>

<p>D'Alembert found in mechanics that if inertia be taken to represent force,
dynamic equations may be applied to statical questions, which are thereby
rendered more simple and more easily understood.</p>

<p>The structural doctrine in chemistry has unconsciously followed the same
course, and therefore its terms are easily adopted; they may retain their
present forms provided that a truly dynamical&mdash;that is to say, Newtonian&mdash;meaning
be ascribed to them.</p>

<p>Before finishing my task and demonstrating the possibility of adapting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
structural doctrines to the dynamics of Newton, I consider it indispensable
to touch on one question which naturally arises, and which I have heard
discussed more than once. If bromine, the atom of which is eighty times
heavier than that of hydrogen, takes the place of hydrogen, it would seem
that the whole system of dynamic equilibrium must be destroyed.</p>

<p>Without entering into the minute analysis of this question, I think it
will be sufficient to examine it by the light of two well-known phenomena,
one of which will be found in the department of chemistry and the other in
that of celestial mechanics, and both will serve to demonstrate the existence
of that unity in the plan of creation which is a consequence of the Newtonian
doctrines. Experiments demonstrate that when a heavy element is substituted
for a light one in a chemical compound&mdash;for example, for magnesium,
in the oxide of that metal, an atom of mercury, which is 8&#8531; times heavier&mdash;the
chief chemical characteristics or properties are generally, though not
always, preserved.</p>

<p>The substitution of silver for hydrogen, than which it is 108 times heavier,
does not affect all the properties of the substance, though it does some.
Therefore chemical substitutions of this kind&mdash;the substitution of light for
heavy atoms&mdash;need not necessarily entail changes in the original equilibrium;
and this point is still further elucidated by the consideration that the periodic
law indicates the degree of influence of an increment of weight in the atom
as affecting the possible equilibria, and also what degree of increase in the
weight of the atoms reproduces some, though not all, of the properties of the
substance.</p>

<p>This tendency to repetition&mdash;these periods&mdash;may be likened to those
annual or diurnal periods with which we are so familiar on the earth. Days
and years follow each other, but, as they do so, many things change; and in
like manner chemical evolutions, changes in the masses of the elements,
permit of much remaining undisturbed, though many properties undergo
alteration. The system is maintained according to the laws of conservation
in nature, but the motions are altered in consequence of the change of parts.</p>

<p>Next, let us take an astronomical case&mdash;such, for example, as the earth and
the moon&mdash;and let us imagine that the mass of the latter is constantly
increasing. The question is, what will then occur? The path of the moon
in space is a wave-line similar to that which geometricians have named epicycloidal,
or the locus of a point in a circle rolling round another circle. But
in consequence of the influence of the moon it is evident that the path of the
earth itself cannot be a geometric ellipse, even supposing the sun to be immovably
fixed; it must be an epicycloidal curve, though not very far removed
from the true ellipse&mdash;that is to say, it will be impressed with but faint undulations.
It is only the common centre of gravity of the earth and the
moon which describes a true ellipse round the sun. If the moon were to
increase, the relative undulations of the earth's path would increase in amplitude,
those of the moon would also change, and when the mass of the moon
had increased to an equality with that of the earth, the path would consist of
epicycloidal curves crossing each other, and having opposite phases. But a
similar relation exists between the sun and the earth, because the former is
also moving in space. We may apply these views to the world of atoms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
suppose that in their movements, when heavy ones take the place of those
that are lighter, similar changes take place, provided that the system or the
molecule is preserved throughout the change.</p>

<p>It seems probable that in the heavenly systems, during incalculable
astronomical periods, changes have taken place and are still going on similar
to those which pass rapidly before our eyes during the chemical reaction of
molecules, and the progress of molecular mechanics may&mdash;we hope will&mdash;in
course of time permit us to explain those changes in the stellar world which
have more than once been noticed by astronomers, and which are now so
carefully studied. A coming Newton will discover the laws of these changes.
Those laws, when applied to chemistry, may exhibit peculiarities, but these
will certainly be mere variations on the grand harmonious theme which
reigns in nature. The discovery of the laws which produce this harmony in
chemical evolution will only be possible, it seems to me, under the banner
of Newtonian dynamics, which has so long waved over the domains of
mechanics, astronomy, and physics. In calling chemists to take their stand
under its peaceful and catholic shadow I imagine that I am aiding in establishing
that scientific union which the managers of the Royal Institution
wish to effect, who have shown their desire to do so by the flattering invitation
which has given me&mdash;a Russian&mdash;the opportunity of laying before the
countrymen of Newton an attempt to apply to chemistry one of his immortal
principles.</p>

there lies a deep interest and meaning with regard to chemical mechanics. But because,
to my imagination, the idea of unity of design in Nature, either acting in complex
celestial systems or among chemical molecules, is very attractive, especially because the
atomic teaching at once acquires its true meaning, I will recall the following facts relating
to the solar system. There are eight major planets, of which the four inner ones
are not only separated from the four outer by asteroids, but differ from them in many
respects, as, for example, in the smallness of their diameters and their greater density.
Saturn with his ring has eight satellites, Jupiter and Uranus have each four. It is evident
that in the solar systems also we meet with these higher numbers four and eight
which appear in the combination of chemical molecules.</p></div>

are impossible, because it would correspond with the hydrocarbon CHCH<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, which
is isomeric with ethylene, and it cannot be derived from methane. If such an isomeride
existed it would be derived from CH<sub>2</sub>, but such products are, up to the present, unknown.
In such cases the insufficiency of the points of departure of the statical structural teaching
is shown. It first admits constant atomicity and then rejects it, the facts serving to
establish either one or the other view; and therefore it seems to me that we must come
to the conclusion that the structural method of reasoning, having done a service to
science, has outlived the age, and must be regenerated, as in their time was the teaching
of the electro-chemists, the radicalists, and the adherents of the doctrine of types. As
we cannot now lean on the views above stated, it is time to abandon the structural
theory. They will all be united in chemical mechanics, and the principle of substitution
must be looked on only as a preparation for the coming epoch in chemistry, where
such cases as the isomerism of fumaric and maleic acids, when explained dynamically, as
proposed by Le Bel and Van't Hoff, may yield points of departure.</p></div>

<p class="title"><span style="font-size: 125%;">THE PERIODIC LAW OF THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS</span></p>

<p class="title"><span style="font-size: 110%;"><span class="smcap">By</span> PROFESSOR MENDELÉEFF</span></p>

<p class="title">FARADAY LECTURE DELIVERED BEFORE THE FELLOWS OF
THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY IN THE THEATRE OF THE ROYAL INSTITUTION, ON TUESDAY, JUNE 4, 1889</p>

<p>The high honour bestowed by the Chemical Society in inviting me to pay a
tribute to the world-famed name of Faraday by delivering this lecture has
induced me to take for its subject the Periodic Law of the Elements&mdash;this
being a generalisation in chemistry which has of late attracted much
attention.</p>

<p>While science is pursuing a steady onward movement, it is convenient
from time to time to cast a glance back on the route already traversed, and
especially to consider the new conceptions which aim at discovering the
general meaning of the stock of facts accumulated from day to day in our
laboratories. Owing to the possession of laboratories, modern science now
bears a new character, quite unknown, not only to antiquity, but even to the
preceding century. Bacon's and Descartes' idea of submitting the mechanism
of science simultaneously to experiment and reasoning has been fully realised
in the case of chemistry, it having become not only possible but always
customary to experiment. Under the all-penetrating control of experiment,
a new theory, even if crude, is quickly strengthened, provided it be founded
on a sufficient basis; the asperities are removed, it is amended by degrees,
and soon loses the phantom light of a shadowy form or of one founded on
mere prejudice; it is able to lead to logical conclusions, and to submit to experimental
proof. Willingly or not, in science we all must submit not to what
seems to us attractive from one point of view or from another, but to what
represents an agreement between theory and experiment; in other words, to
demonstrated generalisation and to the approved experiment. Is it long
since many refused to accept the generalisations involved in the law of Avogadro
and Ampère, so widely extended by Gerhardt? We still may hear the
voices of its opponents; they enjoy perfect freedom, but vainly will their
voices rise so long as they do not use the language of demonstrated facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
The striking observations with the spectroscope which have permitted us to
analyse the chemical constitution of distant worlds, seemed, at first, applicable
to the task of determining the nature of the atoms themselves; but the
working out of the idea in the laboratory soon demonstrated that the characters
of spectra are determined, not directly by the atoms, but by the molecules
into which the atoms are packed; and so it became evident that more
verified facts must be collected before it will be possible to formulate new
generalisations capable of taking their place beside those ordinary ones based
upon the conception of simple substances and atoms. But as the shade of the
leaves and roots of living plants, together with the relics of a decayed vegetation,
favour the growth of the seedling and serve to promote its luxurious
development, in like manner sound generalisations&mdash;together with the relics
of those which have proved to be untenable&mdash;promote scientific productivity,
and ensure the luxurious growth of science under the influence of rays emanating
from the centres of scientific energy. Such centres are scientific
associations and societies. Before one of the oldest and most powerful of
these I am about to take the liberty of passing in review the twenty years' life
of a generalisation which is known under the name of the Periodic Law. It
was in March 1869 that I ventured to lay before the then youthful Russian
Chemical Society the ideas upon the same subject which I had expressed in
my just written &lsquo;Principles of Chemistry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Without entering into details, I will give the conclusions I then arrived
at in the very words I used:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;1. The elements, if arranged according to their atomic weights, exhibit
an evident <i>periodicity</i> of properties.</p>

<p>&lsquo;2. Elements which are similar as regards their chemical properties have
atomic weights which are either of nearly the same value (<i>e.g.</i> platinum,
iridium, osmium) or which increase regularly (<i>e.g.</i> potassium, rubidium,
cæsium).</p>

<p>&lsquo;3. The arrangement of the elements, or of groups of elements, in the
order of their atomic weights, corresponds to their so-called <i>valencies</i> as well
as, to some extent, to their distinctive chemical properties&mdash;as is apparent,
among other series, in that of lithium, beryllium, barium, carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, and iron.</p>

<p>&lsquo;4. The elements which are the most widely diffused have <i>small</i> atomic
weights.</p>

<p>&lsquo;5. The <i>magnitude</i> of the atomic weight determines the character of the
element, just as the magnitude of the molecule determines the character of
a compound.</p>

<p>&lsquo;6. We must expect the discovery of many yet <i>unknown</i> elements&mdash;for
example, elements analogous to aluminium and silicon, whose atomic weight
would be between 65 and 75.</p>

<p>&lsquo;7. The atomic weight of an element may sometimes be amended by a
knowledge of those of the contiguous elements. Thus, the atomic weight of
tellurium must lie between 123 and 126, and cannot be 128.</p>

<p>&lsquo;8. Certain characteristic properties of the elements can be foretold from
their atomic weights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>&lsquo;The aim of this communication will be fully attained if I succeed in
drawing the attention of investigators to those relations which exist between
the atomic weights of dissimilar elements, which, so far as I know, have
hitherto been almost completely neglected. I believe that the solution of
some of the most important problems of our science lies in researches of this
kind.&rsquo;</p>

<p>To-day, twenty years after the above conclusions were formulated, they
may still be considered as expressing the essence of the now well-known
periodic law.</p>

<p>Reverting to the epoch terminating with the sixties, it is proper to indicate
three series of data without the knowledge of which the periodic law
could not have been discovered, and which rendered its appearance natural
and intelligible.</p>

<p>In the first place, it was at that time that the numerical value of atomic
weights became definitely known. Ten years earlier such knowledge did not
exist, as may be gathered from the fact that in 1860 chemists from all parts
of the world met at Karlsruhe in order to come to some agreement, if not
with respect to views relating to atoms, at any rate as regards their definite
representation. Many of those present probably remember how vain were
the hopes of coming to an understanding, and how much ground was gained
at that Congress by the followers of the unitary theory so brilliantly represented
by Cannizzaro. I vividly remember the impression produced by his
speeches, which admitted of no compromise, and seemed to advocate truth
itself, based on the conceptions of Avogadro, Gerhardt, and Regnault, which
at that time were far from being generally recognised. And though no
understanding could be arrived at, yet the objects of the meeting were attained,
for the ideas of Cannizzaro proved, after a few years, to be the only ones
which could stand criticism, and which represented an atom as&mdash;&lsquo;the
smallest portion of an element which enters into a molecule of its compound.&rsquo;
Only such real atomic weights&mdash;not conventional ones&mdash;could afford a basis
for generalisation. It is sufficient, by way of example, to indicate the
following cases in which the relation is seen at once and is perfectly clear:&mdash;</p>

<table cellpadding="3" summary="p473_1">

    <td class="tdl">Ba = 68·5</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">the consecutiveness of change in atomic weight, which with the true values
is so evident, completely disappears.</p>

<p>Secondly, it had become evident during the period 1860&ndash;70, and even
during the preceding decade, that the relations between the atomic weights
of analogous elements were governed by some general and simple laws.
Cooke, Cremers, Gladstone, Gmelin, Lenssen, Pettenkofer, and especially
Dumas, had already established many facts bearing on that view. Thus
Dumas compared the following groups of analogous elements with organic
radicles:&mdash;</p>

<p>A. Strecker, in his work &lsquo;Theorien und Experimente zur Bestimmung
der Atomgewichte der Elemente&rsquo; (Braunschweig, 1859), after summarising
the data relating to the subject, and pointing out the remarkable series of
equivalents&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">Cr = 26·2 Mn = 27·6 Fe = 28 Ni = 29 Co = 30 Cu = 31·7 Zn = 32·5</p>

<p class="noindent">remarks that: &lsquo;It is hardly probable that all the above-mentioned relations
between the atomic weights (or equivalents) of chemically analogous elements
are merely accidental. We must, however, leave to the future the discovery
of the <i>law</i> of the relations which appears in these figures.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_535" id="FNanchor_1_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_535" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In such attempts at arrangement and in such views are to be recognised
the real forerunners of the periodic law; the ground was prepared for it
between 1860 and 1870, and that it was not expressed in a determinate form
before the end of the decade may, I suppose, be ascribed to the fact that only
analogous elements had been compared. The idea of seeking for a relation
between the atomic weights of all the elements was foreign to the ideas then
current, so that neither the <i>vis tellurique</i> of De Chancourtois, nor the <i>law of
octaves</i> of Newlands, could secure anybody's attention. And yet both De
Chancourtois and Newlands like Dumas and Strecker, more than Lenssen
and Pettenkofer, had made an approach to the periodic law and had discovered
its germs. The solution of the problem advanced but slowly, because
the facts, but not the law, stood foremost in all attempts; and the law could
not awaken a general interest so long as elements, having no apparent connection
with each other, were included in the same octave, as for example:&mdash;</p>

<p>Analogies of the above order seemed quite accidental, and the more so as
the octave contained occasionally ten elements instead of eight, and when two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
such elements as Ba and V, Co and Ni, or Rh and Ru, occupied one place in
the octave.<a name="FNanchor_2_536" id="FNanchor_2_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_536" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Nevertheless, the fruit was ripening, and I now see clearly that
Strecker, De Chancourtois, and Newlands stood foremost in the way towards
the discovery of the periodic law, and that they merely wanted the boldness
necessary to place the whole question at such a height that its reflection on
the facts could be clearly seen.</p>

<p>A third circumstance which revealed the periodicity of chemical elements
was the accumulation, by the end of the sixties, of new information respecting
the rare elements, disclosing their many-sided relations to the other elements
and to each other. The researches of Marignac on niobium, and those of
Roscoe on vanadium, were of special moment. The striking analogies between
vanadium and phosphorus on the one hand, and between vanadium and
chromium on the other, which became so apparent in the investigations connected
with that element, naturally induced the comparison of V = 51 with
Cr = 52, Nb = 94 with Mo = 96, and Ta = 192 with W = 194; while, on the
other hand, P = 31 could be compared with S = 32, As = 75 with Se = 79, and
Sb = 120 with Te = 125. From such approximations there remained but one
step to the discovery of the law of periodicity.</p>

<p>The law of periodicity was thus a direct outcome of the stock of generalisations
and established facts which had accumulated by the end of the decade
1860&ndash;1870; it is an embodiment of those data in a more or less systematic
expression. Where, then, lies the secret of the special importance which has
since been attached to the periodic law, and has raised it to the position of a
generalisation which has already given to chemistry unexpected aid, and
which promises to be far more fruitful in the future and to impress upon
several branches of chemical research a peculiar and original stamp? The
remaining part of my communication will be an attempt to answer this
question.</p>

<p>In the first place we have the circumstance that, as soon as the law made
its appearance, it demanded a revision of many facts which were considered
by chemists as fully established by existing experience. I shall return, later
on, briefly to this subject, but I wish now to remind you that the periodic
law, by insisting on the necessity for a revision of supposed facts, exposed
itself at once to destruction in its very origin. Its first requirements, however,
have been almost entirely satisfied during the last 20 years; the supposed
facts have yielded to the law, thus proving that the law itself was a
legitimate induction from the verified facts. But our inductions from data
have often to do with such details of a science so rich in facts, that only
generalisations which cover a wide range of important phenomena can attract
general attention. What were the regions touched on by the periodic law?
This is what we shall now consider.</p>

<p>The most important point to notice is, that periodic functions, used for
the purpose of expressing changes which are dependent on variations of time
and space, have been long known. They are familiar to the mind when we
have to deal with motion in closed cycles, or with any kind of deviation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
a stable position, such as occurs in pendulum-oscillations. A like periodic
function became evident in the case of the elements, depending on the mass
of the atom. The primary conception of the masses of bodies, or of the masses
of atoms, belongs to a category which the present state of science forbids us
to discuss, because as yet we have no means of dissecting or analysing the
conception. All that was known of functions dependent on masses derived
its origin from Galileo and Newton, and indicated that such functions
either decrease or increase with the increase of mass, like the attraction of
celestial bodies. The numerical expression of the phenomena was always
found to be proportional to the mass, and in no case was an increase of mass
followed by a recurrence of properties such as is disclosed by the periodic law
of the elements. This constituted such a novelty in the study of the phenomena
of nature that, although it did not lift the veil which conceals the true conception
of mass, it nevertheless indicated that the explanation of that conception
must be searched for in the masses of the atoms; the more so, as all masses
are nothing but aggregations, or additions, of chemical atoms which would be
best described as chemical individuals. Let me remark, by the way, that
though the Latin word &lsquo;individual&rsquo; is merely a translation of the Greek word
&lsquo;atom,&rsquo; nevertheless history and custom have drawn a sharp distinction
between the two words, and the present chemical conception of atoms is
nearer to that defined by the Latin word than by the Greek, although this
latter also has acquired a special meaning which was unknown to the classics.
The periodic law has shown that our chemical individuals display a harmonic
periodicity of properties dependent on their masses. Now natural science
has long been accustomed to deal with periodicities observed in nature, to
seize them with the vice of mathematical analysis, to submit them to the
rasp of experiment. And these instruments of scientific thought would
surely, long since, have mastered the problem connected with the chemical
elements, were it not for a new feature which was brought to light by the
periodic law, and which gave a peculiar and original character to the periodic
function.</p>

<p>If we mark on an axis of abscissæ a series of lengths proportional to
angles, and trace ordinates which are proportional to sines or other trigonometrical
functions, we get periodic curves of a harmonic character. So it
might seem, at first sight, that with the increase of atomic weights the function
of the properties of the elements should also vary in the same harmonious
way. But in this case there is no such continuous change as in the curves
just referred to, because the periods do not contain the infinite number of
points constituting a curve, but a <i>finite</i> number only of such points. An
example will better illustrate this view. The atomic weights&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">Ag = 108&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Cd = 112&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In = 113&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sn = 118&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sb = 120
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Te = 125&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I = 127</p>

<p class="noindent">steadily increase, and their increase is accompanied by a modification of
many properties which constitutes the essence of the periodic law. Thus,
for example, the densities of the above elements decrease steadily, being
respectively&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">10·5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8·6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7·4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7·2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6·7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6·4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4·9</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">while their oxides contain an increasing quantity of oxygen&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">Ag<sub>2</sub>O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Te<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub></p>

<p>But to connect by a curve the summits of the ordinates expressing any
of these properties would involve the rejection of Dalton's law of multiple
proportions. Not only are there no intermediate elements between silver,
which gives AgCl, and cadmium, which gives CdCl<sub>2</sub>, but, according to the
very essence of the periodic law, there can be none; in fact a uniform curve
would be inapplicable in such a case, as it would lead us to expect elements
possessed of special properties at any point of the curve. The periods of the
elements have thus a character very different from those which are so simply
represented by geometers. They correspond to points, to numbers, to sudden
changes of the masses, and not to a continuous evolution. In these sudden
changes destitute of intermediate steps or positions, in the absence of
elements intermediate between, say, silver and cadmium, or aluminium
and silicon, we must recognise a problem to which no direct application
of the analysis of the infinitely small can be made. Therefore, neither the
trigonometrical functions proposed by Ridberg and Flavitzky, nor the pendulum-oscillations
suggested by Crookes, nor the cubical curves of the Rev.
Mr. Haughton, which have been proposed for expressing the periodic law,
from the nature of the case, can represent the periods of the chemical
elements. If geometrical analysis is to be applied to this subject, it will require
to be modified in a special manner. It must find the means of representing
in a special way, not only such long periods as that comprising</p>

<p class="title">K&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sc&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ti&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Co&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ni&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cu&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zn&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ga&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ge&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Se&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Br,</p>

<p class="noindent">but short periods like the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">Na&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Si&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cl.</p>

<p>In the theory of numbers only do we find problems analogous to ours,
and two attempts at expressing the atomic weights of the elements by algebraic
formulæ seem to be deserving of attention, although neither of them
can be considered as a complete theory, nor as promising finally to solve the
problem of the periodic law. The attempt of E. J. Mills (1886) does not
even aspire to attain this end. He considers that all atomic weights can be
expressed by a logarithmic function,</p>

<p class="title">15(<i>n</i> - 0·9375<sup><i>t</i></sup>),</p>

<p class="noindent">in which the variables <i>n</i> and <i>t</i> are <i>whole numbers</i>. Thus, for oxygen, <i>n</i> = 2,
and <i>t</i> = 1, whence its atomic weight is = 15·94; in the case of chlorine,
bromine, and iodine, <i>n</i> has respective values of 3, 6, and 9, whilst <i>t</i> = 7, 6,
and 9; in the case of potassium, rubidium, and cæsium, <i>n</i> = 4, 6, and 9, and
<i>t</i> = 14, 18, and 20.</p>

<p>Another attempt was made in 1888 by B. N. Tchitchérin. Its author
places the problem of the periodic law in the first rank, but as yet he has
investigated the alkali metals only. Tchitchérin first noticed the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
relations existing between the atomic volumes of all alkali metals; they
can be expressed, according to his views, by the formula</p>

<p class="title">A(2 - 0·00535A<i>n</i>),</p>

<p class="noindent">where A is the atomic weight, and <i>n</i> is equal to 8 for lithium and sodium, to
4 for potassium, to 3 for rubidium, and to 2 for cæsium. If <i>n</i> remained equal
to 8 during the increase of A, the volume would become zero at A = 46&#8532;,
and it would reach its maximum at A = 23&#8531;. The close approximation of
the number 46&#8532; to the differences between the atomic weights of analogous
elements (such as Cs - Rb, I - Br, and so on); the close correspondence of
the number 23&#8531; to the atomic weight of sodium; the fact of <i>n</i> being necessarily
a whole number, and several other aspects of the question, induce
Tchitchérin to believe that they afford a clue to the understanding of the
nature of the elements; we must, however, await the full development of
his theory before pronouncing judgment on it. What we can at present only
be certain of is this: that attempts like the two above named must be repeated
and multiplied, because the periodic law has clearly shown that the
masses of the atoms increase abruptly, by steps, which are clearly connected
in some way with Dalton's law of multiple proportions; and because the
periodicity of the elements finds expression in the transition from RX to
RX<sub>2</sub>, RX<sub>3</sub>, RX<sub>4</sub>, and so on till RX<sub>8</sub>, at which point, the energy of the combining
forces being exhausted, the series begins anew from RX to RX<sub>2</sub>, and
so on.</p>

<p>While connecting by new bonds the theory of the chemical elements with
Dalton's theory of multiple proportions, or atomic structure of bodies, the
periodic law opened for natural philosophy a new and wide field for speculation.
Kant said that there are in the world &lsquo;two things which never cease
to call for the admiration and reverence of man: the moral law within
ourselves, and the stellar sky above us.&rsquo; But when we turn our thoughts
towards the nature of the elements and the periodic law, we must add a third
subject, namely, &lsquo;the nature of the elementary individuals which we discover
everywhere around us.&rsquo; Without them the stellar sky itself is inconceivable;
and in the atoms we see at once their peculiar individualities, the infinite
multiplicity of the individuals, and the submission of their seeming
freedom to the general harmony of Nature.</p>

<p>Having thus indicated a new mystery of Nature, which does not yet yield
to rational conception, the periodic law, together with the revelations of
spectrum analysis, have contributed to again revive an old but remarkably
long-lived hope&mdash;that of discovering, if not by experiment, at least by a
mental effort, the <i>primary matter</i>&mdash;which had its genesis in the minds of
the Grecian philosophers, and has been transmitted, together with many
other ideas of the classic period, to the heirs of their civilisation. Having
grown, during the times of the alchemists up to the period when experimental
proof was required, the idea has rendered good service; it induced those
careful observations and experiments which later on called into being the
works of Scheele, Lavoisier, Priestley, and Cavendish. It then slumbered
awhile, but was soon awakened by the attempts either to confirm or to refute
the ideas of Prout as to the multiple proportion relationship of the atomic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
weights of all the elements. And once again the inductive or experimental
method of studying Nature gained a direct advantage from the old Pythagorean
idea: because atomic weights were determined with an accuracy
formerly unknown. But again the idea could not stand the ordeal of experimental
test, yet the prejudice remains and has not been uprooted, even by
Stas; nay, it has gained a new vigour, for we see that all which is imperfectly
worked out, new and unexplained, from the still scarcely studied rare metals
to the hardly perceptible nebulæ, have been used to justify it. As soon as
spectrum analysis appears as a new and powerful weapon of chemistry, the
idea of a primary matter is immediately attached to it. From all sides we
see attempts to constitute the imaginary substance <i>helium</i><a name="FNanchor_3_537" id="FNanchor_3_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_537" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the so much
longed for primary matter. No attention is paid to the circumstance that
the helium line is only seen in the spectrum of the solar protuberances, so
that its universality in Nature remains as problematic as the primary matter
itself; nor to the fact that the helium line is wanting amongst the Fraunhofer
lines of the solar spectrum, and thus does not answer to the brilliant
fundamental conception which gives its real force to spectrum analysis.</p>

<p>And finally, no notice is even taken of the indubitable fact that the brilliancies
of the spectral lines of the simple substances vary under different temperatures
and pressures; so that all probabilities are in favour of the helium
line simply belonging to some long since known element placed under such
conditions of temperature, pressure, and gravity as have not yet been realised
in our experiments. Again, the idea that the excellent investigations of
Lockyer of the spectrum of iron can be interpreted in favour of the compound
nature of that element, evidently must have arisen from some misunderstanding.
The spectrum of a compound certainly does not appear as a
sum of the spectra of its components; and therefore the observations of
Lockyer can be considered precisely as a proof that iron undergoes no other
changes at the temperature of the sun than those which it experiences in the
voltaic arc&mdash;provided the spectrum of iron is preserved. As to the shifting
of some of the lines of the spectrum of iron while the other lines maintain
their positions, it can be explained, as shown by M. Kleiber (&lsquo;Journal of the
Russian Chemical and Physical Society,&rsquo; 1885, 147), by the relative motion
of the various strata of the sun's atmosphere, and by Zöllner's laws of the
relative brilliancies of different lines of the spectrum. Moreover, it ought
not to be forgotten that if iron were really proved to consist of two or more
unknown elements, we should simply have an increase in the number of our
elements&mdash;not a reduction, and still less a reduction of all of them to one
single primary matter.</p>

<p>Feeling that spectrum analysis will not yield a support to the Pythagorean
conception, its modern promoters are so bent upon its being confirmed by
the periodic law, that the illustrious Berthelot, in his work &lsquo;Les origines de
l'Alchimie,&rsquo; 1885, 313, has simply mixed up the fundamental idea of the law
of periodicity with the ideas of Prout, the alchemists, and Democritus about
primary matter.<a name="FNanchor_4_538" id="FNanchor_4_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_538" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> But the periodic law, based as it is on the solid and wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
ground of experimental research, has been evolved independently of
any conception as to the nature of the elements; it does not in the least
originate in the idea of a unique matter; and it has no historical connection
with that relic of the torments of classical thought, and therefore it
affords no more indication of the unity of matter or of the compound character
of our elements, than the law of Avogadro, or the law of specific heats, or
even the conclusions of spectrum analysis. None of the advocates of a
unique matter have ever tried to explain the law from the standpoint of ideas
taken from a remote antiquity when it was found convenient to admit the
existence of many gods&mdash;and of a unique matter.</p>

<p>When we try to explain the origin of the idea of a unique primary
matter, we easily trace that in the absence of inductions from experiment it
derives its origin from the scientifically philosophical attempt at discovering
some kind of unity in the immense diversity of individualities which we see
around. In classical times such a tendency could only be satisfied by conceptions
about the immaterial world. As to the material world, our ancestors
were compelled to resort to some hypothesis, and they adopted the idea of
unity in the formative material, because they were not able to evolve the
conception of any other possible unity in order to connect the multifarious
relations of matter. Responding to the same legitimate scientific tendency,
natural science has discovered throughout the universe a unity of plan, a
unity of forces, and a unity of matter, and the convincing conclusions of
modern science compel every one to admit these kinds of unity. But while
we admit unity in many things, we none the less must also explain the
individuality and the apparent diversity which we cannot fail to trace everywhere.
It has been said of old, &lsquo;Give us a fulcrum, and it will become easy to
displace the earth.&rsquo; So also we must say, &lsquo;Give us something that is individualised,
and the apparent diversity will be easily understood.&rsquo; Otherwise, how
could unity result in a multitude?</p>

<p>After a long and painstaking research, natural science has discovered the
individualities of the chemical elements, and therefore it is now capable not
only of analysing, but also of synthesising; it can understand and grasp
generality and unity, as well as the individualised and the multifarious.
The general and universal, like time and space, like force and motion, vary uniformly;
the uniform admit of interpolations, revealing every intermediate
phase. But the multitudinous, the individualised&mdash;such as ourselves, or the
chemical elements, or the members of a peculiar periodic function of the
elements, or Dalton's multiple proportions&mdash;is characterised in another
way: we see in it, side by side with a connecting general principle, leaps,
breaks of continuity, points which escape from the analysis of the infinitely
small&mdash;an absence of complete intermediate links. Chemistry has found an
answer to the question as to the causes of multitudes; and while retaining
the conception of many elements, all submitted to the discipline of a general
law, it offers an escape from the Indian Nirvana&mdash;the absorption in the
universal, replacing it by the individualised. However, the place for individuality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
is so limited by the all-grasping, all-powerful universal, that it is
merely a point of support for the understanding of multitude in unity.</p>

<p>Having touched upon the metaphysical bases of the conception of a
unique matter which is supposed to enter into the composition of all bodies.
I think it necessary to dwell upon another theory, akin to the above conception&mdash;the
theory of the compound character of the elements now admitted by
some&mdash;and especially upon one particular circumstance which, being related
to the periodic law, is considered to be an argument in favour of that hypothesis.</p>

<p>Dr. Pelopidas, in 1883, made a communication to the Russian Chemical
and Physical Society on the periodicity of the hydrocarbon radicles, pointing
out the remarkable parallelism which was to be noticed in the change of
properties of hydrocarbon radicles and elements when classed in groups.
Professor Carnelley, in 1886, developed a similar parallelism. The idea of
M. Pelopidas will be easily understood if we consider the series of hydrocarbon
radicles which contain, say, 6 atoms of carbon:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent">The first of these radicles, like the elements of the 1st group, combines with
Cl, OH, and so on, and gives the derivatives of hexyl alcohol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>13</sub>(OH);
but, in proportion as the number of hydrogen atoms decreases, the capacity
of the radicles of combining with, say, the halogens increases. C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub> already
combines with 2 atoms of chlorine; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>11</sub>, with 3 atoms, and so on. The
last members of the series comprise the radicles of acids: thus C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, which
belongs to the 6th group, gives, like sulphur, a bibasic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
which is homologous with oxalic acid. The parallelism can be traced still
further, because C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> appears as a monovalent radicle of benzene, and with
it begins a new series of aromatic derivatives, so analogous to the derivatives of
the aliphatic series. Let me also mention another example from among those
which have been given by M. Pelopidas. Starting from the alkaline radicle
of monomethylammonium, N(CH<sub>3</sub>)H<sub>3</sub>, or NCH<sub>6</sub>, which presents many
analogies with the alkaline metals of the 1st group, he arrives, by successively
diminishing the number of the atoms of hydrogen, at a 7th group which
contains cyanogen, CN, which has long since been compared to the halogens
of the 7th group.</p>

<p>The most important consequence which, in my opinion, can be drawn
from the above comparison is that the periodic law, so apparent in the
elements, has a wider application than might appear at first sight; it opens
up a new vista of chemical evolutions. But, while admitting the fullest
parallelism between the periodicity of the elements and that of the compound
radicles, we must not forget that in the periods of the hydrocarbon radicles
we have a <i>decrease</i> of mass as we pass from the representatives of the first
group to the next, while in the periods of the elements the mass <i>increases</i>
during the progression. It thus becomes evident that we cannot speak of an
identity of periodicity in both cases, unless we put aside the ideas of mass
and attraction, which are the real corner-stones of the whole of natural
science, and even enter into those very conceptions of simple substances which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
came to light a full hundred years later than the immortal principles of
Newton.<a name="FNanchor_5_539" id="FNanchor_5_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_539" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>From the foregoing, as well as from the failures of so many attempts at
finding in experiment and speculation a proof of the compound character of
the elements and of the existence of primordial matter, it is evident, in my
opinion, that this theory must be classed among mere utopias. But utopias
can only be combated by freedom of opinion, by experiment, and by new
utopias. In the republic of scientific theories freedom of opinions is guaranteed.
It is precisely that freedom which permits me to criticise openly the
widely-diffused idea as to the unity of matter in the elements. Experiments
and attempts at confirming that idea have been so numerous that it really
would be instructive to have them all collected together, if only to serve as a
warning against the repetition of old failures. And now as to new utopias
which may be helpful in the struggle against the old ones, I do not think it
quite useless to mention a <i>phantasy</i> of one of my students who imagined that
the weight of bodies does not depend upon their mass, but upon the character
of the motion of their atoms. The atoms, according to this new utopian, may
all be homogeneous or heterogeneous, we know not which; we know them
in motion only, and that motion they maintain with the same persistence as
the stellar bodies maintain theirs. The weights of atoms differ only in consequence
of their various modes and quantity of motion; the heaviest atoms
may be much simpler than the lighter ones: thus an atom of mercury may
be simpler than an atom of hydrogen&mdash;the manner in which it moves causes
it to be heavier. My interlocutor even suggested that the view which
attributes the greater complexity to the lighter elements finds confirmation
in the fact that the hydrocarbon radicles mentioned by Pelopidas, while
becoming lighter as they lose hydrogen, change their properties periodically
in the same manner as the elements change theirs, according as the atoms
grow heavier.</p>

<p>The French proverb, <i>La critique est facile, mais l'art est difficile</i>, however,
may well be reversed in the case of all such ideal views, as it is much
easier to formulate than to criticise them. Arising from the virgin soil of
newly-established facts, the knowledge relating to the elements, to their
masses, and to the periodic changes of their properties has given a motive
for the formation of utopian hypotheses, probably because they could not be
foreseen by the aid of any of the various metaphysical systems, and exist,
like the idea of gravitation, as an independent outcome of natural science,
requiring the acknowledgment of general laws, when these have been established
with the same degree of persistency as is indispensable for the acceptance
of a thoroughly established fact. Two centuries have elapsed since the
theory of gravitation was enunciated, and although we do not understand its
cause, we still must regard gravitation as a fundamental conception of natural
philosophy, a conception which has enabled us to perceive much more than
the metaphysicians did or could with their seeming omniscience. A hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
years later the conception of the elements arose; it made chemistry what it
now is; and yet we have advanced as little in our comprehension of simple
substances since the times of Lavoisier and Dalton as we have in our understanding
of gravitation. The periodic law of the elements is only twenty
years old; it is not surprising, therefore, that, knowing nothing about the
causes of gravitation and mass, or about the nature of the elements, we do
not comprehend the <i>rationale</i> of the periodic law. It is only by collecting
established laws&mdash;that is, by working at the acquirement of truth&mdash;that we
can hope gradually to lift the veil which conceals from us the causes of the
mysteries of Nature and to discover their mutual dependency. Like the
telescope and the microscope, laws founded on the basis of experiment are
the instruments and means of enlarging our mental horizon.</p>

<p>In the remaining part of my communication I shall endeavour to show,
and as briefly as possible, in how far the periodic law contributes to enlarge
our range of vision. Before the promulgation of this law the chemical
elements were mere fragmentary, incidental facts in Nature; there was no
special reason to expect the discovery of new elements, and the new ones
which were discovered from time to time appeared to be possessed of quite
novel properties. The law of periodicity first enabled us to perceive undiscovered
elements at a distance which formerly was inaccessible to chemical
vision; and long ere they were discovered new elements appeared before our
eyes possessed of a number of well-defined properties. We now know three
cases of elements whose existence and properties were foreseen by the instrumentality
of the periodic law. I need but mention the brilliant discovery of
<i>gallium</i>, which proved to correspond to eka-aluminium of the periodic law, by
Lecoq de Boisbaudran; of <i>scandium</i>, corresponding to ekaboron, by Nilson;
and of <i>germanium</i>, which proved to correspond in all respects to ekasilicon,
by Winkler. When, in 1871, I described to the Russian Chemical Society
the properties, clearly defined by the periodic law, which such elements
ought to possess, I never hoped that I should live to mention their discovery
to the Chemical Society of Great Britain as a confirmation of the exactitude
and the generality of the periodic law. Now that I have had the happiness
of doing so, I unhesitatingly say that, although greatly enlarging our vision,
even now the periodic law needs further improvements in order that it may
become a trustworthy instrument in further discoveries.<a name="FNanchor_6_540" id="FNanchor_6_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_540" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>I will venture to allude to some other matters which chemistry has discerned
by means of its new instrument, and which it could not have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
out without a knowledge of the law of periodicity, and I will confine myself
to simple substances and to oxides.</p>

<p>Before the periodic law was formulated the atomic weights of the elements
were purely empirical numbers, so that the magnitude of the equivalent, and
the atomicity, or the value in substitution possessed by an atom, could only
be tested by critically examining the methods of determination, but never
directly by considering the numerical values themselves; in short, we were
compelled to move in the dark, to submit to the facts, instead of being masters
of them. I need not recount the methods which permitted the periodic law
at last to master the facts relating to atomic weights, and I would merely
call to mind that it compelled us to modify the valencies of <i>indium</i> and
<i>cerium</i>, and to assign to their compounds a different molecular composition.
Determinations of the specific heats of these two metals fully confirmed the
change. The trivalency of <i>yttrium</i>, which makes us now represent its oxide
as Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> instead of as YO, was also foreseen (in 1870) by the periodic law, and
it has now become so probable that Clève, and all other subsequent investigators
of the rare metals, have not only adopted it, but have also applied it
without any new demonstration to substances so imperfectly known as those
of the cerite and gadolinite group, especially since Hillebrand determined the
specific heats of lanthanum and didymium and confirmed the expectations
suggested by the periodic law. But here, especially in the case of didymium,
we meet with a series of difficulties long since foreseen through the periodic
law, but only now becoming evident, and chiefly arising from the relative
rarity and insufficient knowledge of the elements which usually accompany
didymium.</p>

<p>Passing to the results obtained in the case of the rare elements <i>beryllium</i>,
<i>scandium</i>, and <i>thorium</i>, it is found that these have many points of contact
with the periodic law. Although Avdéeff long since proposed the magnesia
formula to represent beryllium oxide, yet there was so much to be said in
favour of the alumina formula, on account of the specific heat of the metals
and the isomorphism of the two oxides, that it became generally adopted
and seemed to be well established. The periodic law, however, as Brauner
repeatedly insisted (&lsquo;Berichte,&rsquo; 1878, 872; 1881, 53), was against the formula
Be<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; it required the magnesia formula BeO&mdash;that is, an atomic weight
of 9&mdash;because there was no place in the system for an element like beryllium
having an atomic weight of 13·5. This divergence of opinion lasted for
years, and I often heard that the question as to the atomic weight of beryllium
threatened to disturb the generality of the periodic law, or, at any rate, to
require some important modifications of it. Many forces were operating in
the controversy regarding beryllium, evidently because a much more important
question was at issue than merely that involved in the discussion of
the atomic weight of a relatively rare element: and during the controversy
the periodic law became better understood, and the mutual relations of the
elements became more apparent than ever before. It is most remarkable that
the victory of the periodic law was won by the researches of the very observers
who previously had discovered a number of facts in support of the trivalency
of beryllium. Applying the higher law of Avogadro, Nilson and
Petterson have finally shown that the density of the vapour of the beryllium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
chloride, BeCl<sub>2</sub>, obliges us to regard beryllium as bivalent in
conformity with the periodic law.<a name="FNanchor_7_541" id="FNanchor_7_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_541" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I consider the confirmation of Avdéeff's
and Brauner's view as important in the history of the periodic law as the
discovery of scandium, which, in Nilson's hands, confirmed the existence of
ekaboron.</p>

<p>The circumstance that <i>thorium</i> proved to be quadrivalent, and Th = 232,
in accordance with the views of Chydenius and the requirements of the
periodic law, passed almost unnoticed, and was accepted without opposition,
and yet both thorium and uranium are of great importance in the periodic
system, as they are its last members, and have the highest atomic weights of
all the elements.</p>

<p>The alteration of the atomic weight of <i>uranium</i> from U = 120 into U = 240
attracted more attention, the change having been made on account of the
periodic law, and for no other reason. Now that Roscoe, Rammelsberg,
Zimmermann, and several others have admitted the various claims of the
periodic law in the case of uranium, its high atomic weight is received without
objection, and it endows that element with a special interest.</p>

<p>While thus demonstrating the necessity for modifying the atomic weights
of several insufficiently known elements, the periodic law enabled us also to
detect errors in the determination of the atomic weights of several elements
whose valencies and true position among other elements were already well
known. Three such cases are especially noteworthy: those of tellurium,
titanium and platinum. Berzelius had determined the atomic weight of
<i>tellurium</i> to be 128, while the periodic law claimed for it an atomic weight
below that of iodine, which had been fixed by Stas at 126·5, and which was
certainly not higher than 127. Brauner then undertook the investigation,
and he has shown that the true atomic weight of tellurium is lower than that
of iodine, being near to 125. For <i>titanium</i> the extensive researches of
Thorpe have confirmed the atomic weight of Ti = 48, indicated by the law,
and already foreseen by Rose, but contradicted by the analyses of Pierre and
several other chemists. An equally brilliant confirmation of the expectations
based on the periodic law has been given in the case of the series osmium,
iridium, platinum, and gold. At the time of the promulgation of the periodic
law, the determinations of Berzelius, Rose, and many others gave the following
figures:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">Os = 200&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ir = 197;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pt = 198;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Au = 196.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The expectations of the periodic law<a name="FNanchor_8_542" id="FNanchor_8_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_542" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> have been confirmed, first, by new
determinations of the atomic weight of <i>platinum</i> (by Seubert, Dittmar, and
M'Arthur, which proved to be near to 196 (taking O = 16, as proposed by
Marignac, Brauner, and others); secondly, by Seubert having proved that
the atomic weight of <i>osmium</i> is really lower than that of platinum, being
near to 191; and thirdly, by the investigations of Krüss, Thorpe and
Laurie, proving that the atomic weight of <i>gold</i> exceeds that of platinum,
and approximates to 197. The atomic weights which were thus found to
require correction were precisely those which the periodic law had indicated
as affected with errors; and it has been proved, therefore, that the periodic
law affords a means of testing experimental results. If we succeed in discovering
the exact character of the periodic relationships between the
increments in atomic weights of allied elements discussed by Ridberg in
1885, and again by Bazaroff in 1887, we may expect that our instrument
will give us the means of still more closely controlling the experimental data
relating to atomic weights.</p>

<p>Let me next call to mind that, while disclosing the variation of chemical
properties,<a name="FNanchor_9_543" id="FNanchor_9_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_543" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> the periodic law, has also enabled us to systematically discuss
many of the physical properties of elementary bodies, and to show that these
properties are also subject to the law of periodicity. At the Moscow Congress
of Russian Naturalists in August, 1869, I dwelt upon the relations which
existed between density and the atomic weight of the elements. The following
year Professor Lothar Meyer, in his well-known paper,<a name="FNanchor_10_544" id="FNanchor_10_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_544" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> studied the
same subject in more detail, and thus contributed to spread information
about the periodic law. Later on, Carnelley, Laurie, L. Meyer, Roberts-Austen,
and several others applied the periodic system to represent the order
in the changes of the magnetic properties of the elements, their melting
points, the heats of formation of their haloid compounds, and even of such
mechanical properties as the coefficient of elasticity, the breaking stress, &amp;c.,
&amp;c. These deductions, which have received further support in the discovery
of new elements endowed not only with chemical but even with physical
properties, which were foreseen by the law of periodicity, are well known;
so I need not dwell upon the subject, and may pass to the consideration of
oxides.<a name="FNanchor_11_545" id="FNanchor_11_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_545" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p>In indicating that the gradual increase of the power of elements of combining
with oxygen is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in their
power of combining with hydrogen, the periodic law has shown that there is
a limit of oxidation, just as there is a well-known limit to the capacity of
elements for combining with hydrogen. A single atom of an element combines
with at most four atoms of either hydrogen or oxygen; and while CH<sub>4</sub>
and SiH<sub>4</sub> represent the highest hydrides, so RuO<sub>4</sub> and OsO<sub>4</sub> are the highest
oxides. We are thus led to recognise types of oxides, just as we have had to
recognise types of hydrides.<a name="FNanchor_12_546" id="FNanchor_12_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_546" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>The periodic law has demonstrated that the maximum extent to which
different non-metals enter into combination with oxygen is determined by the
extent to which they combine with hydrogen, and that the sum of the number
of equivalents of both must be equal to 8. Thus chlorine, which combines
with 1 atom or 1 equivalent of hydrogen, cannot fix more than 7 equivalents
of oxygen, giving Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>; while sulphur, which fixes 2 equivalents of hydrogen,
cannot combine with more than 6 equivalents or 3 atoms of oxygen. It thus
becomes evident that we cannot recognise as a fundamental property of the
elements the atomic valencies deduced from their hydrides; and that we
must modify, to a certain extent, the theory of atomicity if we desire to raise
it to the dignity of a general principle capable of affording an insight into the
constitution of all compound molecules. In other words, it is only to carbon,
which is quadrivalent with regard both to oxygen and hydrogen, that we can
apply the theory of constant valency and of bond, by means of which so many
still endeavour to explain the structure of compound molecules. But I should
go too far if I ventured to explain in detail the conclusions which can be
drawn from the above considerations. Still, I think it necessary to dwell
upon one particular fact which must be explained from the point of view of
the periodic law in order to clear the way to its extension in that particular
direction.</p>

<p>The higher oxides yielding salts the formation of which was foreseen by
the periodic system&mdash;for instance, in the short series beginning with sodium&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">Na<sub>2</sub>O,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MgO,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SiO<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SO<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,</p>

<p class="noindent">must be clearly distinguished from the higher degrees of oxidation which correspond
to hydrogen peroxide and bear the true character of peroxides. Peroxides
such as Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BaO<sub>2</sub>, and the like have long been known. Similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
peroxides have also recently become known in the case of chromium, sulphur,
titanium, and many other elements, and I have sometimes heard it said that
discoveries of this kind weaken the conclusions of the periodic law in so far
as it concerns the oxides. I do not think so in the least, and I may remark,
in the first place, that all these peroxides are endowed with certain properties
obviously common to all of them, which distinguish them from the actual,
higher, salt-forming oxides, especially their easy decomposition by means of
simple contact agencies; their incapability of forming salts of the common
type; and their capability of combining with other peroxides (like the faculty
which hydrogen peroxide possesses of combining with barium peroxide, discovered
by Schoene). Again, we remark that some groups are especially
characterised by their capacity of generating peroxides. Such is, for instance,
the case in the sixth group, where we find the well-known peroxides of
sulphur, chromium, and uranium; so that further investigation of peroxides
will probably establish a new periodic function, foreshadowing that molybdenum
and tungsten will assume peroxide forms with comparative readiness.
To appreciate the constitution of such peroxides, it is enough to notice that
the peroxide form of sulphur (so-called persulphuric acid) stands in the same
relation to sulphuric acid as hydrogen peroxide stands to water:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">H(OH), or H<sub>2</sub>O, responds to (OH)(OH), or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,</p>

<p class="noindent">and so also&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">H(HSO<sub>4</sub>), or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, responds to (HSO<sub>4</sub>)(HSO<sub>4</sub>), or H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Similar relations are seen everywhere, and they correspond to the principle
of substitutions which I long since endeavoured to represent as one of the
chemical generalisations called into life by the periodic law. So also
sulphuric acid, if considered with reference to hydroxyl, and represented as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">HO(SO<sub>2</sub>OH),</p>

<p class="noindent">has its corresponding compound in dithionic acid&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">(SO<sub>2</sub>OH)(SO<sub>2</sub>OH), or H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>Therefore, also, phosphoric acid, HO(POH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), has, in the same sense, its
corresponding compound in the subphosphoric acid of Saltzer:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">(POH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)(POH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), or H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>;</p>

<p class="noindent">and we must suppose that the peroxide compound corresponding to phosphoric
acid, if it be discovered, will have the following structure:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">(H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O + 2PO<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_13_547" id="FNanchor_13_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_547" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p class="noindent">So far as is known at present, the highest form of peroxides is met with in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
the peroxide of uranium, UO<sub>4</sub>, prepared by Fairley;<a name="FNanchor_14_548" id="FNanchor_14_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_548" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> while OsO<sub>4</sub> is the
highest oxide giving salts. The line of argument which is inspired by the
periodic law, so far from being weakened by the discovery of peroxides, is
thus actually strengthened, and we must hope that a further exploration of
the region under consideration will confirm the applicability to chemistry
generally of the principles deduced from the periodic law.</p>

<p>Permit me now to conclude my rapid sketch of the oxygen compounds by
the observation that the periodic law is especially brought into evidence in
the case of the oxides which constitute the immense majority of bodies at our
disposal on the surface of the earth.</p>

<p>The oxides are evidently subject to the law, both as regards their chemical
and their physical properties, especially if we take into account the cases of
polymerism which are so obvious when comparing CO<sub>2</sub>, with Si<sub><i>n</i></sub>O<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>. In order
to prove this I give the densities s and the specific volumes v of the higher
oxides of two short periods. To render comparison easier, the oxides are all
represented as of the form R<sub>2</sub>O<sub><i>n</i></sub>. In the column headed &#916; the differences
are given between the volume of the oxygen compound and that of the parent
element, divided by <i>n</i>&mdash;that is, by the number of atoms of oxygen in the
compound:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_15_549" id="FNanchor_15_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_549" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>I have nothing to add to these figures, except that like relations appear in
other periods as well. The above relations were precisely those which made
it possible for me to be certain that the relative density of ekasilicon oxide
would be about 4·7; germanium oxide, actually obtained by Winkler, proved,
in fact, to have the relative density 4·703.</p>

<p>The foregoing account is far from being an exhaustive one of all that has
already been discovered by means of the periodic law telescope in the boundless
realms of chemical evolution. Still less is it an exhaustive account of all
that may yet be seen, but I trust that the little which I have said will account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
for the philosophical interest attached in chemistry to this law. Although
but a recent scientific generalisation, it has already stood the test of laboratory
verification, and appears as an instrument of thought which has not yet been
compelled to undergo modification; but it needs not only new applications,
but also improvements, further development, and plenty of fresh energy. All
this will surely come, seeing that such an assembly of men of science as the
Chemical Society of Great Britain has expressed the desire to have the history
of the periodic law described in a lecture dedicated to the glorious name
of Faraday.</p>

shall give one example, and yet I do not see it quite distinctly. In the series which contains
Hg = 204, Pb = 206, and Bi = 208, we can imagine the existence (at the place VI-11)
of an element analogous to tellurium, which we can describe as dvi-tellurium, Dt, having
an atomic weight of 212, and the property of forming the oxide DtO<sub>3</sub>. If this element
really exists, it ought in the free state to be an easily fusible, crystalline, non-volatile
metal of a grey colour, having a density of about 9·3, capable of giving a dioxide, DtO<sub>2</sub>,
equally endowed with feeble acid and basic properties. This dioxide must give on active
oxidation an unstable higher oxide, DtO<sub>3</sub>, which should resemble in its properties PbO<sub>2</sub>
and Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Dvi-tellurium hydride, if it be found to exist, will be a less stable compound

unnoticed, as it was only published in the Russian chemical literature. Having remarked
(in 1884) that the density of such solutions of chlorides of metals, MCl<sub><i>n</i></sub>, as contain 200
mols. of water (or a large and constant amount of water) regularly increases as the molecular
weight of the dissolved salt increases, I proposed to one of our young chemists,
M. Burdakoff, that he should investigate beryllium chloride. If its molecule be BeCl<sub>2</sub>
its weight must be = 80; and in such a case it must be heavier than the molecule of
KCl = 74·5, and lighter than that of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, = 93. On the contrary, if beryllium chloride is
a trichloride, BeCl<sub>3</sub> = 120, its molecule must be heavier than that of CaCl<sub>2</sub> = 111, and
lighter than that of MnCl<sub>2</sub> = 126. Experiment has shown the correctness of the former
formula, the solution BeCl<sub>2</sub> + 200H<sub>2</sub>O having (at 15°/4°) a density of 1·0138, this being a
higher density than that of the solution KCl + 200H<sub>2</sub>O (= 1·0121), and lower than that of
MgCl<sub>2</sub> + 200H<sub>2</sub>O (= 1·0203). The bivalency of beryllium was thus confirmed in the case
both of the dissolved and the vaporised chloride.</p></div>

<p class="title"><span style="font-size: 110%;"><span class="smcap">Written by</span> PROFESSOR MENDELÉEFF IN FEBRUARY 1895</span></p>

<p>The remarks made in Chapter V., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_16_BIS_294">16 bis</a> respecting the newly discovered
constituent of the atmosphere are here supplemented by data (taken from
the publications of the Royal Society of London) given by the discoverers
Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay in January 1895, together with observations
made by Crookes and Olszewsky upon the same subject.</p>

<p>This gas, which was discovered by Rayleigh and Ramsay in atmospheric
nitrogen, was named <i>argon</i><a name="FNanchor_1_550" id="FNanchor_1_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_550" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> by them, and upon the supposition of
its being an element, they gave it the symbol A. But its true chemical
nature is not yet fully known, for not only has no compound of it been yet
obtained, but it has not even been brought into any reaction. From all that
is known about it at the present time, we may conclude with the discoverers
that argon belongs to those gases which are permanent constituents of the
atmosphere, and that it is a new element. The latter statement, however,
requires confirmation. We shall presently see, however, that the negative
chemical character of argon (its incapacity to react with any substance), and
the small amount of it present in the atmosphere (about 1&frac14; per cent. by
volume in the nitrogen of air, and consequently about 1 per cent. by volume
in air), as well as the recent date of its discovery (1894) and the difficulty
of its preparation, are quite sufficient reasons for the incompleteness of the
existing knowledge respecting this element. But since, so far as is yet known,
we are dealing with a normal constituent of the atmosphere<a name="FNanchor_1_BIS_551" id="FNanchor_1_BIS_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_BIS_551" class="fnanchor">[1 bis]</a>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
existing data, notwithstanding their insufficiently definite nature, should
find a place even in such an elementary work as the present, all the more as
the names of Rayleigh, Ramsay, Crookes and Olszewsky, who have worked
upon argon, are among the highest in our science, and their researches among
the most difficult.<a name="FNanchor_2_552" id="FNanchor_2_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_552" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> These researches, moreover, were directed straight to
the goal, which was only partly reached owing to the unusual properties of
argon itself.</p>

<p>When it became known (Chapter V., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_4_BIS_278">4 bis</a>) that the nitrogen obtained
from air (by removing the oxygen, moisture and CO<sub>2</sub>, by various reagents)
has a greater density than that obtained from the various (oxygen, hydrogen
and metallic) compounds of nitrogen, it was a plausible explanation that the
latter contained an admixture of hydrogen, or of some other light gas lowering
the density of the mixture. But such an assumption is refuted not only
by the fact that the nitrogen obtained from its various compounds (after
purification) has always the same density (although the supposed impurities
mixed with it should vary), but also by Rayleigh and Ramsay's experiment
of artificially adding hydrogen to nitrogen, and then passing the mixture over
red-hot oxide of copper, when it was found that the nitrogen regained its
original density, <i>i.e.</i> that the whole of the hydrogen was removed by this
treatment. Therefore the difference in the density of the two varieties of
nitrogen had to be explained by the presence of a heavier gas in admixture
with the nitrogen obtained from the atmosphere. This hypothesis was confirmed
by the fact that Rayleigh and Ramsay having obtained purified nitrogen
(by removing the O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O), both from ordinary air and from air
which had been previously subjected to atmolysis, that is which had been
passed through porous tubes (of burnt clay, <i>e.g.</i> pipe-stem), surrounded by a
rarefied space, and so deprived of its lighter constituents (chiefly nitrogen),
found that the nitrogen from the air which had been subjected to atmolysis
was heavier than that obtained from air which had not been so treated. This
experiment showed that the nitrogen of air contains an admixture of a gas
which, being heavier than nitrogen itself,<a name="FNanchor_3_553" id="FNanchor_3_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_553" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> diffuses more slowly than nitrogen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
through the porous material. It remained, therefore, to separate this impurity
from the nitrogen. To do this Rayleigh and Ramsay adopted two
methods, converting the nitrogen into solid and liquid substances, either
by absorbing the nitrogen by heated magnesium (Chapter V., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_6_281">6</a>, and
Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_14_841">14</a>), with the formation of nitride of magnesium, or else
by converting it into nitric acid by the action of electric sparks or the presence
of an excess of air and alkali, as in Cavendish's method.<a name="FNanchor_3_BIS_554" id="FNanchor_3_BIS_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_BIS_554" class="fnanchor">[3 bis]</a> In both cases
the nitrogen entered into reaction, while the heavier gas mixed with it
remained inert, and was thus able to be isolated. That is, the argon could be
separated by these means from the excess of atmospheric nitrogen accompanying
it.<a name="FNanchor_4_555" id="FNanchor_4_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_555" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> As an illustration we will describe how argon was obtained
from the atmospheric nitrogen by means of magnesium.<a name="FNanchor_5_556" id="FNanchor_5_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_556" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> To begin with,
it was discovered that when atmospheric nitrogen was passed through a tube
containing metallic magnesium heated to redness, its specific gravity rose to
14·88. As this showed that part of the gas was absorbed by the magnesium,
a mercury gasometer filled with atmospheric nitrogen was taken, and the
gas drawn over soda-lime, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, heated magnesium<a name="FNanchor_6_557" id="FNanchor_6_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_557" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and then through
tubes containing red-hot copper oxide, soda-lime and phosphoric anhydride
to a second mercury gasometer. Every time the gas was repassed through
the tubes, it decreased in volume and increased in density. After repeating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
this for ten days 1,500 c.c. of gas were reduced to 200 cc., and the density
increased to 16·1 (if that of H<sub>2</sub> = 1 and N<sub>2</sub> = 14). Further treatment of the
remainder brought the density up to 19·09. After adding a small quantity
of oxygen and repassing the gas through the apparatus, the density rose to
20·0. To obtain argon by this process Ramsay and Rayleigh (employing a
mercury air pump and mercury gasometers) once treated about 150 litres of
atmospheric nitrogen. On another occasion they treated 7,925 c.c. of air by
the oxidation method and obtained 65 c.c. of argon, which corresponds to
0·82 per cent. The density of the argon obtained by this means was nearly
19·7, while that obtained by the magnesium method varied between 19·09
and 20·38.</p>

<p>Thus the first positive and very important fact respecting argon is that
its specific gravity is nearly 20&mdash;that is, that it is 20 times heavier than
hydrogen, while nitrogen is only 14 times and oxygen 16 times heavier than
hydrogen. This explains the difference observed by Rayleigh between the
densities of nitrogen obtained from its compounds and from the atmosphere
(Chapter V., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_4_BIS_278">4 bis</a>). At 0° and 760 mm. a litre of the former gas weighs
1·2505 grm., while a litre of the latter weighs 1·2572, or taking H = 1, the
density of the first = 13·916, and of the latter = 13·991. If the density of
argon be taken as 20, it is contained in atmospheric nitrogen to the extent of
about 1·23 per cent. by volume, whilst air contains about 0·97 per cent. by
volume.</p>

<p>When argon had been isolated the question naturally arose, was it a new
homogeneous substance having definite properties or was it a mixture of
gases? The former may now be positively asserted, namely, that argon is a
peculiar gas previously unknown to chemistry. Such a conviction is in the
first place established by the fact that argon has a greater number of negative
properties, a smaller capacity for reaction, than any other simple or
compound body known. The most inert gas known is nitrogen, but argon
far exceeds it in this respect. Thus nitrogen is absorbed at a red heat by many
metals, with the formation of nitrides, while argon, as is seen in the mode
of its preparation and by direct experiment, does not possess this property.
Nitrogen, under the action of electric sparks, combines with hydrogen in the
presence of acids and with oxygen in the presence of alkalis, while argon is
unable to do so, as is seen from the method of separation from nitrogen.
Rayleigh and Ramsay also proved that argon is unable to react with chlorine
(dry or moist) either directly or under the action of an electric discharge, or
with phosphorus or sulphur, at a red heat. Sodium, potassium, and tellurium
may be distilled in an atmosphere of argon without change. Fused caustic
soda, incandescent soda-lime, molten nitre, red-hot peroxide of sodium,
and the polysulphides of calcium and sodium also do not react with argon.
Platinum black does not absorb it, and spongy platinum is unable to excite its
reaction with oxygen or chlorine. Aqua regia, bromine water, and a mixture
of hydrochloric acid and KMnO<sub>4</sub> were also without action upon argon. Besides
which it is evident from the method of its preparation that it is not acted upon
by red-hot oxide of copper. All these facts exclude any possibility of argon containing
any already known body, and prove it to be the most inert of all the
gases known. But besides these negative points, the independency of argon is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
confirmed by four observed positive properties possessed by it, which
are:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The spectrum of argon observed by Crookes under a low pressure (in
Geissler-Plücker tubes) distinguishes it from other gases.<a name="FNanchor_7_558" id="FNanchor_7_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_558" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It was proved
by this means that the argon obtained by means of magnesium is identical
with that which remains after the conversion of the atmospheric nitrogen
into nitric acid. Like nitrogen, argon presents two spectra produced at
different potentials of the induced current, one being orange-red, the other
steel-blue; the latter is obtained under a higher degree of rarefaction and
with a battery of Leyden jars. Both the spectra of argon (in contradistinction
to those of nitrogen) are distinguished by clearly defined lines.<a name="FNanchor_8_559" id="FNanchor_8_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_559" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The red
(ordinary) spectrum of argon has two particularly brilliant and characteristic
red lines (not far from the bright red line of lithium, on the opposite side to
the orange band) having wave-lengths 705·64 and 696·56 (<i>see</i> Vol. I.,
p. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Page_565">565</a>). Between these bright lines there are in addition lines with wave
lengths 603·8, 565·1, 561·0, 555·7, 518·58, 516·5, 450·95, 420·10, 415·95 and
394·85. Altogether 80 lines have been observed in this spectrum and 119 in
the blue spectrum, of which 26 are common to both spectra.<a name="FNanchor_9_560" id="FNanchor_9_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_560" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>2. According to Rayleigh and Ramsay the solubility of argon in water
is approximately 4 volumes in 100 volumes of water at 13°. Thus argon
is nearly 2&frac12; times more soluble than nitrogen, and its solubility approaches
that of oxygen. Direct experiment proves that nitrogen obtained
from air from boiled water is heavier than that obtained straight from the
atmosphere. This again is an indirect proof of the presence of argon in
air.</p>

<p>3. The ratio <i>k</i> of the two specific heats (at a constant pressure and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
a constant volume) of argon was determined by Rayleigh and Ramsay by the
method of the velocity of sound (<i>see</i> Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_7_834">7</a> and Chapter VII.,
Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_26_435">26</a>) and was found to be nearly 1·66, that is greater than for those gases
whose molecules contain two atoms (for instance, CO, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, air, &amp;c., for
which <i>k</i> is nearly 1·4) or those whose molecules contain three atoms (for
instance, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c., for which <i>k</i> is about 1·3), but closely approximate
to the ratio of the specific heats of mercury vapour (Kundt and Warburg,
<i>k</i> = 1·67). And as the molecule of mercury vapour contains one atom, so it
may be said that argon is a simple gaseous body whose molecule contains
one atom.<a name="FNanchor_10_561" id="FNanchor_10_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_561" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> A compound body should give a smaller ratio. The experiments
upon the liquefaction of argon, which we shall presently describe, speak
against the supposition that argon is a mixture of two gases. The importance
of the results in question makes one wish that the determinations of the
ratio of the specific heats (and other physical properties) might be confirmed
with all possible accuracy.<a name="FNanchor_11_562" id="FNanchor_11_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_562" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> If we admit, as we are obliged to do for the
present, that argon is a new element, its density shows that its atomic weight
must be nearly 40, that is, near to that of K = 39 and Ca = 40, which does
not correspond to the existing data respecting the periodicity of the properties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
of the elements in dependence upon their atomic weights, for there is no
reason on the basis of existing data for admitting any intermediate elements
between Cl = 35·5 and K = 39, and all the positions above potassium in the
periodic system are occupied. This renders it very desirable that the velocity
of sound in argon should be re-determined.<a name="FNanchor_12_563" id="FNanchor_12_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_563" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>4. Argon was liquefied by Professor Olszewsky, who is well known for his
classical researches upon liquefied gases. These researches have an especial
interest since they show that argon exhibits a perfect constancy in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
properties in the liquid and critical states, which almost<a name="FNanchor_13_564" id="FNanchor_13_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_564" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> disposes of the supposition
that it contains a mixture of two or more unknown gases. As the
first experiments showed, argon remains a gas under a pressure of 100
atmospheres and at a temperature of -90°; this indicated that its critical
temperature was probably below this temperature, as was indeed found to
be the case when the temperature was lowered to -128°·6<a name="FNanchor_14_565" id="FNanchor_14_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_565" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> by means of
liquid ethylene. At this temperature argon easily liquefies to a colourless
liquid under 38 atmospheres. The meniscus begins to disappear at between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
-119°·8 and -121°·6, mean -121° at a pressure of 50·6 atmospheres. The
vapour tension of liquid argon at -128°·6, is 38·0 atmospheres, at -187°
it is one atmosphere, and at -189°·6 it solidifies to a colourless substance
like ice. The specific gravity of liquid argon at about -187° is nearly 1·5,
which is far above that of other liquefied gases of very low absolute boiling
point.</p>

<p>The discovery of argon is one of the most remarkable chemical acquisitions
of recent times, and we trust that Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay,
who made this wonderful discovery, will further elucidate the true nature of
argon, as this should widen the fundamental principles of chemistry, to which
the chemists of Great Britain have from early times made such valuable
contributions. It would be premature now to give any definite opinions
upon so new a subject. Only one thing can be said; argon is so inert that
its rôle in nature cannot be considerable, notwithstanding its presence in the
atmosphere. But as the atmosphere itself plays such a vast part in the
life of the surface of the earth, every addition to our knowledge of its composition
must directly or indirectly react upon the sum total of our knowledge
of nature.</p>

of argon, it might possibly be polymerised nitrogen, N<sub>3</sub>, bearing the same relationship to
nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, that ozone, O<sub>3</sub>, bears to ordinary oxygen. If this idea were confirmed, still
one would not imagine that argon was formed from the atmospheric nitrogen by those
reactions by which it was obtained by Rayleigh and Ramsay, but rather that it arises
from the nitrogen of the atmosphere under natural conditions. Although this proposition
is not quite destroyed by the more recent results, still it is contradicted by the fact that
the ratio of the specific heats of argon was found to be 1·66, which, as far as is now known,
could not be the case for a gas containing 3 atoms in its molecule, since such gases (<i>see</i>
Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_7_834">7</a>) give the ratio approximately 1·3 (for example, CO<sub>2</sub>). In abstaining
from further conclusions, for they must inevitably be purely conjectural, I consider
it advisable to suggest that in conducting further researches upon argon it might be well
to subject it to as high a temperature as possible. And the possibility of nitrogen
polymerising is all the more admissible from the fact that the aggregation of its atoms
in the molecule is not at all unlikely, and that polymerised nitrogen, judging from many
examples, might be inert if the polymerisation were accompanied by the evolution of
heat. In the following footnotes I frequently return to this hypothesis, not only because
I have not yet met any facts definitely contradictory to it, but also because the chief
properties of argon agree with it to a certain extent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_552" id="Footnote_2_552"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_552"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The chief difficulty in investigating argon lies in the fact that its preparation requires
the employment of a large quantity of air, which has to be treated with a number of
different reagents, whose perfect purity (especially that of magnesium) will always be
doubtful, and argon has not yet been transferred to a substance in which it could be easily
purified. Perhaps the considerable solubility of argon in water (or in other suitable
liquids, which have not apparently yet been tried) may give the means of doing so, and it
may be possible, by collecting the air expelled from boiling water, to obtain a richer source
of argon than ordinary air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_553" id="Footnote_3_553"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_553"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It might also be supposed that this heavy gas is separated by the copper when the
latter absorbs the oxygen of the air; but such a supposition is not only improbable in
itself, but does not agree with the fact that nitrogen may be obtained from air by absorbing
the oxygen by various other substances in solution (for instance, by the lower oxides
of the metals, like FeO) besides red-hot copper, and that the nitrogen obtained is always
just as heavy. Besides which, nitrogen is also set free from its oxides by copper, and the
nitrogen thus obtained is lighter. Therefore it is not the copper which produces the
heavy gas&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> argon.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_BIS_554" id="Footnote_3_BIS_554"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_BIS_554"><span class="label">[3 bis]</span></a> It is worthy of note that Cavendish obtained a small residue of gas in converting
nitrogen into nitric acid; but he paid no attention to it, although probably he
had in his hands the very argon recently discovered.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_555" id="Footnote_4_555"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_555"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> When in these experiments, instead of atmospheric nitrogen the gas obtained from
its compound was taken, an inert residue of a heavy gas, having the properties of argon,
was also remarked, but its amount was very small. Rayleigh and Ramsay ascribe the
formation of this residue to the fact that the gas in these experiments was collected over
water, and a portion of the dissolved argon in it might have passed into the nitrogen. As
the authors of this supposition did not prove it by any special experiments, it forms a
weak point in their classical research. If it be admitted that argon is N<sub>3</sub>, the fact of its
being obtained from the nitrogen of compounds might be explained by the polymerisation
of a portion of the nitrogen in the act of reaction, although it is impossible to refute
Rayleigh and Ramsay's hypothesis of its being evolved from the water employed in the
manipulation of the gases. Three thousand volumes of nitrogen extracted from its
compounds gave about three volumes of argon, while thirty volumes were yielded by the
same amount of atmospheric nitrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_556" id="Footnote_5_556"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_556"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The preparation of argon by the conversion of nitrogen into nitric acid is complicated
by the necessity of adding a large proportion of oxygen and alkali, of passing an electric
discharge through the mixture for a long period, and then removing the remaining
oxygen. All this was repeatedly done by the authors, but this method is far more
complex, both in practice and theory, than the preparation of argon by means of
magnesium. From 100 volumes of air subjected to conversion into HNO<sub>3</sub>, 0·76 volume
of argon were obtained after absorbing the excess of oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_557" id="Footnote_6_557"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_557"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> In these and the following experiments the magnesium was placed in an ordinary
hard glass tube, and heated in a gas furnace to a temperature almost sufficient to soften
the glass. The current of gas must be very slow (a tube containing a small quantity of
sulphuric acid served as a meter), as otherwise the heat evolved in the formation of the
Mg<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> (Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_14_841">14</a>) will melt the tube.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_558" id="Footnote_7_558"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_558"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The greatest brilliancy of the spectrum of argon is obtained at a tension of 3 mm.,
while for nitrogen it is about 75 mm. (Crookes). In Chapter V., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_16_BIS_294">16 bis</a>, it is said
that the same blue line observed in the spectrum of argon is also observed in the spectrum
of nitrogen. This is a mistake, since there is no coincidence between the blue lines of
the argon and nitrogen spectra. However, we may add that for nitrogen the following
moderately bright lines are known of wave-lengths 585, 574, 544, 516, 457, 442, 436, and
426, which are repeated in the spectra (red and blue) of argon, judging by Crookes'
researches (1895); but it is naturally impossible to assert that there is perfect identity
until some special comparative work has been done in this subject, which is very desirable,
and more especially for the bluish-violet portion of the spectrum, more particularly
between the lines 442&ndash;436, as these lines are distinguished by their brilliancy in both the
argon and nitrogen spectra. The above-mentioned supposition of argon being polymerised
nitrogen (N<sub>3</sub>), formed from nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), with the evolution of heat, might find some
support should it be found after careful comparison that even a limited number of
spectral lines coincided.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_559" id="Footnote_8_559"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_559"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> At first the spectrum of argon exhibits the nitrogen lines, but after a certain time
these lines disappear (under the influence of the platinum, and also of Al and Mg, but
with the latter the spectrum of hydrogen appears) and leave a pure argon spectrum. It
does not appear clear to me whether a polymerisation here takes place or a simple
absorption. Perhaps the elucidation of this question would prove important in the
history of argon. It would be desirable to know, for instance, whether the volume of
argon changes when it is first subjected to the action of the electric discharge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_560" id="Footnote_9_560"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_560"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Crookes supposes that argon contains a mixture of two gases, but as he gives no
reasons for this, beyond certain peculiarities of a spectroscopic character, we will not
consider this hypothesis further.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_561" id="Footnote_10_561"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_561"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This portion of Rayleigh and Ramsay's researches deserves particular attention as,
so far, no gaseous substance is known whose molecule contains but one atom. Were it
not for the above determinations, it might be thought that argon, having a density 20,
has a complex molecule, and may be a compound or polymerised body, for instance, N<sub>3</sub>
or NX<sub><i>n</i></sub>, or in general X<sub><i>n</i></sub>; but as the matter stands, it can only be said that either (1)
argon is a new, peculiar, and quite unusual elementary substance, since there is no
reason for assuming it to contain two simple gases, or (2) the magnitude, <i>k</i> (the ratio of
the specific heats) does not only depend upon the number of atoms contained in the
molecules, but also upon the store of internal energy (internal motion of the atoms in
the molecule). Should the latter be admitted, it would follow that the molecules of very
active gaseous elements would correspond to a smaller <i>k</i> than those of other gases having
an equal number of atoms in their molecule. Such a gas is chlorine, for which <i>k</i> = 1·33
(Chapter XIV., Note <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/51326/51326-h/51326-h.htm#Footnote_7_834"></a>). For gases having a small chemical energy, on the contrary, a
larger magnitude would be expected for <i>k</i>. I think these questions might be partially
settled by determining <i>k</i> for ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) and sulphur (S<sub>6</sub>) (at about 500°). In other words,
I would suggest, though only provisionally, that the magnitude, <i>k</i> = 1·6, obtained for
argon might prove to agree with the hypothesis that argon is N<sub>3</sub>, formed from N<sub>2</sub> with
the evolution of heat or loss of energy. Here argon gives rise to questions of primary
importance, and it is to be hoped that further research will throw some light upon them.
In making these remarks, I only wish to clear the road for further progress in the study
of argon, and of the questions depending on it. I may also remark that if argon is N<sub>3</sub>
formed with the evolution of heat, its conversion into nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>, and into nitride
compounds (for instance, boron nitride or nitride of titanium) might only take place at a
very high temperature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_562" id="Footnote_11_562"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_562"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Without having the slightest reason for doubting the accuracy of Rayleigh and
Ramsay's determinations, I think it necessary to say that as yet (February 1895) I am
only acquainted with the short memoir of the above chemists in the &lsquo;Proceedings of the
Royal Society,&rsquo; which does not give any description of the methods employed and results
obtained, while at the end (in the general conclusions) the authors themselves express
some doubt as to the simple nature of argon. Moreover, it seems to me that (Note <a href="#Footnote_10_561">10</a>)
there must be a dependence of <i>k</i> upon the chemical energy. Besides which, it is not
clear what density of the gas Rayleigh and Ramsay took in determining <i>k</i>. (If argon be
N<sub>3</sub>, its density would be near to 21.) Hence I permit myself to express some doubt as to
whether the molecule of argon contains but one atom.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_563" id="Footnote_12_563"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_563"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> If it should be found that <i>k</i> for argon is less than 1·4, or that <i>k</i> is dependent upon
the chemical energy, it would be possible to admit that the molecule of argon contains
not one, but several atoms&mdash;for instance, either N<sub>3</sub> (then the density would be 21, which
is near to the observed density) or X<sub>6</sub>, if X stand for an element with an atomic weight
near to 6·7. No elements are known between H = 1 and Li = 7, but perhaps they may
exist. The hypothesis A = 40 does not admit argon into the periodic system. If the
molecule of argon be taken as A<sub>2</sub>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the atomic weight as A = 20&mdash;argon apparently
finds a place in Group VIII., between F = 19 and Na = 23; but such a position could only
be justified by the consideration that elements of small atomic weight belong to the
category of typical elements which offer many peculiarities in their properties, as is
seen on comparing N with the other elements of Group V., or O with those of Group VI.
Apart from this there appears to me to be little probability, in the light of the periodic
law, in the position of an inert substance like argon in Group VIII., between such active
elements as fluorine and sodium, as the representatives of this group by their atomic
weights and also by their properties show distinct transitions from the elements of the
last groups of the uneven series to the elements of the first groups of the even series&mdash;for
instance,</p>

<p class="noindent">although from a numerical point of view there is a similar sequence to the above, still
from a chemical and physical point of view the result is quite different, as there is no
such resemblance between the properties of O, F and Na, Mg, as between Cr, Mn, and
Cu, Zn. I repeat that only the typical character of the elements with small atomic
weights can justify the atomic weight A = 20, and the placing of argon in Group VIII.
amongst the typical elements; then N, O, F, A are a series of gases.</p>

<p>It appears to me simpler to assume that argon contains N<sub>3</sub>, especially as argon is
present in nitrogen and accompanies it, and, as a matter of fact, none of the observed
properties of argon are contradictory to this hypothesis.</p>

<p>These observations were written by me in the beginning of February 1895, and on
the 29th of that month I received a letter, dated February 25, from Professor Ramsay
informing me that &lsquo;the periodic classification entirely corresponds to its (argon's) atomic
weight, and that it even gives a fresh proof of the periodic law,&rsquo; judging from the
researches of my English friends. But in what these researches consisted, and how the
above agreement between the atomic weight of argon and the periodic system was arrived
at, is not referred to in the letter, and we remain in expectation of a first publication of
the work of Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsey. [For more complete information see
papers read before the Royal Society, January 31, 1895, February 13, March 10, and

and <i>s</i> the specific gravity in a liquid state at <i>t</i>.</p>

<p>The above shows that argon in its properties in a liquid state stands near to oxygen
(as it also does in its solubility), but that all the temperatures relating to it (<i>tc</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>t<sub>1</sub></i>)
are higher than for nitrogen. This fully answers, not only to the higher density of argon,
but also to the hypothesis that it contains N<sub>3</sub>. And as the boiling point of argon differs
from that of nitrogen and oxygen by less than 10°, and its amount is small, it is easy to
understand how Dewar (1894), who tried to separate it from liquid air and nitrogen by
fractional distillation, was unable to do so. The first and last portions were identical,
and nitrogen from air showed no difference in its liquefaction from that obtained from
its compounds, or from that which had been passed through a tube containing incandescent
magnesium. Still, it is not quite clear why both kinds of nitrogen, after being passed
over the magnesium in Dewar's experiments, exhibited an almost similar alteration in
their properties, independent of the appearance of a small quantity of hydrogen in them.</p>

<p><i>Concluding Remarks</i> (March 31, 1895).&mdash;The &lsquo;Comptes rendus&rsquo; of the Paris
Academy of Sciences of March 18, 1895, contains a memoir by Berthelot upon the reaction
of argon with the vapour of benzene under the action of a silent discharge. In his experiments,
Berthelot succeeded in treating 83 per cent. of the argon taken for the
purpose, and supplied to him by Ramsay (37 c.c. in all). The composition of the product
could not be determined owing to the small amount obtained, but in its outward
appearance it quite resembled the product formed under similar conditions by nitrogen.
This observation of the famous French chemist to some extent supports the supposition
that argon is a polymerised variety of nitrogen whose molecule contains N<sub>3</sub>, while ordinary
nitrogen contains N<sub>2</sub>. Should this supposition be eventually verified, the interest in
argon will not only not lessen, but become greater. For this, however, we must wait for
further observations and detailed experimental data from Rayleigh and Ramsay.</p>

<p>The latest information obtained by me from London is that Professor Ramsay, by
treating cleveite (containing PbO, UO<sub>3</sub>, Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.) with sulphuric acid, obtained argon,
and, judging by the spectrum, helium also. The accumulation of similar data may, after
detailed and diversified research, considerably increase the stock of chemical knowledge
which, constantly widening, cannot be exhaustively treated in these &lsquo;Principles of
Chemistry,&rsquo; although very probably furnishing fresh proof of the &lsquo;periodicity of the
elements.&rsquo;</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
